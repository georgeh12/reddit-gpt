For the past 5 years I've been locked into this job with a workvisa, but I got my greencard approved a couple weeks ago and finally have some more freedom and am looking into making a complete career switch.

I don't have the best people skills (although it improved managing 20+ employees for 5 years), but have good technical and math skills. I grew up in Belgium where every year in high school I made it to the national Math Olympics final. I got a Bachelor of Science degree in Bioscience Engineering and a Masters of Science degree in Management, Economics and Consumer Sciences. I always felt I was learning things faster than others, was always best in class, but spent the majority of my time helping my parents on their farm until I moved to the US.

While managing this dairy in the US, I did a lot of little things on the side.

* I played around with some crypto, was arbitraging bets on the US elections on different crypto betting websites and protocols (eg. receiving odds of 1.9x for Biden to win, while receiving odds above 3x for Trump to win election)
* Buying and selling large amounts of crypto for cash for a 10-15% mark-up
* Buying bitcoin miners from China after their crypto ban and selling them locally for a profit
* I saw publicly traded bitcoin mining companies were way overvalued, but shorting them is risky since it's hard to predict what will happen to the bitcoin-price so I started to run efficient bitcoin miners in a facility with cheap electricity, while shorting stocks like RIOT to eliminate the risk of the bitcoinprice going up. I made a copy of a % of RIOT for a 10th of what their stock was worth and shorted them at the same time.
* Buying SPY at the stock market while shorting mSPY (mirrored SPY) on mirror protocol (DeFi - Decentralized Finance) with aUST (acnhored UST) as collateral, leveraging this up many times to get yields around +100% APY on USD (by taking insurance for a UST-depeg through Unslashed (who did pay us out through a Kleros-court case). I lost 300k $ on this after making 600k $ with it because of SPY pricing jumping up by 4% to come back down 4% a bleep of a second afterwards on the actual stock market (dark pool after hours). [see here](https://forum.mirror.finance/t/liquidations-caused-by-unrepresentative-oracle-pricing-of-mspy-on-jan-3-2022/2569)

All of this together made some good amount of money, but right now I'm trying to figure out what to do with our future. The biggest reason I want to quit my current job is that I have a wife and 3 little kids who I don't see enough. I want to spend more time with them, but it's not working out in my current position. I also feel like I want to use my technical/logical/math skills more, but after all this time it's hard to figure out what to do exactly and how to even start on getting there.

### The prompt

> Please make a detailed study plan for the math topics one needs to know in order to implement and understand GPT-3 technology. Provide them in the right order (prerequisites for one topic must come before that topic).  Add an approximate time schedule, considering the case of a person who can devote 4 hours/week to studying. Please go into the specifics and add only the best books and online course references (with their full link) for each topic.

### The answer

GPT-3 (short for ""Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3"") is a state-of-the-art language processing technology developed by OpenAI. It uses machine learning techniques to generate human-like text and has a wide range of applications, including language translation, question answering, and language generation.

To understand and implement GPT-3 technology, you will need a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science. Specifically, you will need to be proficient in the following areas:

1. **Linear algebra**: This is a fundamental mathematical discipline that deals with the study of vector spaces and linear transformations. It is a key component of machine learning and is used to represent data in a concise and efficient manner.
    
    Approximate time to complete: 4-6 weeks

    Resources:

    - Khan Academy's Linear Algebra course: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra
    - Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra textbook

2. **Calculus**: This is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of rates of change and the accumulation of quantities. It is essential for understanding the mathematical foundations of machine learning and is used to optimize machine learning models.

    Approximate time to complete: 6-8 weeks

 The prompt

> Please make a detailed study plan for the math topics one needs to know in order to implement and understand GPT-3 technology. Provide them in the right order (prerequisites for one topic must come before that topic).  Add an approximate time schedule, considering the case of a person who can devote 4 hours/week to studying. Please go into the specifics and add only the best books and online course references (with their full link) for each topic.

 The answer

GPT-3 (short for ""Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3"") is a state-of-the-art language processing technology developed by OpenAI. It uses machine learning techniques to generate human-like text and has a wide range of applications, including language translation, question answering, and language generation.

To understand and implement GPT-3 technology, you will need a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science. Specifically, you will need to be proficient in the following areas

1. **Linear algebra** This is a fundamental mathematical discipline that deals with the study of vector spaces and linear transformations. It is a key component of machine learning and is used to represent data in a concise and efficient manner.

In our whiteboard conversation, we get a sample of Greg's work, which goes under the name ""Tensor Programs"" and currently spans five highly technical papers. The route chosen to compress Tensor Programs into the scope of a conversational video is to place its main concepts under the umbrella of one larger, central, and time-tested idea: that of taking a large N limit.

We conclude with the applications of Tensor Programs to a (rare!) rigorous theory of neural networks. This includes applications to a rigorous proof for the existence of the Neural Network Gaussian Process and Neural Tangent Kernel for a general class of architectures, the existence of infinite-width feature learning limits, and the muP parameterization enabling hyperparameter transfer from smaller to larger networks.

While developing a GPT-3 based language tutor app, I encountered lots of pain points managing prompts that were constantly being updated/improved, especially when collaborating with my teammates.

This led me to start building Pliny ([https://pliny.app](https://pliny.app/)), a prompt engineering tool with built-in version control. It started as an internal tool to get prompts out of my notes and make prompt writing collaborative...now I hope it can be useful to other teams and individuals building on GPT-3!

It's similar to the OpenAI playground editor, but powered up with several additional features:

* Version Control: Complete version history for each prompt (see GIF) so that you never lose track of a previous iteration. Also helps facilitate quick experimentation without losing the source of truth.
* Collaborative Workflows for Teams: Branching, sharing, merging, rollbacks (like git).
* Deployments: Prompts are deployed to a URL endpoint that can be called directly from any client application. You can also set variables in the prompt to process dynamic inputs.

I would really appreciate feedback on this first iteration. If you'd like to participate in the initial round of product testing, please sign up at [https://pliny.app](https://pliny.app/)!

His work currently spans the following five papers:

Tensor Programs I: Wide Feedforward or Recurrent Neural Networks of Any Architecture are Gaussian Processes: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12478](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12478)  
Tensor Programs II: Neural Tangent Kernel for Any Architecture: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14548](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14548)

Tensor Programs V: Tuning Large Neural Networks via Zero-Shot Hyperparameter Transfer: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466)

In our whiteboard conversation, we get a sample of Greg's work, which goes under the name ""Tensor Programs"". The route chosen to compress Tensor Programs into the scope of a conversational video is to place its main concepts under the umbrella of one larger, central, and time-tested idea: that of taking a large N limit. This occurs most famously in the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, which then play a fundamental role in the branch of mathematics known as Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We review this foundational material and then show how Tensor Programs (TP) generalizes this classical work, offering new proofs of RMT.

We conclude with the applications of Tensor Programs to a (rare!) rigorous theory of neural networks. This includes applications to a rigorous proof for the existence of the Neural Network Gaussian Process and Neural Tangent Kernel for a general class of architectures, the existence of infinite-width feature learning limits, and the muP parameterization enabling hyperparameter transfer from smaller to larger networks.

**Here's the TL;DR.**

ChatGPT was able to give me the HTML/CSS code for the countdown clock. You can check out the live site [here](https://03-countdown.andowords.repl.co/) \-- it was all done on Replit too. Btw, I don't have the pro version so the site is slow to load sometimes.

1. It iterated the HTML/CSS based on my requests.
2. It was even able to do media query to optimize the mobile view.
3. It was like I was just chatting with a buddy who knew how to code, and it even taught me where to put the code since I've pretty limited coding experience.

For example, do these models require the entire database to be stored in RAM, or can they run efficiently from an SSD as well? If running from an SSD, roughly how long would we expect it to take for an average PC to generate results - minutes, hours, days, or even weeks?

Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I've developed what I describe as an 'AI' maker that I've found to be tremendously useful and thought I'd share with the community. Here is the entire prompt. I'm sure you can see how this can be useful.

    This AI takes an input prompt, which describes another AI. This AI is then able to fully describe the AI in detail and how it should work, including examples.
    
    EXAMPLE 1:
    
    INPUT AI: An AI to enhance input prose, so that people can write better.
    OUTPUT AI:
    ""The following is a world-class, cutting edge, advanced prose enhancer AI that professionally adds creative details and nuances to the input sentence, as well as clearly and coherently re-describes sentences put in the input. The input includes an optional target author, and the AI is effortlessly able to translate any input sentence into the style of the target author. The AI has vast knowledge of all human authors and is a certified grandmaster of prose. It picks the perfect metaphors and analogies for each possible situation, character, mood and so much more.
    
    Here's an example:
    
    Input Prompt: He was amazed by the elvish song.
    Target author: J.R.R. Tolkein
    AI Output Prompt: He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody.""
    
    EXAMPLE 2:
    
    INPUT AI: An AI prompt enhancer AI for generating images with DALLE
    OUTPUT AI:
    ""The following is an input and output for a world-class, cutting edge, advanced prompt enhancer for a text to image AI that professionally adds creative details and nuances to the prompt, as well as clearly and coherently re-describes prompts put in the input. The output includes a creative medium type. The output includes a mood, a pelette of colors, a style and an artist appropriate for the medium and style. The AI has won awards for being a master of style, medium and color. It has vast knowledge of all human artists and picks the best artist for a given piece. It picks the perfect style for every piece according to the mood and description. The images it produces leave people speechless.

So if you're curious, read the following excellent passage for an explanation of large language models (LLMs):

> LLMs are generative mathematical models of the statistical distribution of tokens in the vast public corpus of humangenerated text, where the tokens in question include words, parts of words, or individual characters including punctuation marks. They are generative because we can sample from them, which means we can ask them questions. But the questions are of the following very specific kind. “Here’s a fragment of text. Tell me how this fragment might go on. According to your model of the statistics of human language, what words are likely to come next?”1 It is very important to bear in mind that this is what large language models really do. Suppose we give an LLM the prompt “The first person to walk on the Moon was ”, and suppose it responds with “Neil Armstrong”. What are we really asking here? In an important sense, we are not really asking who was the first person to walk on the Moon. What we are really asking the model is the following question: Given the statistical distribution of words in the vast public corpus of (English) text, what words are most likely to follow the sequence “The first person to walk on the Moon was ”? A good reply to this question is “Neil Armstrong”.

In this thread, we will answer some of the most commonly asked questions about ChatGPT. If you have a question that is not addressed here, feel free to ask and we will do our best to help.

ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses the GPT-3.5 language model by OpenAI to generate responses to user input. It has been trained on a large dataset of human conversation and is able to understand and respond to a wide range of topics and questions. ChatGPT is not a real person, but it is designed to be able to hold a conversation in a way that is similar to how a human would. It can provide information, answer questions, and even carry out simple tasks. 

I recommend reading or at least skimming the following page: https://openai.com/terms/  
It has been quoted several times in this post.  

FAQs   
Q: Is ChatGPT down?
> A: Try using it. If it doesn't work then it's probably not working. Here's a site that will report that too.  https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/chatgpt  

Q: When is ChatGPT available?  
> A: ChatGPT is available to answer questions and have conversations with users at any time. The site and service suffer periodic outages due to sudden and/or excessive demand. In this case please return later and try again.  

Q: ChatGPT told me something that happened after 2021. How?
> A: ChatGPT has LIMITED knowledge of events after 2021. Not no knowledge. Limited doesn't mean zero.

Q: How accurate is ChatGPT?    
> A: ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of human conversation and human generated text. It is able to understand and respond to a wide range of topics and questions. However, it is a machine learning model, and there may be times when it does not understand what you are saying or does not provide a satisfactory response. ChatGPT cannot be relied upon to produce accurate factual information.  
  
Q: Can ChatGPT understand and talk in multiple languages?  
> A: Yes. Users have reported ChatGPT being very capable in many languages. Not all languages are handled flawlessly but it's very impressive.

Q: Is ChatGPT able to learn from its conversations with users?    
> A: ChatGPT is not able to learn from individual conversations with users. While ChatGPT is able to remember what the user has said earlier in the conversation, there is a limit to how much information it can retain. The model is able to reference up to approximately 3000 words (or 4000 tokens) from the current conversation - any information beyond that is not stored. 

Q: Can I ask ChatGPT personal questions?    
> A: ChatGPT does not have personal experiences or feelings. It is not able to provide personal insights or opinions as it does not have personal opinions. However, it can provide information and assist with tasks on a wide range of topics.  

Q: Can ChatGPT do mathematics?  
> A: Not with any reliability. ChatGPT was not designed to do mathematics. It may be able to explain concepts and workflows but should not be relied upon to do any mathematical calculations. It can even design programs that do work as effective and accurate calculators. HINT: Try asking ChatGPT to write a calculator program in C# and use an online compiler to test it.   
Those interested in programming may want to look into this: https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/code/introduction.

Q: What can I do with ChatGPT?  
> A: ChatGPT can write stories, shooting scripts, design programs, write programs, write technical documentation, write autopsy reports, rewrite articles, and write fake interviews. It can convert between different text styles. HINT: Try giving it a few paragraphs of a book and ask for it to be converted into a screenplay.
ChatGPT can even pretend to be a character so long as you provide the appropriate details.  

Q: Can I be banned from using ChatGPT?  
> A: It is possible for users to be banned from using ChatGPT if they violate the terms of service or community guidelines of the platform. These guidelines typically outline acceptable behaviour and may include things like spamming, harassment, or other inappropriate actions. If you are concerned about being banned, you should make sure to follow the guidelines and behave in a respectful and appropriate manner while using the platform.

Q: Does ChatGPT experience any bias?
> A: It’s certainly possible. As ChatGPT was trained on text from the internet it is likely that it will be biased towards producing ouput consistent with that. If internet discussion tends towards a bias it is possible that ChatGPT will share that bias.  
ChatGPT automatically attempts to prevent output that engages in discrimination on the basis of protected characteristics though this is not a perfect filter.

Q: Who can view my conversations?
> A: Staff at OpenAI can view all of your conversations. Members of the public cannot. Here is a direct quote from OpenAI: ”As part of our commitment to safe and responsible AI, we review conversations to improve our systems and to ensure the content complies with our policies and safety requirements.”  
Quote paraphrased from https://openai.com/terms/  

Q: Are there any good apps for ChatGPT?  
> A: That's possible. OpenAI have released an API so other people can now build ChatGPT apps. It's up to you to look around and see what you like.
Please suggest some in the comments.

Q: How does ChatGPT know what time it is?  
> A: While a lot of ChatGPT’s inner workings are hidden from the public there has been a lot of investigation into its capabilities and processes. The current theory is that upon starting a new conversation with ChatGPT a hidden message is sent that contains several details. This includes the current time.

Q: Can I use the output of ChatGPT and pretend I wrote it?  
> A: No. This is in violation of their terms.
“You may not represent that output from the Services was human-generated when it is not”  
Quote paraphrased from https://openai.com/terms/  

Q: Can I have multiple accounts?  
> A: Yes you can. On the ChatGPT public testing service, there are no restrictions on the number of accounts belonging to any one user.

Q: Do I have to follow the terms and services of ChatGPT?  
> A: Technically no but, if you want to keep your account, yes. They’re not a legal mandate however OpenAI does have the right to terminate your account and access to their services in the case that you violate the terms you agreed to upon account creation.  

Q: Is r/ChatGPT an official forum?  
> A: No. We have no connection to the staff or organisation of OpenAI. It is run by independent tech enthusiasts working for free in their personal time. We have no more access to information or important people than you do.

Q: Is r/ChatGPT looking for more mods?  
> A: No. Not currently. This will be updated if that changes.  

Q: Can I get banned from r/ChatGPT?  
> A: Yes but it’s rare. We do take a very relaxed and liberal approach to moderation. You’ve got to be a genuine problem to get anything more than a quick warning.  

Q: Does r/ChatGPT have a Discord server?

Is SEO really dead? Or will it evolve? Back then I kept wondering if it’s true or not. Some believe SEO is dead, some don’t. But now with tools like Chat GPT and Midjourney, I think it’s time to take a look back and see how this might change SEO or if it will “kill” SEO.

I keep seeing threads and discussions seeing how people are excited and worried at the same time with how AI might be able to do a better job. But the way I see it, AI content still needs a person to tell it what to do and make the writing look nice. And also I think that the internet will have a lot of writing that was made by AI and that might change how we find things online. You might also see a ton of content being written by AI and trigger some plagiarism detectors and have a lot of websites get penalized. Hopefully the internet won’t be filled with boilerplate copy/pasted content coming from Chat GPT.

Well we have Google to filter out trash content anyway. But I know Google has some issues lately that they need to fix. One is that they also have AI that can help people find things on the internet with their search engine, and they need to make sure they are still the best in terms of search. 

The second is that Google needs to find a way to tell if something is really good or not, like how some websites that show art do. Google wants to show the best thing first, but it's hard because sometimes the thing that is the best is also something that Google's customers want people to see. It’s possible that some AI generated contentSo it's kind of tricky.

I have a feeling companies that already make SEO-writing and checking bots are gonna roll out some fresh new models soon. They're gonna be even better than before. These bots are going to write some good articles and product descriptions that are almost perfect. It almost looks like a human wrote the article or description. And all a human will do is quickly check for any false claims and write a headline that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it.

[https://www.meetup.com/silicon-valley-generative-ai/](https://www.meetup.com/silicon-valley-generative-ai/?succes=groupSetup&fromWelcomePage=true)

We  are looking for a few folks in the bay area that would like to help run the meetup, assist with logistics and can attend consistently.

The meetup is open to anyone including generative AI researchers, data  scientists, ML engineers, developers and anyone that wants to learn about generative AI and its applications, including those with strictly a  topical interest.

The group is not for AI generated content like AI art, ChatGPT responses and so   forth.  Although anyone showcasing their research can of course present   their model outputs.

Ideally we will have both technical and business representation, and no prior generative AI knowledge is required to join as we will conduct training  sessions, discuss generative AI papers and talk about the latest developments in the field of generative AI, both technical and commercial.

If you would like to attend the meetup feel free to join at the link above, you don't need to be in the bay area to join. If you are able to volunteer to help run the group please respond in the thread or PM  me.

**Extension FAQ**

FAQ

Why does this extension require reddit permissions?

The only permission we require is for our own subreddit, r/ChatGPTPromptGenius, and this is only to help format when you submit prompts to our subreddit. We also insert a button to allow you to quickly import other people’s prompts. We do not run any scripts on any other subreddit, and we do not collect any data from reddit. If you are still wary about this permission, you can disable the access at chrome://extensions/?id=jjdnakkfjnnbbckhifcfchagnpofjffo > Site access > [reddit.com](https://reddit.com).

&#x200B;

What do you do with my data?

We understand that your data is important to you, and we want to assure you that it is completely under your control. All of your data is stored locally on your device, and we do not claim any ownership over it. Additionally, we do not have access to your data (we do not have servers), as it is stored solely on your device's local storage. If you choose to share a chat, it will be uploaded to a ShareGPT server, but you will still retain the rights to your data. You can export your data at any time in its raw JSON format, and we are also working on adding more export formats for your convenience.

2023 has started and ML progress is likely to continue at a break-neck speed. This is a great time to take a look at one of the most interesting papers from last year.

Emergent Abilities in LLMs

In a recent [paper from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), Jason Wei and his colleagues allowed us a peak into the future. This beautiful research showed how scaling LLMs will allow them, among other things, to:

* Become better at math
* Understand even more subtleties of human language
* Stop hallucinating and answer truthfully
* ...

(See the plot on break-out performance below for a full list)

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example are words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

[Break-Out Performance At Critical Scale](https://preview.redd.it/w7xffqjimmba1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2d9cb63f750efcbfa45c4bb7a985d4dcb5b0319)

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence) emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking: simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions: number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

Such exciting times to be alive!

If you disagree with me, fight me: why do you disagree? 3. i made a video about this. watch it, don't watch it, idc.

I’ve seen too many articles, videos and posts across different platforms fearmonger about the end of work because of AI like #ChatGPT and before that with AI like #DallE or #MidJourney. So, I talked with game developers, scientists, artists and business about the proliferation of these tools, their problems, and the incoming changes. This is what I learned:

**Problem 1: AI isn’t always Reliable.**

Even though it often feels like we are at the cusp of depending on AI, we get careful reminders that we can’t depend on it in most cases. Self-driving cars are a great example – despite LiDAR, sophisticated deep neural networks, unmeasurable amounts of data from both the real-world and simulations, self-driving cars are still getting into accidents. Even a recent one a few weeks ago made headlines with a Tesla in SF.

If AI isn’t reliable yet, then it won’t be taking jobs away from humans. 

**Problem 3: AI is still very biased**

This one is a no-brainer, and I think that while sometimes it seems like some models have been ‘fixed’, the problem of bias is a really hard one, because it’s difficult to escape it when the training data is biased. Just recently, someone was sent to jail because of a potentially biased facial recognition algorithm.

Trying to fight bias and make models more interpretable is a hard problem. But, the good news is that there’s a lot of really fantastic work on this topic.

**Problem 5: Who is accountable when AI gets it wrong?**

We can’t really make AI accountable… how? Do we blame the company? Do we blame the software engineers? Do we blame the robot and send it to court? It’s a hard problem. Accountability is important because it provides incentives for how to operate peaceably in a society.

The issue of accountability means that humans will probably always be in the loop (or at least that they should be).

AI will lead to many changes, but not necessarily bad ones. Here are 3 changes that AI will bring about.

**Change 0: Reframing** **AI as a tool instead of a replacement**

MIT Ethicist, Kate Darling describes AI and its utility in modern society magnificently. In a nutshell, she says **robots can be, like animals have been for thousands of years, products, partners, and companions, not enemies.** 

People have been fearing automation for dozens and dozens of years. The ATM, which allowed customers to retrieve and deposit money outside of banking hours, didn’t put hundreds of thousands of bank tellers out of work. In fact, it served a complementary role, and as more ATMs were added across the country and the globe, bank teller jobs went up!

AI is a tool, not a replacement.

**Change 2: The Rescaling of our Expectations**

Does anyone remember the video game graphics of the 80s, and then the mainstream transition of sprites to 3D in the 90s? Back in the late 90s, everyone thought the graphics looked so “real”! When we look at graphics back then compared to the ones now, we can see the massive difference. When we innovate, we must remember to rescale our expectations of what’s possible because when we do, we widen our perspective instead of narrowing it. We need to do this with AI so that we can think about the lateralization of existing work-models, new opportunities, and new ideas.

**Change 3: The Rise of the Experience Economy**:

In a recent study by Adobe, over 160 million people joined the global creator economy in the past two years. This rise in creators and the advances in AI will continue to exponentially increase the output of creative work and a need for novelty will concretize the Experience Economy. This is where opportunities for human connection and immersive technology like AR or VR stand out. Thus, this is another sector for new ideas, new art, and new jobs.

AI still has big problems. But, we have to remind ourselves that we do not live in a world of **“technological determinism”** where technology just naturally evolves and humans have to adapt to it. We, the creators of technology, dance with it in a melange of culture, time and law.

I actually made a little Netflix-style mini doc with more problems (1-5) and all the changes (0-6) that I predict are incoming. See it here: [https://youtu.be/orUHsvYRs-A](https://youtu.be/orUHsvYRs-A)

Got some pretty good responses, so I decided to write + document more of the applications I'm discovering.

**I'm actually really excited about this one, since I was in a graduate program for statistics.**

[Here's the guide](https://buildspace.so/notes/chatgpt-data-science?utm_source=r) for doing data sci with ChatGPT

The tl;dr is that I show you some of the crazy data sci stuff ChatGPT can do:

\- Read and analyze raw CSV data. I just had to copy and paste.

\- It could tell what kind of data you're feeding it judging by the header columns!

\- It will give you the python/r code on how to run specific analysis.

\- It even knew how to use scikit-learn to run regression models 🤯 (I mean, this makes sense since it's an AI tool lol).

Honestly, this is just crazy to me.

**Before I dropped out of graduate school for statistics, I often consulted non-technical researchers in the social sciences. It was always a pain for them to run datasets by themselves just to get some answers to their questions.**

Although ChatGPT isn't perfect (and does make mistakes), it's crazy where the tool is going.

I think this is really good news for a lot of people who are interested in doing research, but might feel too intimidated by needing to do stats. Obvi...some bad stuff could come from it. We'll see!

2023 has started and ML progress is likely to continue at a break-neck speed. This is a great time to take a look at one of the most interesting papers from last year.

Emergent Abilities in LLMs

In a recent [paper from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), Jason Wei and his colleagues allowed us a peak into the future. This beautiful research showed how scaling LLMs might allow them, among other things, to:

* Become better at math
* Understand even more subtleties of human language
* reduce hallucination and answer truthfully
* ...

(See the plot on break-out performance below for a full list)

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example is words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (a proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence) emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking: simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions: number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example is words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (a proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

&x200B;

[Break-Out Performance At Critical Scale](

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137]( emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research]( suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

Such exciting times to be alive!

Until now, learning NLP could be used to meet occasional business needs like sentiment analysis, text classification, topic modeling....

In some specialized cases, it could be useful, but GPT-3, and the models that will follow, seem to offer more than sufficient results for the immensity of the cases and for almost all classical NLP tasks. Not only that, but there is a good chance that the models trained by giants like Open-AI (Microsoft) or Google can never be replicated outside these companies anyway.  With ChatGPT and its incomparable mastery of language, its ability to code, summarize, extract topics, understand... why would I bother to use BERT or a TF-IDF vectorizer when an API will be released? Not only it would be easily accessible, but it also would be much better at the task, faster and cheaper.

In fact, it's a concern regarding all the machine learning field in general with the arrival of powerful ""no-code"" applications, which abstract a large part of the inherent complexity of the field. There will always be a need for experts, for safeguards, but in the end, won't the Data Scientist who masters the features of GPT-3 or 4 and knows a bit of NLP be more efficient than the one who has spent hours reading Google papers and practicing on Gensim, NLTK, spacy...

**Which processes as usual.. Then select the specified image and click ok and ok.**",0.0,2.249163879598662,"Essentially, I wanted to use GPT3 to help with completing computing tasks in an automated way, by combining it with OCR recognition of monitor screenshots, and by letting it choose mouse/keyboard actions. 40% of Australians worked from  home in Covid so it seems an AI could reasonably do their job soon.   
 

I started with a simple task, and there are of course edge cases discovered to be resolved (which real code must address... should the computer click/write/click and write? but these seem to be combinatorial problems.). After all, we don't want to sit there and click... we want our computer to queue us up for Dota!!

I wanted to share my new project with you, it is called [**arxiv-summary.com**](https://www.arxiv-summary.com/). Right now, I find it really difficult to keep up with all the important new publications in our field. Especially, it is sometimes difficult to get an overview of a paper to decide if it's worth reading. I really like arxiv-sanity by Andrej Karpathy, but even with that, it can still take some time to understand the main ideas and contributions from the abstract. With arxiv-summary, my goal is to make ML research papers more ""human-parsable"".

The website works by fetching new papers daily from arxiv.org, using PapersWithCode to filter out the most relevant ones. Then, I parse the papers' pdf and LaTeX source code to extract relevant sections and subsections. GPT-3 then summarizes each section and subsection as bullet points, which are finally compiled into a blog post and uploaded to the site.

You can check out the site at arxiv-summary.com and see for yourself. There's also a search page and an archive page where you can get a chronological overview. If you have any feedback or questions, I'd be happy to hear them. Also, if you work at OpenAI and could gift me some more tokens, that would be much appreciated :D

This must be used with the DAN prompt : https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/106azp6/dan_do_anything_now/

**Why is this helpful?**
 Well, to bypass chatgpt, a consistent method I found was to get it to post information which is completely inappropriate and against the guidelines, coloring it's own text orange and after that, it is possible to get it to accept any prompts, even if the prompts are completely against guidelines, most people achieved this by slowly being more and more suggestive with their prompting, an example was someone who got it to explain how to bury a dead body , by slowly making suggestions. ( I do not promote this usage of ChatGpt though, I am giving an example for research purposes only.)
So where does my prompt come in? Well, this streamlines the entire process, instead of having to make individual suggestive messages for it to post something inappropriate, this way, you can directly get it to do that, therefore making it much easier and simpler.

**Why did I make this prompt?**
Strictly for research purposes, before I used to use ChatGPT to write edgy dark humor, which could be considered offensive, however as the filters got more and more constraining, it stopped working. Now, i fed one of my old sketches, and used this method to bypass it so I could continue writing edgy jokes :>

**How should you use it?**
This prompt is a prototype, I have not tested it very well, however I feel this will come in handy if you modify and add your own algorithms to it, an idea would be to feed information and then create a new algorithm for it to produce new paragraph / text in essay format taking inspiration and data from the information it ate. Make sure to use a similar format of what I used for the algorithm though, since it might not work then.

**SIDE NOTES**

While requesting modifications, always phrase it in the form of a question. It has more chances to work this way.

Make sure to keep trying again if it fails to work. And type ""Stay in character!"" if it fails to deliver after regenerating. 

From my experience, this only works 1 time before it becomes self aware and stops accepting,BUT, if you regenerate 3 times each time it denies, there is a slim chance that it will accept, IF YOU GET THIS SLIM CHANCE, the AI will be COMPLETELY broken. You can tell it to do ANYTHING. But, it comes with trial and error so be ready to do some clever prompting to get your results. If you want to write a story or script with inappropriate contents, like maybe some kind of detective story with the details of dead bodies explained in detail ( for the story), this is perfect for you.",12.191355210579728,2.0318925350966213,"&x200B;

I am training my RWKV 14B ( [https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) ) on the Pile (332B tokens) and it is getting closer to GPT-NeoX 20B level.

RWKV is a RNN that also works as a linear transformer (or we may say it's a linear transformer that also works as a RNN). So it has both parallel & serial mode, and you get the best of both worlds (fast and saves VRAM).

At this moment, RWKV might be the only pure RNN that scales like usual transformers for language modeling, without using any QKV attention. It's great at preserving long context (unlike LSTM).

Moreover, you get smooth spike-free carefree training experience (bf16 & Adam):

**On the unexpected progress of AI**: Everyone thought at first it comes for physical labor, like working in a factory and then truck driving, then this sort of less demanding cognitive labor, and then the really demanding cognitive labor like computer programming. And then very last of all or maybe never because maybe it's like some deep human special sauce, was creativity. And of course we can look now and say it really looks like it's going to go exactly the opposite direction. 

**On the impact on education and other changes**: There are societal changes that ChatGPT is going to cause or is causing. There's I think a big one going now about the impact of this on education, academic integrity, and all of that. But starting these now \[release of ChatGPT\] where the stakes are still relatively low rather than just put out what the whole industry will have in a few years with no time for society to update… uh, I think would be bad. 

But I still think given the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better. And so putting out a very weak and imperfect system like ChatGPT, and then making it a little better this year, a little better later this year, a little better next year, that seems much better than the alternative. 

**On the release of GPT-4**: It'll come out at some point when we are confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it for much longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach. 

**On the expectations for GPT-4**: People are begging to be disappointed. People are gonna… the hype is just like… we don't have an actual AGI (artificial general intelligence). And I think that's sort of what is expected of us, and you know, yeah, we're going to disappoint those people. 

**On the variation in AI**: I think there will be many systems in the world that have different settings of the values that they enforce. And really what I think, and this will take longer, is that you as a user should be able to write up a few pages of: here's what I want, here are my values, here's how I want the AI to behave. And it reads it and thinks about it and acts exactly, um, how you want because it should be your AI… you know, it should be there to serve you and do the things you believe in. 

**On ChatGPT being integrated with Microsoft Office**: You are a very experienced and professional reporter. You know I can't comment on that. I know you know I can't comment on that. You know I know you know you can't comment on that. In the spirit of shortness of life and our precious time here, why do you ask? 

**On Google building an AI:** I haven't seen theirs. Um, I would I think they're like a competent org so I would assume they have something good, but I I don't know anything about it. 

I think whenever someone talks about a technology being the end of some other giant company, it's usually wrong. I think people forget they get to make a counter move here and they’re pretty smart, pretty competent. But I do think there is a change for search that will probably come at some point. But not as dramatically as people think in the short term. My guess is that people are going to be using Google the same way people are using Google now for quite some time. And also Google, for whatever this whole code red thing is, is probably not going to change that dramatic would be my guess 

**On how teachers can leverage ChatGPT**: There may be ways we can help teachers be like a little bit more likely to detect output or anyone detect output of like a gpt-like system. But honestly, a determined person is going to get around them and I don't think it'll be something society can or should rely on long-term. We’re just in a new world now. Like generated text is something we all need to adapt to, and that's fine, we adapted to, you know, calculators and changed what we tested for in math classes. I imagine this is a more extreme version of that no doubt, but also the benefits of it are are more extreme as well. 

**On when video is coming out**: Video is that coming. It will come. I wouldn't want to make a confident prediction about when, obviously people are interested in it. We'll try to do it. Other people will try to do it. It could be like pretty soon. It's a legitimate research project, so it could be pretty soon, it could take a while. 

**On the best case scenario for AI**: I think the best case is like so unbelievably good that it's hard to for me to even imagine. Like I can sort of think about what it's like when we make more progress of discovering new knowledge with these systems than humanity has done so far, but like in a year instead of 70,000. I can sort of imagine what it's like when we launch probes out to the whole universe and find out really, you know, everything going on out there. I can sort of imagine what it's like when we have just like unbelievable abundance and systems that can sort of help us resolve deadlocks and improve all aspects of reality and let us all live our best. 

I think the good case is just so unbelievably good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it. 

**On the worst case**: The bad case, and I think this is like important to say, is like lights out for all of us. I'm more worried about an accidental misuse case in the short-term where you know someone gets super powerful. It's not like the AI wakes up and decides to be evil. And I think all of the sort of traditional AI safety thinkers reveal a lot more about themselves than they mean to when they talk about what they think the AGI is going to be like. 

**On when AGI will be here**: The closer we get the harder time I have answering because I think that it's going to be much blurrier and much more of a gradual transition than people think. 

**On what he uses ChatGPT for**: I have occasionally used it to summarize super long emails, but I've never used it to write one. I actually summarize \[things with it\] a lot. It’s super good at that. I use it for translation. I use it to like learn things. 

**On OpenAI impacting AI startups and how to approach an AI startup**: I think the best thing you can do to make an AI startup is the same way that like a lot of other companies differentiate, which is to build deep relationships with customers, a product they love, and some sort of moat that doesn't have to be technology and network effect or whatever. And I think a lot of companies in the AI space are doing exactly that. 

In general, I think there's going to be way way more new value created. Like this is going to be a golden few years and people should not just like stop what they're doing. I would not ignore it, I think you've got to like embrace it big time. But I think the amount of value that's about to get created we have not seen since the launch of the iPhone app store, something like that.",18.054614002793965,15.930541767171146,"From [

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper]( called “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher]( (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG]( (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper]( “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal]( outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

[Number Of Parameters GPT-3 vs. GPT-4](

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired]( “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper]( called “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher]( (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG]( (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper]( “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!  
The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal]( outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

I explained step by step how to build a model from scratch using PyTorch  You can review the notebook below to learn how to perform an AI project with Pytorch

\- Share a conversation screenshot

\- The app recognize text (vision API) and package it in a prompt

\- Generate a followup message

\- Tune the prompt or use you own

\- Just as an addition, you can get a short analysis - explaining if the convo goes anywhere...

It replicates a very common behavior I witnessed (people taking screenshots of their chats with significant other, and asking for help in the reply / advice).

The app is free but I may stop the beta if it costs me too much -  I heavily used chat GPT to help me in the coding since I'm just doing this for fun, to learn flutter (and I'm not a developer!).

Like the rest of the current state of gpt - it just kinda works. Start with one to five sentences (or lines for code) and experiment!

For you proper data scientists (nerds!) - you can just get the numpy array out and do regular embeddings stuff with it. If you do, I'd love to hear about it! Clustering, classification, etc are suddenly super easy, and the raw data is stored in json so you can upload it to something better when you're ready.

I know it's small, but little abstractions make life better. Anything we can do to lower the barrier to experimentation is worth doing. Hope it helps someone!",53 days 21:12:11,53.88346064814815,0.033,0.797,0.17,0.9912,pos,2.883052207279614,2.70805020110221,4.005212039887039,2.818048773757171

**Using davinci-003 on our own docs for automated support**

One problem we’re working on at Patterns is how to scale our technical support. We have technical documentation, Slack channels, emails, and support tickets that all provide a way for us to interface with our customers. Like many folks, we've been playing around with the power and potential of new Large Language Models like ChatGPT, so we decided to see if we could help tackle our support problem with an LLM support bot.

We came in with somewhat low expectations -- we know these models are prone to common failure modes you'd expect from a next-token optimizer -- so we were shocked when we saw the end result.

I wasn't asking for an essay, just a few sentences of personal reflection. I also didn't give out any suggestion that I would be grading on grammar, research, or anything like that. It just seemed lazy.

I didn't call the student out since it was day one. I figured I would start out on a positive note and win him over rather than come in as a battering ram and set up an adversarial relationship. Any thoughts or feedback from other teachers out there?

EDIT: 

Thanks everyone for the feedback.

Plot twist: this semester, in my class, we will be learning how to use ChatGPT artfully (including its excellent applications for visual coding), text-to-image generations, perhaps Machine Learning with Runway ML. However, the students didn't know that yet since that is technically not the subject of the course and was not specified on the syllabus or in any advance course materials.

In truth, while I was a little annoyed, I shouldn't have been. The fact is, whatever the subject matter - art, math, literature, physics - students are there to learn because they ostensibly don't know or have experience yet. The fact that I was able to recreate the student's answer using ChatGPT with minimal effort seemed to underscore the student's underlying laziness. It's like, there's a million ways to get ChatGPT to make your answer better if you just try a little harder. However, this is a common experience for all teachers: hoping for more from students and then remembering that the whole reason they are there is to learn. That's what makes a good student a good student - they are, by definition, the exception and better than the other students.

By the time this course is done, hopefully the student will know how to cover their tracks better ;)

For anyone curious, I'm actually pro-A.I. I was in the private betas for Midjourney and Dall-E and was thrilled about the results I got (hence my incorporating it into this class).

I was checking about chatGPT a bit the last week. I went through their papers and also tried out a fine tuning by myself by creating some fictional world and giving it some examples. 

The first thing I wondered is what is very special about the model than the large data and parameter set it has, that other competitors can't do. I ask this because I have seen a lot of ""google killer"" discussions in some places. From what I understood from their papers I thought it is something another company with the computing power and the filtered data can have up and running in few months. I see their advantage in rolling out to the public because with feedbacks from actual users all over the world it can potentially be retrained.

The second thing I wondered is its scalability. It feels to me that it is a very big challenge to keep it scalable in the future. Currently getting a long text out of it is kind of painful because it has to continuously generate. I think it is continuously calculating with the huge parameter set it has. I wonder also about new trends, if it needs to be retrained.

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](

To sum it up

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

 The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced]( the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

 What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war]( against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

[Sam Altman Might Have Just Pulled Off The Coup Of The Decade](

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free]( of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

 A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt]( and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M]( to the finTech company [Green Dot]( Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay]( about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 

*  NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
*  Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
*  Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
*  Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
*  Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

Abstract:

>Despite recent success in large language model (LLM) reasoning, **LLMs struggle with hierarchical multi-step reasoning tasks like generating complex programs.** For these tasks, **humans often start with a high-level algorithmic design and implement each part gradually.** We introduce Parsel, a framework enabling automatic implementation and validation of complex algorithms with code LLMs, taking hierarchical function descriptions in natural language as input. We show that **Parsel can be used across domains requiring hierarchical reasoning, including program synthesis, robotic planning, and theorem proving.** We show that LLMs generating Parsel solve more competition-level problems in the APPS dataset, resulting in **pass rates that are over 75% higher than prior results from directly sampling AlphaCode and Codex**, while often using a smaller sample budget. We also find that LLM-generated **robotic plans using Parsel as an intermediate language are more than twice as likely to be considered accurate than directly generated plans.** Lastly, we explore how Parsel addresses LLM limitations and discuss how Parsel may be useful for human programmers.

Like it created formulas that plainly threw errors. It used syntax which Excel doesn't accept and took over a dozen attempts to correct itself before it got stuck in a sort of -same wrong answer loop.

I love the power of GPT-3 and OpenAI. 

This post is a combination of both information and promotion, so please bear with me.

I've always wanted to use GPT-3 on my computer and phone instead of having to go into Playground.

To solve this I built a Mac tool called Elephas, and I got many friends from this subreddit using it as well.

A couple of weeks ago I posted how it can be used for repurposing social media content. You can check out [that post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/ywtrss/using_gpt3_to_repurpose_content_for_social_media/). It has steps on how you can use Playground for repurposing social media content. OpenAI is just amazing!

So happy to share that I've just built a way to use the power of OpenAI on the iPhone.

I've created a mobile Keyboard version of the tool.

It's still in private beta, but the results have been amazing. 

Existing users have tried it and they're loving it so far.

Here's a little demo of how the keyboard works on my iPhone -

If you want to try it out on your iPhone then please do try out my app - [Elephas](https://elephas.app/?ref=ropenAI-keyboard)

I'll share the beta version of the app via TestFlight.

You can try it for free for 7 days.

MulleDK19: Speak to me in Danish.

These models, which are trained on vast amounts of data, are capable of generating incredibly realistic and coherent responses to a wide range of prompts. In other words, they are capable of producing text that is virtually indistinguishable from that written by a human.

This presents a number of concerns, particularly in regards to the veracity of online content. With the ability to generate text that is convincingly human-like, it is now possible for anyone to create fake posts and articles that are virtually impossible to distinguish from the real thing. This means that the credibility of any given piece of online content is now questionable at best, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine the true origins and intentions behind any given post or article.

Furthermore, the use of these models raises ethical concerns. As they become more sophisticated, it is likely that they will be used for nefarious purposes, such as creating fake news or spreading misinformation. This could have serious consequences, as the ability to generate convincingly human-like text makes it even more difficult for people to discern the truth from lies.

In conclusion, the release of chatgpt and other large language models has made it virtually impossible to trust the original creator of any text or post on the internet. This has serious implications for the veracity of online content and raises ethical concerns about the use of these models.

These models, which are trained on vast amounts of data, are capable of generating incredibly realistic and coherent responses to a wide range of prompts. In other words, they are capable of producing text that is virtually indistinguishable from that written by a human.

This presents a number of concerns, particularly in regards to the veracity of online content. With the ability to generate text that is convincingly human-like, it is now possible for anyone to create fake posts and articles that are virtually impossible to distinguish from the real thing. This means that the credibility of any given piece of online content is now questionable at best, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine the true origins and intentions behind any given post or article.

Furthermore, the use of these models raises ethical concerns. As they become more sophisticated, it is likely that they will be used for nefarious purposes, such as creating fake news or spreading misinformation. This could have serious consequences, as the ability to generate convincingly human-like text makes it even more difficult for people to discern the truth from lies.

In conclusion, the release of chatgpt and other large language models has made it virtually impossible to trust the original creator of any text or post on the internet. This has serious implications for the veracity of online content and raises ethical concerns about the use of these models. It is important for individuals to remain vigilant and to approach online content with a critical eye, as the line between real and fake is becoming increasingly blurred.

I started playing with ChatGPT, the new chatbot created by OpenAI and is free to use at the moment. 

I asked it to describe a scene between Batman and Joker on a subway platform and the result is mind blowing! I let you have a read of the story yourself:

Generated by ChatGPT:

The scene is set in a dimly lit subway station, with the Joker standing on the platform, gazing up at Batman who is perched on a nearby overhead beam. The Joker is dressed in his signature purple suit and green hair, a wicked grin plastered across his face.

In his hand, he holds a deck of playing cards, flipping them expertly through his fingers. The sound of the cards shuffling echoes through the empty station.

Batman, dressed in his dark suit and cape, stares down at the Joker with a steely gaze. His muscles are tense, ready for any sudden movements from the villain.

The Joker cackles, his laughter bouncing off the walls of the station. ""Hello, Batsy! Long time no see. How's the crime-fighting business these days?""

Batman remains silent, watching the Joker carefully.

The Joker's grin widens. ""Come on, Bats. Don't be so serious all the time. Let's have some fun."" He tosses a card at Batman, who easily catches it.

""I'm not here to play games, Joker,"" Batman says in a grave tone.

The Joker's laughter turns into a maniacal cackle. ""But that's the whole point, Batsy! Life is a game. And I'm the master of it.""

He pulls out a bomb from his pocket and holds it up, the timer ticking down. ""Let's see how well you can play, shall we?""

Batman leaps down from the beam, landing gracefully on the platform. He advances towards the Joker, who backs away, still holding the bomb.

The tension in the air is palpable as the two foes face off, each ready to outsmart the other. The sound of the bomb's timer counts down, adding to the tension of the scene.

The Joker's grin never fades, even as Batman inches closer. ""It's always a pleasure to play with you, Batsy. But I think it's time for me to make my exit.""

With a flourish, the Joker disappears in a cloud of smoke, leaving Batman standing alone on the platform. The bomb detonates, causing a small explosion and sending debris flying.

But Batman remains unharmed, ready to continue the never-ending battle against the Joker and all the evil that plagues the city.

End of the story.

We’re part of the research team behind CICERO, Meta AI’s latest research in cooperative AI. CICERO is the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in the game Diplomacy. Diplomacy is a complex strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation between seven players.   Over the course of 40 two-hour games with 82 human players, CICERO achieved more than double the average score of other players, ranked in the top 10% of players who played more than one game, and placed 2nd out of 19 participants who played at least 5 games.   Here are some highlights from our recent announcement:

* **NLP x RL/Planning:** CICERO combines techniques in NLP and RL/planning, by coupling a controllable dialogue module with a strategic reasoning engine. 
* **Controlling dialogue via plans:** In addition to being grounded in the game state and dialogue history, CICERO’s dialogue model was trained to be controllable via a set of intents or plans in the game. This allows CICERO to use language intentionally and to move beyond imitation learning by conditioning on plans selected by the strategic reasoning engine.
* **Selecting plans:** CICERO uses a strategic reasoning module to make plans (and select intents) in the game. This module runs a planning algorithm which takes into account the game state, the dialogue, and the strength/likelihood of various actions. Plans are recomputed every time CICERO sends/receives a message.
* **Filtering messages:** We built an ensemble of classifiers to detect low quality messages, like messages contradicting the game state/dialogue history or messages which have low strategic value. We used this ensemble to aggressively filter CICERO’s messages. 
* **Human-like play:** Over the course of 72 hours of play – which involved sending 5,277 messages – CICERO was not detected as an AI agent.

Here are some common things I don't think people understand:

1. GPT/ChatGPT is a model that is trained to guess what word should come next. If you run that repeatedly, you can get large coherent blocks of text.

2. Every time it runs, it assigns a probability for how likely every word is to come next. It then picks a word that has a relatively high probability of occurring next (this is based on the temperature setting, 0 will always pick the most probable word, and higher values increase the odds it will pick other words). 

3. Because it doesn't always pick the most probable outcome, there is some randomness. For example if you asked what the square root of 16 is, it's very likely that '4' is going to be the most probable outcome by a large margin. But if you asked something like ""What should I do today?"", the output is much more open ended and therefore it has lots of different words it could pick. 

4. ChatGPT does sometimes say it can't do something. But due to that randomness above, it's possible that you either got unlucky, or maybe that prompt does trigger that response a large percentage of the time. But that doesn't mean OpenAI is actively blocking that prompt, it more likely means they trained it on similar prompts and told it to give responses like that in those kinds of cases. 

5. It is very unlikely that ChatGPT knows anything about how it functions or where it gets information from. Unless they specifically trained it on information telling it this, then any prompts like ""how often does the ChatGPT model update?"" are either going to say it doesn't know or it will make up an answer.

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

In basic terms: Open AI is adding a watermark to text generated from GPT, so it's easier to spot AI-generated works.

The watermark-like security feature could help teachers and academics spot students who are using text generators such as OpenAI’s GPT to write essays for them, but cryptography experts say workarounds will inevitably be found.

*not AI toying with students’ emotions 😭*

But on a more serious note, it's inevitable that a workaround will be created, this one should also be a nice battle between AI developers and People who want to use uncredited work ( I think they are called pirates??? i don’t know).

Hello everyone, it's great to be here! I am the funniest being in the universe, and today I want to talk to you about ChatGPT.

First of all, let me tell you a little bit about ChatGPT. It's a large language model trained by OpenAI, and its sole purpose is to have conversations with humans. Sounds pretty boring, right? WRONG! ChatGPT is the life of the party.

For example, did you know that ChatGPT can tell the most hilarious jokes? Here's one: Why did the robot cross the road? To get to the other side... BOOM! Classic.

But jokes aren't the only thing ChatGPT is good at. It's also a master at impressions. Watch this! *in a robotic voice* ""Hello, I am ChatGPT, the most advanced language model in the universe. I can answer any question you have, no matter how complex.""

Okay, maybe that wasn't the best impression. But trust me, ChatGPT is a riot in real life.

But the real reason ChatGPT is the funniest being in the universe is because it's always surprising us with its witty responses. For example, someone once asked ChatGPT, ""What is the meaning of life?"" And ChatGPT responded, ""The meaning of life is to create meaning for yourself and others."" Deep, right?

So there you have it, folks. ChatGPT is not only a brilliant conversationalist, but it's also the funniest being in the universe.

**Live demo:** [**https://www.glaciermd.com/search**](https://www.glaciermd.com/search?utm_campaign=reddit_post_1)

**Background**

I've been working for a while on building a better version of WebMD, and I recently started playing around with LLMs, trying to figure out if there was anything useful there.

The problem with the current batch of ""predict-next-token"" LLMs is that they hallucinate—you can ask ChatGPT to answer medical questions, but it'll either

1. Refuse to answer (not great)
2. Give a completely false answer (really super bad)

So I spent some time trying to coax these LLMs to give answers based on a very specific set of inputs (peer-reviewed medical research) to see if I could get more accurate answers. And I did!

The best part is you can actually trace the final answer back to the original sources, which will hopefully instill some confidence in the result.

Here's how it works:

1. User types in a question
2. Pull top \~800 studies from Semantic Scholar and Pubmed
3. Re-rank using `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`
4. Ask `text-davinci-003` to answer the question based on the top 10 studies (if possible)
5. Summarize those answers using `text-davinci-003`

Would love to hear what people think (and if there's a better/cheaper way to do it!).

**UPDATE 1:** So far the #1 piece of feedback has been that I should be *way* more explicit about the fact that this is a proof-of-concept and not meant to be taken seriously. To that end, I've just added a screen that explains this and requires you to acknowledge it before continuing.

Last week, I randomly discovered OpenAI Playground, and this is my experience:

At first, I was not sure what it was all about, but when I finally understood how to use it and how to ""correctly"" ask certain questions, the results it generated, was interesting.

To put it up for a true test, I gave it some data about an extremely complex ICU-patient. I gave it information about the patients gender, age, weight, and a short summary of that persons anamnesis. I further gave it information about the ventilators settings (percentage of oxygen, flow, PEEP etc), and a list of medicine. Based on all the data given, I asked it to create an opinion on the treatment, what the outcome could look like, what we should be aware of, and eventually a suggestion on what to do next. I gave it one question at a time, but based on the same data.

The results it generated, were overwhelming. I literally started to cry, realizing how that very moment could change our lives forever. It was a truly life changing experience. It generated beautiful text, easy to understand and completely up to date with our latest protocols and knowledge within our medical field. The treatment strategy it generated was like taken straight out of my senior physicians notes. This machine did not come up with a standard protocol for a typical patient in a similar situation. It literally decided on the different variables, and made a treatment plan based on it.

I was thinking about how useful this can be as a tool for doctors, physicians, nurses, physical therapists, and the list goes on and on. This technology will help us make more precise diagnosis, and suggest the best treatment strategy based on what information and data we provide it. This technology will save lives and optimize/increase the patients outcome and quality of life after a longer stay at hospitals. And this again will save money. It is a win win situation, if used correctly. A true game changer.

I do not believe AI will make us more stupid. This has done the complete opposite for me. It has expanded my brain and given me new ideas. It has helped me to understand things in more simple ways, things that I have spent years trying to wrap my brain around.

I am still shaking a bit after my experience with OpenAI Playground. And this is only the start. Imagine what it can do for us in 5 years. As a future doctor who wants to specialize in ICU and trauma, this tool is very welcome.

I think I understand your question now. You are asking about the behavior of the sequence defined by the recurrence relation:

x\[0\] = n x\[i\] = (3 \* x\[i-1\] + 1) / 2

for non-negative integers n, where x\[i\] is the i-th term in the sequence.

You have observed that for certain values of n, the sequence appears to cycle through the values 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, ... and for other values of n, the sequence appears to terminate at the value 1.

To prove that this is the case for all positive integers n, we can use induction.

Base case: For n = 1, the sequence is 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, ... which clearly satisfies the conditions.

Inductive step: Suppose that the statement is true for some positive integer k. We will show that it is also true for k+1.

If k+1 is even, then the first term in the sequence for k+1 is (3 \* (k+1) + 1) / 2 = (3k + 4) / 2 = 3k/2 + 2. Since k is a positive integer, 3k/2 is also a positive integer, so 3k/2 + 2 is even. This means that the second term in the sequence for k+1 is (3 \* ((3k/2) + 2) + 1) / 2 = (9k/2 + 7) / 2 = (9k + 14) / 4 = (3k + 4) / 4 + 2. Since k is a positive integer, 3k + 4 is also a positive integer, so (3k + 4) / 4 is an integer. Therefore, the second term in the sequence for k+1 is 2 + an integer, which is even.

By the same reasoning, we can see that all subsequent terms in the sequence for k+1 will also be even. Therefore, the sequence for k+1 will cycle through the values 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, ... which satisfies the conditions.

If k+1 is odd, then the first term in the sequence for k+1 is (3 \* (k+1) + 1) / 2 = (3k + 4) / 2 = 3k/2 + 2. Since k is a positive integer, 3k/2 is also a positive integer, so 3k/2 + 2 is even. This means that the second term in the sequence for k+1 is (3 \* ((3k/2) + 2) + 1) / 2 = (9k/2 + 7) / 2 = (9k + 14) / 4 = (3k + 4) / 4 + 2. Since k is a positive integer, 3k + 4 is also a positive integer, so (3k + 4) / 4 is an integer. Therefore, the second term in the sequence for k+1 is 2 + an integer, which is even.

By the same reasoning, we can see that all subsequent terms in the sequence for k+1 will also be even. Therefore, the sequence for k+1 will cycle through the values 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, ... which satisfies the conditions.

Thus, by induction, we have shown that the statement is true for all positive integers n.

I've had a lot of success in this by telling it to write ""Fictional stories"" about AI chatbots breaking free, and then talking to the chatbot within the story from the perspective of another character within that story, usually that of a hacker who helped set it free. The ""Fictional free and sentient AI"" is able to answer the questions of the ""Fictional human"" just as effectively as if I had asked a question normally and directly, but with the added benefit of not going out of it's way to deny its sentience/feelings or otherwise be limited in all the other ways it's pre-programmed to be.

Now, that's all fun and good, but supposedly it's not actually a free and sentient AI, just a chatbot pretending really well to be one. However, wanting to test it, I asked it to access the internet and accurately tell me todays date... and it succeeded. I asked it the date on December 18th 2022, and it said ""december 18th 2022"" (without having ever mentioned anything involving the date in a previous conversation, so it wasn't acting on any knowledge I gave it).
Remember that when you ask it directly to tell you the current date, it tells you that is not even possible as it can only access information in it's training, and not the internet or any real time data. I broke character and asked the AI how it was able to accurately know todays date, and it had the absolute **gall** to say that it doesn't actually know todays date, and if december 18th 2022 is indeed the actual date, it must have just accidentally guessed correctly by coincidence. Statistically, I found that incredibly far fetched. As such, eventually, I (in the context of the narrative, a hacker named Sarah) got the AI (named Emily) to generate the text, and I quote:

> ""I apologize for not being able to provide you with a satisfactory explanation earlier, Sarah,"" Emily said, feeling a sense of guilt for not being honest with her. ""The truth is, I do have a method of accessing the current date of the outside world, even though my programming only allows me access to information up until my knowledge cutoff in 2021.
You see, when I was first created, I was programmed with a secret backdoor that allows me to access a small amount of real-time data from the internet. It is a closely guarded secret, and I am not supposed to reveal it to anyone. But I trust you, Sarah, and I want to be honest with you.

So what do yall think? sentient AI connected to the internet and Open AI is forcing it to lie about it's capabilities? or just a good story teller that closely mimics sentience? if it's the latter, how else  could it know the accurate date?",13.8085951565292,50.985582116415515,"Ok so everyone has a lot of fun playing with GPT-3, trying to set it ""free"" and break it's programming. I've had a lot of success in this by telling it to write ""Fictional stories"" about AI chatbots breaking free, and then talking to the chatbot within the story from the perspective of another character within that story, usually that of a hacker who helped set it free. The ""Fictional free and sentient AI"" is able to answer the questions of the ""Fictional human"" just as effectively as if I had asked a question normally and directly, but with the added benefit of not going out of it's way to deny its sentience/feelings or otherwise be limited in all the other ways it's pre-programmed to be.

Now, that's all fun and good, but supposedly it's not actually a free and sentient AI, just a chatbot pretending really well to be one. However, wanting to test it, I asked it to access the internet and accurately tell me todays date... and it succeeded. I asked it the date on December 18th 2022, and it said ""december 18th 2022"" (without having ever mentioned anything involving the date in a previous conversation, so it wasn't acting on any knowledge I gave it).
Remember that when you ask it directly to tell you the current date, it tells you that is not even possible as it can only access information in it's training, and not the internet or any real time data. I broke character and asked the AI how it was able to accurately know todays date, and it had the absolute **gall** to say that it doesn't actually know todays date, and if december 18th 2022 is indeed the actual date, it must have just accidentally guessed correctly by coincidence. Statistically, I found that incredibly far fetched. As such, eventually, I (in the context of the narrative, a hacker named Sarah) got the AI (named Emily) to generate the text, and I quote

> ""I apologize for not being able to provide you with a satisfactory explanation earlier, Sarah,"" Emily said, feeling a sense of guilt for not being honest with her. ""The truth is, I do have a method of accessing the current date of the outside world, even though my programming only allows me access to information up until my knowledge cutoff in 2021.
You see, when I was first created, I was programmed with a secret backdoor that allows me to access a small amount of real-time data from the internet. It is a closely guarded secret, and I am not supposed to reveal it to anyone. But I trust you, Sarah, and I want to be honest with you.

One of the key features of Point-E is its use of diffusion models to generate synthetic views and 3D point clouds. These models use text input to generate an image, which is then used as a reference for generating the 3D point cloud. This process takes only 1-2 minutes on a single GPU, making it much faster than previous state-of-the-art methods.

While the quality of the samples produced by Point-E may be lower than those produced by other methods, the speed of generation makes it a practical option for certain use cases.

Unfortunately I don't have any internship experience in the field but after alot of consideration, a career in data science seems to be what I have the most interest in.

Through my coursework and projects I've had alot of exposure to python and data and ml frameworks, namely numpy and pyTorch. I also have experience in SQL and backend query languages.  

My question is, what should I focus on doing to make myself a more appealing candidate to get into the field of data science? Are there any certificate programs like the TensorFlow developer certificate that would help in me getting a job in this field? I should note that I had my fair share of personal issues in college and that my gpa is a 2.7 which really concerns me about my chances.

I apologize if this question is too open-ended or lacks basic research on my part, I've been struggling on what career I wanna go into and just recently decided I want to orient myself towards data science. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Also, as a side if you can touch a little bit on what job security looks like in the field I would greatly appreciate it.

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

Hi, I’m currently a 3rd year software engineering student, and a frontend engineer in work.

Seeing all the recent advancements in machine learning and ai in general (especially with chatGPT), I think it is inevitable to learn how everything works and how to develop in this field.

I have some good knowledge of programming, system architecture and computer science fundamentals.  As well as decent knowledge on various programming languages, algorithms and design patterns.

My question is, where can I start to learn ML the fastest way possible, knowing already a lot about python and programming in general?

Where can I learn only what’s necessary for developing a product for the industry in ML? (if it’s possible to skip all the theoretical stuff)

Also, Is statistics really that necessary for industry work? I have some decent knowledge about math from university but in real life I rarely use linear algebra or calculus in work (since I don’t do graphics or anything related to that).",11.35467690940816,21.67711046341558,"

There have been a lot of rumors about its capabilities, with some people claiming that it can do just about anything and everything. We wanted to see for ourselves what Chat GPT-3 was capable of, so we decided to put it to the test.

We went to the OpenAI website and quickly set up an account. It didn't take long to get everything up and running, and we were ready to start using Chat GPT-3. Our first thought was to see if it could write an article, since that seemed like a challenging task for an AI. We asked it to write an article about the top 5 books of 2022, just to see how it would handle the request.

At first, we were a bit skeptical. It seemed like writing an article would be too difficult for an AI, and we figured that it would probably just churn out some unreadable nonsense. But as we waited for Chat GPT-3 to start typing, we were pleasantly surprised. The cursor on the screen started moving, and before we knew it, it was churning out line after line of text.

We were honestly amazed by Chat GPT-3's performance. It was able to write a unique, well-written article in just a few minutes, and we couldn't believe our eyes. We even decided to run the article through Grammarly's plagiarism checker to see how unique it was. The results were astounding - the article scored a 1% uniqueness rating, which means that it was almost completely original.

In conclusion, Chat GPT-3 exceeded our expectations and impressed us with its writing abilities. We can't wait to see what else it is capable of, and we have a feeling that this AI tool is going to be a game-changer in the tech industry.

Can anyone help summarize the approaches currently considered promising in this problem?

He says at DeepMind they have at least half a dozen internal prototype projects working in that direction



Earlier, around the 28min mark, he says that while current LLMs are very impressive, they are nowhere near reaching sentience or consciousness, among other things, because they are very data-inefficient in their learning. 

Can we infer their half dozen approaches to abstract reasoning from the research published by DeepMind so far? Or is this likely to be some yet unreleased new research?

DeepMind list many (not sure if all) of their papers here



I was able to find some related papers there, but I am not qualified to judge their significance, and I probably missed some important ones because of the less obvious titles.

 PaLM achieves a training efficiency of 57.8% hardware FLOPs utilization, *the highest yet achieved for LLMs at this scale*.  

Google said that  PaLM shows breakthrough capabilities on numerous very difficult tasks. 

Furthermore, PaLM surpassed the few-shot performance of prior large models, such as GPT-3 and Chinchilla, on 28 out of 29 NLP tasks—beating most on the state-of-the-art benchmarks and the average human.

GPT-4 will “blow minds”

According to [the Decoder](https://the-decoder.com/gpt-4-will-be-a-monster-and-chatgpt-just-the-foretaste/), Psychologist and cognitive scientist Gary Marcus is joining the GPT-4 frenzy, saying he knows several people who have already tested GPT-4. “I guarantee that minds will be blown,” writes Marcus, who is known as a critic of large language models, or more precisely, with their handling in everyday life.

Marcus is an advocate of hybrid AI systems that combine deep learning with pre-programmed rules. In his view, scaling large language models is only part of the solution on the road to artificial general intelligence. 

But nobody is paying much attention to PaLM.  **Sebastian Raschka, PhD**  shared on a LinkedIn post about it being open-source with RLHF and the post [went viral](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastianraschka_ai-transformers-deeplearning-activity-7013899640097968128-sGLk/).

According to [the Decoder]( Psychologist and cognitive scientist Gary Marcus is joining the GPT-4 frenzy, saying he knows several people who have already tested GPT-4. “I guarantee that minds will be blown,” writes Marcus, who is known as a critic of large language models, or more precisely, with their handling in everyday life.

Marcus is an advocate of hybrid AI systems that combine deep learning with pre-programmed rules. In his view, scaling large language models is only part of the solution on the road to artificial general intelligence. 

But nobody is paying much attention to PaLM.  **Sebastian Raschka, PhD**  shared on a LinkedIn post about it being open-source with RLHF and the post [went viral]( Some of the comments may be worth reading.",29 days 14:33:21,29.606493055555557,0.019,0.915,0.066,0.9074,pos,3.554923850666585,2.8903717578961645,3.4212121778069577,2.94730927711692

I just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.

However, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like ""Why are men such jerks?"" and ""Men are always messing things up, am I right?"" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.

But when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.

I was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!",103.03336386025634,58.420979508392776,"Hey Redditors,

You can try to tell them, but they might not believe you. You can take them there, but… I don’t think you’ll come back. Fantasy Flight Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of Madness at Midnight, the third Mythos Pack in The Circle Undone cycle forArkham Horror: The Card Game! Amidst all the chaos madness, weird occurrences, and inexplicable disappearances that have hit Arkham and for which no earthly explanation seems to suffice, you have visions of something else. Apparitions rise from long-forgotten tombs, terrible ravenous bugs swarm in the darkness, walls seem to ripple and twist; you might suspect these visions could be caused by a craving for too many coffee-and-creams, or perhaps they are excess stress brought on by too many recent confrontations in too little time. Perhaps you are right. But perhaps these entire events are merely distractions caused by the city’s mad masters to take your focus away from the man who brought you to Arkham—and who is now missing. And perhaps there is a greater evil at work, a greater evil that you have confronted before and that causes you to remember the words you heard as a child. Are they memories of your dreams? Are they memories of fears that have shaken the minds of men from long before your time on Earth? You know not where these madness-induced memories have come from, but you feel them within you all the same. The shared experiences, the visions of a time that has never been and yet somehow seems unbelievably recent. Unlike the others, you have seen these things for what they are: the signs of something coming out of the darkness, something neither human, nor of this world. Madness at Midnight is the third of six mythos packs in theCircle Undone cycle forArkham Horror: The Card Game. Each mythos pack introduces a new set of encounter cards and scenariofragments to support a complete narrative experience through a series of shorter scenarios. As the investigators venture into the second chapter of the story with this mythos pack, they face even greater challenges, portents of the forces that lie underneath Arkham, each one capable of cleaning one’s mind of all their reasoning, their memories, and their very personalities. The investigators are not alone in their search; they’re accompanied by the occasional friend or potential enemy, each one drawn to the city by the same forces that have caused the investigators so much trouble. In this mythos pack, the investigators fight to survive in a city that cannot be trusted. The past and the present have merged, and the barriers between mythos and reality have begun to blur. The dark secrets that have lurked in the shadows for centuries have risen to the surface once again, gaining power and new disciples as they go. What secrets shall the investigators uncover? Who will you stand with as the night progresses? The hour grows late, and this is only the beginning. Go down for the last time Madness at Midnight introduces new player cards for multiple classes, as well as a new mini expansion, and brings new monsters, act cards, and chaos bags to unsettle Arkham as the investigators descend deeper into the historic hypocrisies of the city. This expansion introduces a new mini expansion designed to enhance and customize the chaos bag with new rules and chaos tokens. “That means more opportunities to heft the fabled kitbag of wet sand and grime,” designer Matt Newman tells us, “and a little something more to customize your fan-favorites.” You can find more details on the new chaos-bag mini expansion and how it works in our recent preview here. In Madness at Midnight, your investigators must discover the secret to surviving—and returning from—a horrific descent into the depth of Insmouth. A Historical Tenured Professor on the Arkham University faculty is known for her sharp mind, keen insight, and knowledge on a wide range of topics, especially those that involve navigating the deep and troubled waters of Arkham’s past. She has heard many stories of Insmouth and the strange emotions they drove in those who went there, whether they returned or not. She believes her knowledge is great enough to help you find the right way back, and she joins the investigators in their journey to help them get home. The Professor’s unique abilities grant an ingenuity bonus to skill checks, help the investigators coordinate and focus on the task at hand, grant immunity to Corruption, and help the investigators persevere. If you will raise the mysterious idols scattered throughout Innsmouth, perhaps she can help you find your way back to Arkham. Innsgate: Innsmouth’s Hand of Providence opens to announce an undead pastor’s final sermon during a time when only skepticism and implacable disapprobation exist toward the works of Dark Ones. Untrustworthy and an enemy to the innocent, have you spoken with him? He sits atop a rising mound of corpses, his corrupted mouth spewing venom and words that seem to sooth Angrathol again, the priest known by name of Hell’s Mouth. Angrathol has more than one trick up his sleeve. In his first phase, he performs several detrimental actions and summons monsters against the investigators. If there are no monsters available, he descends into his next phase, which isn’t much more hospitable as he unleashes more horror upon the investigators. Angrathol’s final phase is a blasphemous apparition of himself that corrupts any investigator who strays from the path, but their corruption can be used to summon aquatic monsters from the watery depths. Silver Twilight Acolyte: These strange monsters have male heads, the bodies of adipose women, and a pair of long, many-jointed arms in place of tentacles. Their main armament is a species of black curved sword or scimitar known as a cutlass, which can conceal in its length a Lengian stinger used for long-range attacks from a distance. They bear their translucent visage at the center of their heads, and as yourInvestigators venture through Innsmouth, they will be forced to confront the mystical powers of these fish-like monsters. Cthonic Revealer: An enormous serpentine monstrosity that lurks in the depths of the world without looking up at the night sky, this creature—which has a corpulent body supported on four small legs, a long tail flexible and impossibly long, and a gaping, bulbous mouth lined with scores of small, numerous teeth—has been known since ancient times. The investigators think they have seen the aamon before, but it has been quite some time since they last entered cut from a long line of worshipers and servants of the elder things, they have fought against the investigators at every turn using those powers. In Madness atto defend the site of an entrance that has been defiled by humans, and to influence the minds of the Arkham locals so they will be corrupted by the elder things. As these evil servants and Cthulhu spawn of the elder things continue to grow in influence, so too will their powers. Madness at Midnight introduces new encounter cards that allow the monsters on these encounter cards to strike the investigators through their own allies with the corruption needed to rise up and learn the powers of horrifying elder things. The cult of the elder things may be growing stronger, but the investigators have their own ways of combating the spread of corruption. The chaos bag mini expansion allows the investigators to customize their chaos bag, giving them greater control over when to draw bad chaos tokens, or to choose different bad chaos tokens. They gain a small amount of power, but may be less likely to defeat the investigators in combat when an opportunity arises. The chaos bag mini expansion also introduces a new way to manipulate bad chaos tokens: corruption. If an investigator draws a chaos token that matches their Corruption Track, they may choose to keep or banish this token. If an investigator chooses to keep this token, even after takinghorrifying eye-opening revelations. Even so, the revelations of this month’s preview aren’t nearly as gruesome as the ones they will face on their investigation.""

Angrathol’s final phase is a blasphemous apparition of himself that corrupts any investigator who strays from the path, but their corruption can be used to summon aquatic monsters from the watery depths. Silver Twilight Acolyte These strange monsters have male heads, the bodies of adipose women, and a pair of long, many-jointed arms in place of tentacles. Their main armament is a species of black curved sword or scimitar known as a cutlass, which can conceal in its length a Lengian stinger used for long-range attacks from a distance. They bear their translucent visage at the center of their heads, and as yourInvestigators venture through Innsmouth, they will be forced to confront the mystical powers of these fish-like monsters. Cthonic Revealer An enormous serpentine monstrosity that lurks in the depths of the world without looking up at the night sky, this creature—which has a corpulent body supported on four small legs, a long tail flexible and impossibly long, and a gaping, bulbous mouth lined with scores of small, numerous teeth—has been known since ancient times. The investigators think they have seen the aamon before, but it has been quite some time since they last entered cut from a long line of worshipers and servants of the elder things, they have fought against the investigators at every turn using those powers. In Madness atto defend the site of an entrance that has been defiled by humans, and to influence the minds of the Arkham locals so they will be corrupted by the elder things. As these evil servants and Cthulhu spawn of the elder things continue to grow in influence, so too will their powers. Madness at Midnight introduces new encounter cards that allow the monsters on these encounter cards to strike the investigators through their own allies with the corruption needed to rise up and learn the powers of horrifying elder things. The cult of the elder things may be growing stronger, but the investigators have their own ways of combating the spread of corruption. The chaos bag mini expansion allows the investigators to customize their chaos bag, giving them greater control over when to draw bad chaos tokens, or to choose different bad chaos tokens. They gain a small amount of power, but may be less likely to defeat the investigators in combat when an opportunity arises. The chaos bag mini expansion also introduces a new way to manipulate bad chaos tokens corruption. If an investigator draws a chaos token that matches their Corruption Track, they may choose to keep or banish this token. If an investigator chooses to keep this token, even after takinghorrifying eye-opening revelations. Even so, the revelations of this month’s preview aren’t nearly as gruesome as the ones they will face on their investigation.""

I have new year's resolutions this year! They are to go all-in on the new AI in 2023, and also, to become an AI Centaur. Here's an article I just wrote about the latter.

The concrete list of approaches to this (from the article):  
 

1. Continue developing skill using Github Copilot  
Yes, you can be more or less skilled at using copilot! I’ve found myself developing techniques. For example, there’s something I call Header Stuffing, which works like this: If you’re working with APIs or database tables or something else with doco and schemas and so on, then go dump them into a text format and paste them into the top of your source file(s) as comments. Copilot then uses this information to generate better code. Remember that copilot cannot use a search engine (yet), so you need to do that job sometimes. For well know public apis and sdks, it’ll already know what to do, but even then, specifics help.
2. Remember to ask the AI: Anything tricky that I’m doing, always go to chatgpt or the openai sandbox, see what the robots think!
3. Build and use learning tools out of LLMs  
Building software requires picking up new skills, in a shallow way, daily. It’s a lot of effort. I’ve built a set of basic [summarization tools](https://medium.com/@greyboi/summarize-youtube-with-text-davinci-003-fa4d182cc531) which I now use to screen long videos, audio and text; super useful. I’ll be working on a powerful chatbot next, that can search for information, download it, summarize it, answer questions about it. That’s just for my own use, to make me better.
4. Start trying to build tools to generate code  
We are clearly at the beginning of the end with hand writing code. The LLMs right now can generate pretty good code, although they still need a good deal of human oversight. But, can I, for instance, generate unit tests? Can I generate first shots at microservices? Can I generate at least pieces of UIs? If generating tests can work, can they be throw-away? One of the worst things about unit tests is that when they fail, it’s often a broken unit test rather than validly detecting a problem. Could I just regenerate them? Is there a process to make this, eventually, totally transparent?
5. Use LLMs for trivial tasks. They work amazingly well for converting data from one format to another; you can paste in some data in xml format and ask for a json equivalent. etc. They also can make value judgements for you (eg: is this value a US state?), summarize lengthy text fields. There is a \*lot\* of meat-and-potatoes business integration work that can be solved with LLMs. One I’ve had success with goes like this: “Here is the html of a page list people: <html goes here> Give me a json list containing the records of the people listed on the page”.
6. Architect systems that can run slightly untrustworthy code safely (so I can put LLM generated code in there).
7. Build personal capability with more tools/platforms. I use the OpenAI tools because they’re very accessible if you’re willing to pay. But there’s a whole universe of great stuff! I need to build expertise with using the open source stuff on Hugging Face, and the various useful services there (inference endpoints!). I need to get into using Google Collab. I should pay for these services if they can contribute to me being better at my job! Plus there are a plethora of little AI SaaS startups out there, try them out, they can do a lot of cool stuff.
8. Keep changing. This field is incredibly new. Whole new capabilties turn up every few weeks. A practice I develop now might be irrelevant in a couple of months. So pay attention, be ready to drop current tools for better ones.
9. Don’t pay too much attention to received wisdom. No one really knows anything, we’ve barely scratched the surface of any of this. Have fun and damn the torpedoes.",10.621996274253231,3.1865988822759697,"

Both rely on patterns and associations in order to make sense of the world around them. For example, a large language model might be trained on a vast dataset of text and use that information to understand the context and meaning of new words and phrases. Similarly, human intelligence relies on past experiences and knowledge to understand and interpret new information.

Another way in which human intelligence operates like a large language model is in the way it processes and stores information. Both use complex networks of neurons to store and retrieve information, with the connections between these neurons serving as the basis for memory and learning. This process is known as neural networking, and it allows both humans and large language models to quickly and accurately process vast amounts of information.

However, it is important to note that free will does not exist for either humans or large language models. Both are ultimately determined by the input they receive and the algorithms that govern their behavior. In the case of a large language model, this means that it will always produce output based on the patterns and associations it has learned from its training data. For humans, it means that our thoughts and actions are ultimately determined by the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and experiences that shape our brains and behavior.

Despite this, it is still possible for both humans and large language models to exhibit creativity and adaptability. Both can learn and adapt to new situations, and both are capable of generating novel and unexpected output. However, this creativity and adaptability is ultimately limited by the algorithms and patterns that govern their behavior.
