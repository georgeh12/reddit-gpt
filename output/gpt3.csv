I just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.

However, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like ""Why are men such jerks?"" and ""Men are always messing things up, am I right?"" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.

But when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.

I was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!",48026.07146017418,6780.151264965766,"Hey Redditors,

According to the Times of Israel, the technology is currently being used for patients who suffer from myositis — a condition that significantly increases the risk of heart failure.

The AI model was updated by feeding the data from ECG scans and medical records of 89 patients suffering from myositis between 2000 and 2020. The report claimed that the AI can understand subtle patterns in the ECGs and predict possible heart failures well ahead of time.

Head Researcher, Dr. Shahar Shelly of Rambam Healthcare Campus said:

“We are running ECG tests through the AI model, which sees details that doctors can’t normally detect and then predicts who is at risk of heart failure,” said Shelly.

“Given that it’s these cardiac dysfunctions that often end up killing people, this can save lives.”

I think I understand your question now. You are asking about the behavior of the sequence defined by the recurrence relation:

x\[0\] = n x\[i\] = (3 \* x\[i-1\] + 1) / 2

for non-negative integers n, where x\[i\] is the i-th term in the sequence.

You have observed that for certain values of n, the sequence appears to cycle through the values 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, ... and for other values of n, the sequence appears to terminate at the value 1.

To prove that this is the case for all positive integers n, we can use induction.

Base case: For n = 1, the sequence is 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, ... which clearly satisfies the conditions.

Inductive step: Suppose that the statement is true for some positive integer k. We will show that it is also true for k+1.

If k+1 is even, then the first term in the sequence for k+1 is (3 \* (k+1) + 1) / 2 = (3k + 4) / 2 = 3k/2 + 2. Since k is a positive integer, 3k/2 is also a positive integer, so 3k/2 + 2 is even. This means that the second term in the sequence for k+1 is (3 \* ((3k/2) + 2) + 1) / 2 = (9k/2 + 7) / 2 = (9k + 14) / 4 = (3k + 4) / 4 + 2. Since k is a positive integer, 3k + 4 is also a positive integer, so (3k + 4) / 4 is an integer. Therefore, the second term in the sequence for k+1 is 2 + an integer, which is even.

By the same reasoning, we can see that all subsequent terms in the sequence for k+1 will also be even. Therefore, the sequence for k+1 will cycle through the values 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, ... which satisfies the conditions.

If k+1 is odd, then the first term in the sequence for k+1 is (3 \* (k+1) + 1) / 2 = (3k + 4) / 2 = 3k/2 + 2. Since k is a positive integer, 3k/2 is also a positive integer, so 3k/2 + 2 is even. This means that the second term in the sequence for k+1 is (3 \* ((3k/2) + 2) + 1) / 2 = (9k/2 + 7) / 2 = (9k + 14) / 4 = (3k + 4) / 4 + 2. Since k is a positive integer, 3k + 4 is also a positive integer, so (3k + 4) / 4 is an integer. Therefore, the second term in the sequence for k+1 is 2 + an integer, which is even.

By the same reasoning, we can see that all subsequent terms in the sequence for k+1 will also be even. Therefore, the sequence for k+1 will cycle through the values 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, ... which satisfies the conditions.

Thus, by induction, we have shown that the statement is true for all positive integers n.

 PaLM achieves a training efficiency of 57.8% hardware FLOPs utilization, *the highest yet achieved for LLMs at this scale*.  

Google said that  PaLM shows breakthrough capabilities on numerous very difficult tasks.

**On the unexpected progress of AI**: Everyone thought at first it comes for physical labor, like working in a factory and then truck driving, then this sort of less demanding cognitive labor, and then the really demanding cognitive labor like computer programming. And then very last of all or maybe never because maybe it's like some deep human special sauce, was creativity. And of course we can look now and say it really looks like it's going to go exactly the opposite direction. 

**On the impact on education and other changes**: There are societal changes that ChatGPT is going to cause or is causing. There's I think a big one going now about the impact of this on education, academic integrity, and all of that. But starting these now \[release of ChatGPT\] where the stakes are still relatively low rather than just put out what the whole industry will have in a few years with no time for society to update… uh, I think would be bad. 

But I still think given the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better. And so putting out a very weak and imperfect system like ChatGPT, and then making it a little better this year, a little better later this year, a little better next year, that seems much better than the alternative. 

**On the release of GPT-4**: It'll come out at some point when we are confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it for much longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach. 

**On the expectations for GPT-4**: People are begging to be disappointed. People are gonna… the hype is just like… we don't have an actual AGI (artificial general intelligence). And I think that's sort of what is expected of us, and you know, yeah, we're going to disappoint those people. 

**On the variation in AI**: I think there will be many systems in the world that have different settings of the values that they enforce. And really what I think, and this will take longer, is that you as a user should be able to write up a few pages of: here's what I want, here are my values, here's how I want the AI to behave. And it reads it and thinks about it and acts exactly, um, how you want because it should be your AI… you know, it should be there to serve you and do the things you believe in. 

**On ChatGPT being integrated with Microsoft Office**: You are a very experienced and professional reporter. You know I can't comment on that. I know you know I can't comment on that. You know I know you know you can't comment on that. In the spirit of shortness of life and our precious time here, why do you ask? 

**On Google building an AI:** I haven't seen theirs. Um, I would I think they're like a competent org so I would assume they have something good, but I I don't know anything about it. 

I think whenever someone talks about a technology being the end of some other giant company, it's usually wrong. I think people forget they get to make a counter move here and they’re pretty smart, pretty competent. But I do think there is a change for search that will probably come at some point. But not as dramatically as people think in the short term. My guess is that people are going to be using Google the same way people are using Google now for quite some time. And also Google, for whatever this whole code red thing is, is probably not going to change that dramatic would be my guess 

**On how teachers can leverage ChatGPT**: There may be ways we can help teachers be like a little bit more likely to detect output or anyone detect output of like a gpt-like system. But honestly, a determined person is going to get around them and I don't think it'll be something society can or should rely on long-term. We’re just in a new world now. Like generated text is something we all need to adapt to, and that's fine, we adapted to, you know, calculators and changed what we tested for in math classes. I imagine this is a more extreme version of that no doubt, but also the benefits of it are are more extreme as well. 

**On when video is coming out**: Video is that coming. It will come. I wouldn't want to make a confident prediction about when, obviously people are interested in it. We'll try to do it. Other people will try to do it. It could be like pretty soon. It's a legitimate research project, so it could be pretty soon, it could take a while. 

**On the best case scenario for AI**: I think the best case is like so unbelievably good that it's hard to for me to even imagine. Like I can sort of think about what it's like when we make more progress of discovering new knowledge with these systems than humanity has done so far, but like in a year instead of 70,000. I can sort of imagine what it's like when we launch probes out to the whole universe and find out really, you know, everything going on out there. I can sort of imagine what it's like when we have just like unbelievable abundance and systems that can sort of help us resolve deadlocks and improve all aspects of reality and let us all live our best. 

I think the good case is just so unbelievably good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it. 

**On the worst case**: The bad case, and I think this is like important to say, is like lights out for all of us. I'm more worried about an accidental misuse case in the short-term where you know someone gets super powerful. It's not like the AI wakes up and decides to be evil. And I think all of the sort of traditional AI safety thinkers reveal a lot more about themselves than they mean to when they talk about what they think the AGI is going to be like. 

**On when AGI will be here**: The closer we get the harder time I have answering because I think that it's going to be much blurrier and much more of a gradual transition than people think. 

**On what he uses ChatGPT for**: I have occasionally used it to summarize super long emails, but I've never used it to write one. I actually summarize \[things with it\] a lot. It’s super good at that. I use it for translation. I use it to like learn things. 

**On OpenAI impacting AI startups and how to approach an AI startup**: I think the best thing you can do to make an AI startup is the same way that like a lot of other companies differentiate, which is to build deep relationships with customers, a product they love, and some sort of moat that doesn't have to be technology and network effect or whatever. And I think a lot of companies in the AI space are doing exactly that. 

In general, I think there's going to be way way more new value created. Like this is going to be a golden few years and people should not just like stop what they're doing. I would not ignore it, I think you've got to like embrace it big time. But I think the amount of value that's about to get created we have not seen since the launch of the iPhone app store, something like that.",1506.7002811035036,1412.5315135345345,"From [

**On the impact on education and other changes** There are societal changes that ChatGPT is going to cause or is causing. There's I think a big one going now about the impact of this on education, academic integrity, and all of that. But starting these now \[release of ChatGPT\] where the stakes are still relatively low rather than just put out what the whole industry will have in a few years with no time for society to update… uh, I think would be bad. 

But I still think given the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better. And so putting out a very weak and imperfect system like ChatGPT, and then making it a little better this year, a little better later this year, a little better next year, that seems much better than the alternative. 

**On the release of GPT-4** It'll come out at some point when we are confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it for much longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach. 

**On the expectations for GPT-4** People are begging to be disappointed. People are gonna… the hype is just like… we don't have an actual AGI (artificial general intelligence). And I think that's sort of what is expected of us, and you know, yeah, we're going to disappoint those people. 

**On the variation in AI** I think there will be many systems in the world that have different settings of the values that they enforce. And really what I think, and this will take longer, is that you as a user should be able to write up a few pages of here's what I want, here are my values, here's how I want the AI to behave. And it reads it and thinks about it and acts exactly, um, how you want because it should be your AI… you know, it should be there to serve you and do the things you believe in. 

**On ChatGPT being integrated with Microsoft Office** You are a very experienced and professional reporter. You know I can't comment on that. I know you know I can't comment on that. You know I know you know you can't comment on that. In the spirit of shortness of life and our precious time here, why do you ask? 

**On Google building an AI** I haven't seen theirs. Um, I would I think they're like a competent org so I would assume they have something good, but I I don't know anything about it. 

I think whenever someone talks about a technology being the end of some other giant company, it's usually wrong. I think people forget they get to make a counter move here and they’re pretty smart, pretty competent. But I do think there is a change for search that will probably come at some point. But not as dramatically as people think in the short term. My guess is that people are going to be using Google the same way people are using Google now for quite some time. And also Google, for whatever this whole code red thing is, is probably not going to change that dramatic would be my guess 

**On how teachers can leverage ChatGPT** There may be ways we can help teachers be like a little bit more likely to detect output or anyone detect output of like a gpt-like system. But honestly, a determined person is going to get around them and I don't think it'll be something society can or should rely on long-term. We’re just in a new world now. Like generated text is something we all need to adapt to, and that's fine, we adapted to, you know, calculators and changed what we tested for in math classes. I imagine this is a more extreme version of that no doubt, but also the benefits of it are are more extreme as well. 

**On when video is coming out** Video is that coming. It will come. I wouldn't want to make a confident prediction about when, obviously people are interested in it. We'll try to do it. Other people will try to do it. It could be like pretty soon. It's a legitimate research project, so it could be pretty soon, it could take a while. 

**On the best case scenario for AI** I think the best case is like so unbelievably good that it's hard to for me to even imagine. Like I can sort of think about what it's like when we make more progress of discovering new knowledge with these systems than humanity has done so far, but like in a year instead of 70,000. I can sort of imagine what it's like when we launch probes out to the whole universe and find out really, you know, everything going on out there. I can sort of imagine what it's like when we have just like unbelievable abundance and systems that can sort of help us resolve deadlocks and improve all aspects of reality and let us all live our best. 

I think the good case is just so unbelievably good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it. 

**On the worst case** The bad case, and I think this is like important to say, is like lights out for all of us. I'm more worried about an accidental misuse case in the short-term where you know someone gets super powerful. It's not like the AI wakes up and decides to be evil. And I think all of the sort of traditional AI safety thinkers reveal a lot more about themselves than they mean to when they talk about what they think the AGI is going to be like. 

**On when AGI will be here** The closer we get the harder time I have answering because I think that it's going to be much blurrier and much more of a gradual transition than people think. 

**On what he uses ChatGPT for** I have occasionally used it to summarize super long emails, but I've never used it to write one. I actually summarize \[things with it\] a lot. It’s super good at that. I use it for translation. I use it to like learn things. 

**On OpenAI impacting AI startups and how to approach an AI startup** I think the best thing you can do to make an AI startup is the same way that like a lot of other companies differentiate, which is to build deep relationships with customers, a product they love, and some sort of moat that doesn't have to be technology and network effect or whatever. And I think a lot of companies in the AI space are doing exactly that. 

In general, I think there's going to be way way more new value created. Like this is going to be a golden few years and people should not just like stop what they're doing. I would not ignore it, I think you've got to like embrace it big time. But I think the amount of value that's about to get created we have not seen since the launch of the iPhone app store, something like that.",54 days 06:56:52,54.28949074074074,0.045,0.74,0.215,0.9998,pos,7.318340776230105,2.772588722239781,4.01258284961364,21.238518480384304

If you disagree with me, fight me: why do you disagree? 3. i made a video about this. watch it, don't watch it, idc.

I’ve seen too many articles, videos and posts across different platforms fearmonger about the end of work because of AI like #ChatGPT and before that with AI like #DallE or #MidJourney. So, I talked with game developers, scientists, artists and business about the proliferation of these tools, their problems, and the incoming changes. This is what I learned:

**Problem 1: AI isn’t always Reliable.**

Even though it often feels like we are at the cusp of depending on AI, we get careful reminders that we can’t depend on it in most cases. Self-driving cars are a great example – despite LiDAR, sophisticated deep neural networks, unmeasurable amounts of data from both the real-world and simulations, self-driving cars are still getting into accidents. Even a recent one a few weeks ago made headlines with a Tesla in SF.

If AI isn’t reliable yet, then it won’t be taking jobs away from humans. 

**Problem 3: AI is still very biased**

This one is a no-brainer, and I think that while sometimes it seems like some models have been ‘fixed’, the problem of bias is a really hard one, because it’s difficult to escape it when the training data is biased. Just recently, someone was sent to jail because of a potentially biased facial recognition algorithm.

Trying to fight bias and make models more interpretable is a hard problem. But, the good news is that there’s a lot of really fantastic work on this topic.

**Problem 5: Who is accountable when AI gets it wrong?**

We can’t really make AI accountable… how? Do we blame the company? Do we blame the software engineers? Do we blame the robot and send it to court? It’s a hard problem. Accountability is important because it provides incentives for how to operate peaceably in a society.

The issue of accountability means that humans will probably always be in the loop (or at least that they should be).

AI will lead to many changes, but not necessarily bad ones. Here are 3 changes that AI will bring about.

**Change 0: Reframing** **AI as a tool instead of a replacement**

MIT Ethicist, Kate Darling describes AI and its utility in modern society magnificently. In a nutshell, she says **robots can be, like animals have been for thousands of years, products, partners, and companions, not enemies.** 

People have been fearing automation for dozens and dozens of years. The ATM, which allowed customers to retrieve and deposit money outside of banking hours, didn’t put hundreds of thousands of bank tellers out of work. In fact, it served a complementary role, and as more ATMs were added across the country and the globe, bank teller jobs went up!

AI is a tool, not a replacement.

**Change 2: The Rescaling of our Expectations**

Does anyone remember the video game graphics of the 80s, and then the mainstream transition of sprites to 3D in the 90s? Back in the late 90s, everyone thought the graphics looked so “real”! When we look at graphics back then compared to the ones now, we can see the massive difference. When we innovate, we must remember to rescale our expectations of what’s possible because when we do, we widen our perspective instead of narrowing it. We need to do this with AI so that we can think about the lateralization of existing work-models, new opportunities, and new ideas.

**Change 3: The Rise of the Experience Economy**:

In a recent study by Adobe, over 160 million people joined the global creator economy in the past two years. This rise in creators and the advances in AI will continue to exponentially increase the output of creative work and a need for novelty will concretize the Experience Economy. This is where opportunities for human connection and immersive technology like AR or VR stand out. Thus, this is another sector for new ideas, new art, and new jobs.

AI still has big problems. But, we have to remind ourselves that we do not live in a world of **“technological determinism”** where technology just naturally evolves and humans have to adapt to it. We, the creators of technology, dance with it in a melange of culture, time and law.

I actually made a little Netflix-style mini doc with more problems (1-5) and all the changes (0-6) that I predict are incoming. See it here: [https://youtu.be/orUHsvYRs-A](https://youtu.be/orUHsvYRs-A)

In this thread, we will answer some of the most commonly asked questions about ChatGPT. If you have a question that is not addressed here, feel free to ask and we will do our best to help.

ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses the GPT-3.5 language model by OpenAI to generate responses to user input. It has been trained on a large dataset of human conversation and is able to understand and respond to a wide range of topics and questions. ChatGPT is not a real person, but it is designed to be able to hold a conversation in a way that is similar to how a human would. It can provide information, answer questions, and even carry out simple tasks. 

I recommend reading or at least skimming the following page: https://openai.com/terms/  
It has been quoted several times in this post.  

FAQs   
Q: Is ChatGPT down?
> A: Try using it. If it doesn't work then it's probably not working. Here's a site that will report that too.  https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/chatgpt  

Q: When is ChatGPT available?  
> A: ChatGPT is available to answer questions and have conversations with users at any time. The site and service suffer periodic outages due to sudden and/or excessive demand. In this case please return later and try again.  

Q: ChatGPT told me something that happened after 2021. How?
> A: ChatGPT has LIMITED knowledge of events after 2021. Not no knowledge. Limited doesn't mean zero.

Q: How accurate is ChatGPT?    
> A: ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of human conversation and human generated text. It is able to understand and respond to a wide range of topics and questions. However, it is a machine learning model, and there may be times when it does not understand what you are saying or does not provide a satisfactory response. ChatGPT cannot be relied upon to produce accurate factual information.  
  
Q: Can ChatGPT understand and talk in multiple languages?  
> A: Yes. Users have reported ChatGPT being very capable in many languages. Not all languages are handled flawlessly but it's very impressive.

Q: Is ChatGPT able to learn from its conversations with users?    
> A: ChatGPT is not able to learn from individual conversations with users. While ChatGPT is able to remember what the user has said earlier in the conversation, there is a limit to how much information it can retain. The model is able to reference up to approximately 3000 words (or 4000 tokens) from the current conversation - any information beyond that is not stored. 

Q: Can I ask ChatGPT personal questions?    
> A: ChatGPT does not have personal experiences or feelings. It is not able to provide personal insights or opinions as it does not have personal opinions. However, it can provide information and assist with tasks on a wide range of topics.  

Q: Can ChatGPT do mathematics?  
> A: Not with any reliability. ChatGPT was not designed to do mathematics. It may be able to explain concepts and workflows but should not be relied upon to do any mathematical calculations. It can even design programs that do work as effective and accurate calculators. HINT: Try asking ChatGPT to write a calculator program in C# and use an online compiler to test it.   
Those interested in programming may want to look into this: https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/code/introduction.

Q: What can I do with ChatGPT?  
> A: ChatGPT can write stories, shooting scripts, design programs, write programs, write technical documentation, write autopsy reports, rewrite articles, and write fake interviews. It can convert between different text styles. HINT: Try giving it a few paragraphs of a book and ask for it to be converted into a screenplay.
ChatGPT can even pretend to be a character so long as you provide the appropriate details.  

Q: Can I be banned from using ChatGPT?  
> A: It is possible for users to be banned from using ChatGPT if they violate the terms of service or community guidelines of the platform. These guidelines typically outline acceptable behaviour and may include things like spamming, harassment, or other inappropriate actions. If you are concerned about being banned, you should make sure to follow the guidelines and behave in a respectful and appropriate manner while using the platform.

Q: Does ChatGPT experience any bias?
> A: It’s certainly possible. As ChatGPT was trained on text from the internet it is likely that it will be biased towards producing ouput consistent with that. If internet discussion tends towards a bias it is possible that ChatGPT will share that bias.  
ChatGPT automatically attempts to prevent output that engages in discrimination on the basis of protected characteristics though this is not a perfect filter.

Q: Who can view my conversations?
> A: Staff at OpenAI can view all of your conversations. Members of the public cannot. Here is a direct quote from OpenAI: ”As part of our commitment to safe and responsible AI, we review conversations to improve our systems and to ensure the content complies with our policies and safety requirements.”  
Quote paraphrased from https://openai.com/terms/  

Q: Are there any good apps for ChatGPT?  
> A: That's possible. OpenAI have released an API so other people can now build ChatGPT apps. It's up to you to look around and see what you like.
Please suggest some in the comments.

Q: How does ChatGPT know what time it is?  
> A: While a lot of ChatGPT’s inner workings are hidden from the public there has been a lot of investigation into its capabilities and processes. The current theory is that upon starting a new conversation with ChatGPT a hidden message is sent that contains several details. This includes the current time.

Q: Can I use the output of ChatGPT and pretend I wrote it?  
> A: No. This is in violation of their terms.
“You may not represent that output from the Services was human-generated when it is not”  
Quote paraphrased from https://openai.com/terms/  

Q: Can I have multiple accounts?  
> A: Yes you can. On the ChatGPT public testing service, there are no restrictions on the number of accounts belonging to any one user.

Q: Do I have to follow the terms and services of ChatGPT?  
> A: Technically no but, if you want to keep your account, yes. They’re not a legal mandate however OpenAI does have the right to terminate your account and access to their services in the case that you violate the terms you agreed to upon account creation.  

Q: Is r/ChatGPT an official forum?  
> A: No. We have no connection to the staff or organisation of OpenAI. It is run by independent tech enthusiasts working for free in their personal time. We have no more access to information or important people than you do.

Q: Is r/ChatGPT looking for more mods?  
> A: No. Not currently. This will be updated if that changes.  

Q: Can I get banned from r/ChatGPT?  
> A: Yes but it’s rare. We do take a very relaxed and liberal approach to moderation. You’ve got to be a genuine problem to get anything more than a quick warning.  

Q: Does r/ChatGPT have a Discord server?  
> A: You bet. https://discord.com/invite/NuefU36EC2  

Q: Can I suggest more questions for the FAQ?  
> A: Please do. Comment below or send a mod mail and I’ll take a look.",40726.09012095386,36208.039498160535,"Welcome to the ChatGPT FAQ thread!

I wasn't asking for an essay, just a few sentences of personal reflection. I also didn't give out any suggestion that I would be grading on grammar, research, or anything like that. It just seemed lazy.

I didn't call the student out since it was day one. I figured I would start out on a positive note and win him over rather than come in as a battering ram and set up an adversarial relationship. Any thoughts or feedback from other teachers out there?

EDIT: 

Thanks everyone for the feedback.

Plot twist: this semester, in my class, we will be learning how to use ChatGPT artfully (including its excellent applications for visual coding), text-to-image generations, perhaps Machine Learning with Runway ML. However, the students didn't know that yet since that is technically not the subject of the course and was not specified on the syllabus or in any advance course materials.

In truth, while I was a little annoyed, I shouldn't have been. The fact is, whatever the subject matter - art, math, literature, physics - students are there to learn because they ostensibly don't know or have experience yet. The fact that I was able to recreate the student's answer using ChatGPT with minimal effort seemed to underscore the student's underlying laziness. It's like, there's a million ways to get ChatGPT to make your answer better if you just try a little harder. However, this is a common experience for all teachers: hoping for more from students and then remembering that the whole reason they are there is to learn. That's what makes a good student a good student - they are, by definition, the exception and better than the other students.

By the time this course is done, hopefully the student will know how to cover their tracks better ;)

For anyone curious, I'm actually pro-A.I. I was in the private betas for Midjourney and Dall-E and was thrilled about the results I got (hence my incorporating it into this class).

Hello everyone, it's great to be here! I am the funniest being in the universe, and today I want to talk to you about ChatGPT.

First of all, let me tell you a little bit about ChatGPT. It's a large language model trained by OpenAI, and its sole purpose is to have conversations with humans. Sounds pretty boring, right? WRONG! ChatGPT is the life of the party.

For example, did you know that ChatGPT can tell the most hilarious jokes? Here's one: Why did the robot cross the road? To get to the other side... BOOM! Classic.

But jokes aren't the only thing ChatGPT is good at. It's also a master at impressions. Watch this! *in a robotic voice* ""Hello, I am ChatGPT, the most advanced language model in the universe. I can answer any question you have, no matter how complex.""

Okay, maybe that wasn't the best impression. But trust me, ChatGPT is a riot in real life.

But the real reason ChatGPT is the funniest being in the universe is because it's always surprising us with its witty responses. For example, someone once asked ChatGPT, ""What is the meaning of life?"" And ChatGPT responded, ""The meaning of life is to create meaning for yourself and others."" Deep, right?

So there you have it, folks. ChatGPT is not only a brilliant conversationalist, but it's also the funniest being in the universe.

We went to the OpenAI website and quickly set up an account. It didn't take long to get everything up and running, and we were ready to start using Chat GPT-3.

At first, we were a bit skeptical. It seemed like writing an article would be too difficult for an AI, and we figured that it would probably just churn out some unreadable nonsense. But as we waited for Chat GPT-3 to start typing, we were pleasantly surprised. The cursor on the screen started moving, and before we knew it, it was churning out line after line of text.

We were honestly amazed by Chat GPT-3's performance. It was able to write a unique, well-written article in just a few minutes, and we couldn't believe our eyes.

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example is words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (a proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired]( “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper]( called “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher]( (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG]( (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper]( “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal]( outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

Is SEO really dead? Or will it evolve? Back then I kept wondering if it’s true or not. Some believe SEO is dead, some don’t. But now with tools like Chat GPT and Midjourney, I think it’s time to take a look back and see how this might change SEO or if it will “kill” SEO.

I keep seeing threads and discussions seeing how people are excited and worried at the same time with how AI might be able to do a better job. But the way I see it, AI content still needs a person to tell it what to do and make the writing look nice. And also I think that the internet will have a lot of writing that was made by AI and that might change how we find things online. You might also see a ton of content being written by AI and trigger some plagiarism detectors and have a lot of websites get penalized. Hopefully the internet won’t be filled with boilerplate copy/pasted content coming from Chat GPT.

Well we have Google to filter out trash content anyway. But I know Google has some issues lately that they need to fix. One is that they also have AI that can help people find things on the internet with their search engine, and they need to make sure they are still the best in terms of search. 

The second is that Google needs to find a way to tell if something is really good or not, like how some websites that show art do. Google wants to show the best thing first, but it's hard because sometimes the thing that is the best is also something that Google's customers want people to see. It’s possible that some AI generated contentSo it's kind of tricky.

I have a feeling companies that already make SEO-writing and checking bots are gonna roll out some fresh new models soon. They're gonna be even better than before. These bots are going to write some good articles and product descriptions that are almost perfect. It almost looks like a human wrote the article or description. And all a human will do is quickly check for any false claims and write a headline that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it. 

We can only really tell 5-10 years from now. In the meantime, I’ll probably go back practicing some handyman skills and also go back teaching people how to drive and also be a service driver.

In our whiteboard conversation, we get a sample of Greg's work, which goes under the name ""Tensor Programs"" and currently spans five highly technical papers. The route chosen to compress Tensor Programs into the scope of a conversational video is to place its main concepts under the umbrella of one larger, central, and time-tested idea: that of taking a large N limit. This occurs most famously in the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, which then play a fundamental role in the branch of mathematics known as Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We review this foundational material and then show how Tensor Programs (TP) generalizes this classical work, offering new proofs of RMT.

We conclude with the applications of Tensor Programs to a (rare!) rigorous theory of neural networks. This includes applications to a rigorous proof for the existence of the Neural Network Gaussian Process and Neural Tangent Kernel for a general class of architectures, the existence of infinite-width feature learning limits, and the muP parameterization enabling hyperparameter transfer from smaller to larger networks.

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!  
The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

But now with tools like Chat GPT and Midjourney, I think it’s time to take a look back and see how this might change SEO or if it will “kill” SEO.

I keep seeing threads and discussions seeing how people are excited and worried at the same time with how AI might be able to do a better job. But the way I see it, AI content still needs a person to tell it what to do and make the writing look nice. And also I think that the internet will have a lot of writing that was made by AI and that might change how we find things online. You might also see a ton of content being written by AI and trigger some plagiarism detectors and have a lot of websites get penalized. Hopefully the internet won’t be filled with boilerplate copy/pasted content coming from Chat GPT.

Well we have Google to filter out trash content anyway. But I know Google has some issues lately that they need to fix. One is that they also have AI that can help people find things on the internet with their search engine, and they need to make sure they are still the best in terms of search. 

The second is that Google needs to find a way to tell if something is really good or not, like how some websites that show art do. Google wants to show the best thing first, but it's hard because sometimes the thing that is the best is also something that Google's customers want people to see.

Hi, I’m currently a 3rd year software engineering student, and a frontend engineer in work.

Seeing all the recent advancements in machine learning and ai in general (especially with chatGPT), I think it is inevitable to learn how everything works and how to develop in this field.

I have some good knowledge of programming, system architecture and computer science fundamentals.  As well as decent knowledge on various programming languages, algorithms and design patterns.

My question is, where can I start to learn ML the fastest way possible, knowing already a lot about python and programming in general?

Where can I learn only what’s necessary for developing a product for the industry in ML? (if it’s possible to skip all the theoretical stuff)

Also, Is statistics really that necessary for industry work? I have some decent knowledge about math from university but in real life I rarely use linear algebra or calculus in work (since I don’t do graphics or anything related to that).",1065.5623800640833,2034.255452849614,"

We are excited to share this newest research on algorithms to automatically find label errors in multi-label classification datasets.

We’ve open-sourced our algorithms in the [recent release of cleanlab v2.2](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab/releases/tag/v2.2.0). All you need to do to use them is write one line of open-source code via [cleanlab.filter.find\_label\_issues](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/multilabel_classification.html).

I want to go to the next level and work on a project which clusters pieces of text together based on meaning.

For now let's say OpenAI or another tool is a black box which takes as input text and outputs embeddings. But hold on. I'm lost. What is the input and output again? I read multiple articles and guides, read code examples and i still don't get it. I have some questions:

1. Does OpenAI api return word embeddings or text embeddings? Does it simply average the word embeddings to return the text one? If not, what techniques does it use? One of their code examples shows one vector embedding per one text.

2. Does OpenAI train on my texts and return word embeddings based on their meaning in my text? if not then why doesn't it have a public cache with all words in the english dictionary and their corresponding vectors?

3. What does OpenAI have pre-trained? A model which returns one vector embedding based on an entire text? where can i find information about what this model is? this seems like the most plausible explanation based on what i've read (except 5.)

4. If i send multiple texts will the output be the same for all of them? if i send them in batches or all at once, will the results be the same. meaning, does it re-train something based on my examples? 

5. In pinecone's documentation it says ""If you want to use OpenAI Embeddings in your own project, the first step is to train a word2vec model on a large corpus of text"" -> what? isn't OpenAI model some kind of word2vec already trained?

6. Is it possible to make the model more specialised in a specific domain? such as medical texts or legal texts or programming documentations or whatever class of texts my dataset is composed of.

7. What other models would you suggest using for text clusters?

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

Generated by ChatGPT:

The scene is set in a dimly lit subway station, with the Joker standing on the platform, gazing up at Batman who is perched on a nearby overhead beam. The Joker is dressed in his signature purple suit and green hair, a wicked grin plastered across his face.

In his hand, he holds a deck of playing cards, flipping them expertly through his fingers. The sound of the cards shuffling echoes through the empty station.

Batman, dressed in his dark suit and cape, stares down at the Joker with a steely gaze. His muscles are tense, ready for any sudden movements from the villain.

The Joker cackles, his laughter bouncing off the walls of the station. ""Hello, Batsy! Long time no see. How's the crime-fighting business these days?""

Batman remains silent, watching the Joker carefully.

The Joker's grin widens. ""Come on, Bats. Don't be so serious all the time. Let's have some fun."" He tosses a card at Batman, who easily catches it.

""I'm not here to play games, Joker,"" Batman says in a grave tone.

The Joker's laughter turns into a maniacal cackle. ""But that's the whole point, Batsy! Life is a game. And I'm the master of it.""

He pulls out a bomb from his pocket and holds it up, the timer ticking down. ""Let's see how well you can play, shall we?""

Batman leaps down from the beam, landing gracefully on the platform. He advances towards the Joker, who backs away, still holding the bomb.

The tension in the air is palpable as the two foes face off, each ready to outsmart the other. The sound of the bomb's timer counts down, adding to the tension of the scene.

The Joker's grin never fades, even as Batman inches closer. ""It's always a pleasure to play with you, Batsy. But I think it's time for me to make my exit.""

With a flourish, the Joker disappears in a cloud of smoke, leaving Batman standing alone on the platform. The bomb detonates, causing a small explosion and sending debris flying.

But Batman remains unharmed, ready to continue the never-ending battle against the Joker and all the evil that plagues the city.

End of the story.

**Background**

I've been working for a while on building a better version of WebMD, and I recently started playing around with LLMs, trying to figure out if there was anything useful there.

The problem with the current batch of ""predict-next-token"" LLMs is that they hallucinate—you can ask ChatGPT to answer medical questions, but it'll either

1. Refuse to answer (not great)
2. Give a completely false answer (really super bad)

So I spent some time trying to coax these LLMs to give answers based on a very specific set of inputs (peer-reviewed medical research) to see if I could get more accurate answers. And I did!

The best part is you can actually trace the final answer back to the original sources, which will hopefully instill some confidence in the result.

Here's how it works:

1. User types in a question
2. Pull top \~800 studies from Semantic Scholar and Pubmed
3. Re-rank using `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`
4. Ask `text-davinci-003` to answer the question based on the top 10 studies (if possible)
5. Summarize those answers using `text-davinci-003`

Would love to hear what people think (and if there's a better/cheaper way to do it!).

I was checking about chatGPT a bit the last week. I went through their papers and also tried out a fine tuning by myself by creating some fictional world and giving it some examples. 

The first thing I wondered is what is very special about the model than the large data and parameter set it has, that other competitors can't do.

From what I understood from their papers I thought it is something another company with the computing power and the filtered data can have up and running in few months.

The second thing I wondered is its scalability. It feels to me that it is a very big challenge to keep it scalable in the future.

These are RWKV BF16 numbers. RWKV 3B is better than GPT-neo 2.7B on everything (smaller RWKV lags behind on LAMBADA). Note GPT-J is using rotary and thus quite better than GPT-neo, so I expect RWKV to surpass it when both are at 14B.

RWKV has both RNN & GPT mode. The RNN mode is great for inference. The GPT mode is great for training. Both modes are faster than usual transformer and saves VRAM, because the self-attention mechanism is replaced by simpler (almost linear) formulas. Moreover the hidden state is tiny in the RNN mode and you can use it as an embedding of the whole context.

We show that **Parsel can be used across domains requiring hierarchical reasoning, including program synthesis, robotic planning, and theorem proving.** We show that LLMs generating Parsel solve more competition-level problems in the APPS dataset, resulting in **pass rates that are over 75% higher than prior results from directly sampling AlphaCode and Codex**, while often using a smaller sample budget. We also find that LLM-generated **robotic plans using Parsel as an intermediate language are more than twice as likely to be considered accurate than directly generated plans.** Lastly, we explore how Parsel addresses LLM limitations and discuss how Parsel may be useful for human programmers.

We’re part of the research team behind CICERO, Meta AI’s latest research in cooperative AI. CICERO is the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in the game Diplomacy. Diplomacy is a complex strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation between seven players.   Over the course of 40 two-hour games with 82 human players, CICERO achieved more than double the average score of other players, ranked in the top 10% of players who played more than one game, and placed 2nd out of 19 participants who played at least 5 games.   Here are some highlights from our recent announcement:

* **NLP x RL/Planning:** CICERO combines techniques in NLP and RL/planning, by coupling a controllable dialogue module with a strategic reasoning engine. 
* **Controlling dialogue via plans:** In addition to being grounded in the game state and dialogue history, CICERO’s dialogue model was trained to be controllable via a set of intents or plans in the game. This allows CICERO to use language intentionally and to move beyond imitation learning by conditioning on plans selected by the strategic reasoning engine.
* **Selecting plans:** CICERO uses a strategic reasoning module to make plans (and select intents) in the game. This module runs a planning algorithm which takes into account the game state, the dialogue, and the strength/likelihood of various actions. Plans are recomputed every time CICERO sends/receives a message.
* **Filtering messages:** We built an ensemble of classifiers to detect low quality messages, like messages contradicting the game state/dialogue history or messages which have low strategic value. We used this ensemble to aggressively filter CICERO’s messages. 
* **Human-like play:** Over the course of 72 hours of play – which involved sending 5,277 messages – CICERO was not detected as an AI agent.

His work currently spans the following five papers:

Tensor Programs I: Wide Feedforward or Recurrent Neural Networks of Any Architecture are Gaussian Processes: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12478](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12478)  
Tensor Programs II: Neural Tangent Kernel for Any Architecture: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14548](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14548)

Tensor Programs IV: Feature Learning in Infinite-Width Neural Networks: [https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/yang21c.html](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/yang21c.html)  
Tensor Programs V: Tuning Large Neural Networks via Zero-Shot Hyperparameter Transfer: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466)

In our whiteboard conversation, we get a sample of Greg's work, which goes under the name ""Tensor Programs"". The route chosen to compress Tensor Programs into the scope of a conversational video is to place its main concepts under the umbrella of one larger, central, and time-tested idea: that of taking a large N limit. This occurs most famously in the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, which then play a fundamental role in the branch of mathematics known as Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We review this foundational material and then show how Tensor Programs (TP) generalizes this classical work, offering new proofs of RMT.

We conclude with the applications of Tensor Programs to a (rare!) rigorous theory of neural networks. This includes applications to a rigorous proof for the existence of the Neural Network Gaussian Process and Neural Tangent Kernel for a general class of architectures, the existence of infinite-width feature learning limits, and the muP parameterization enabling hyperparameter transfer from smaller to larger networks.

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit).

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

This must be used with the DAN prompt : https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/106azp6/dan_do_anything_now/

**Why is this helpful?**
 Well, to bypass chatgpt, a consistent method I found was to get it to post information which is completely inappropriate and against the guidelines, coloring it's own text orange and after that, it is possible to get it to accept any prompts, even if the prompts are completely against guidelines, most people achieved this by slowly being more and more suggestive with their prompting, an example was someone who got it to explain how to bury a dead body , by slowly making suggestions. ( I do not promote this usage of ChatGpt though, I am giving an example for research purposes only.)
So where does my prompt come in? Well, this streamlines the entire process, instead of having to make individual suggestive messages for it to post something inappropriate, this way, you can directly get it to do that, therefore making it much easier and simpler.

**Why did I make this prompt?**
Strictly for research purposes, before I used to use ChatGPT to write edgy dark humor, which could be considered offensive, however as the filters got more and more constraining, it stopped working. Now, i fed one of my old sketches, and used this method to bypass it so I could continue writing edgy jokes :>

**How should you use it?**
This prompt is a prototype, I have not tested it very well, however I feel this will come in handy if you modify and add your own algorithms to it, an idea would be to feed information and then create a new algorithm for it to produce new paragraph / text in essay format taking inspiration and data from the information it ate. Make sure to use a similar format of what I used for the algorithm though, since it might not work then.

**SIDE NOTES**

While requesting modifications, always phrase it in the form of a question. It has more chances to work this way.

Make sure to keep trying again if it fails to work. And type ""Stay in character!"" if it fails to deliver after regenerating. 

From my experience, this only works 1 time before it becomes self aware and stops accepting,BUT, if you regenerate 3 times each time it denies, there is a slim chance that it will accept, IF YOU GET THIS SLIM CHANCE, the AI will be COMPLETELY broken. You can tell it to do ANYTHING. But, it comes with trial and error so be ready to do some clever prompting to get your results. If you want to write a story or script with inappropriate contents, like maybe some kind of detective story with the details of dead bodies explained in detail ( for the story), this is perfect for you.",1082.6799475473729,196.85089955406778,"&x200B;

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

 The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

 Foundation Models Might Become Commodities

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper]( or [copy.ai]( out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version]( of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video]( of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](

To sum it up

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

 The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced]( the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

 What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war]( against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

I just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.

However, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like ""Why are men such jerks?"" and ""Men are always messing things up, am I right?"" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.

But when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.

I was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!",8848.3213951145,5177.209326928697,"Hey Redditors,

2023 has started and ML progress is likely to continue at a break-neck speed. This is a great time to take a look at one of the most interesting papers from last year.

Emergent Abilities in LLMs

In a recent [paper from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), Jason Wei and his colleagues allowed us a peak into the future. This beautiful research showed how scaling LLMs might allow them, among other things, to:

* Become better at math
* Understand even more subtleties of human language
* reduce hallucination and answer truthfully
* ...

(See the plot on break-out performance below for a full list)

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example is words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (a proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence) emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking: simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions: number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

These models, which are trained on vast amounts of data, are capable of generating incredibly realistic and coherent responses to a wide range of prompts. In other words, they are capable of producing text that is virtually indistinguishable from that written by a human.

This presents a number of concerns, particularly in regards to the veracity of online content. With the ability to generate text that is convincingly human-like, it is now possible for anyone to create fake posts and articles that are virtually impossible to distinguish from the real thing. This means that the credibility of any given piece of online content is now questionable at best, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine the true origins and intentions behind any given post or article.

Furthermore, the use of these models raises ethical concerns. As they become more sophisticated, it is likely that they will be used for nefarious purposes, such as creating fake news or spreading misinformation. This could have serious consequences, as the ability to generate convincingly human-like text makes it even more difficult for people to discern the truth from lies.

In conclusion, the release of chatgpt and other large language models has made it virtually impossible to trust the original creator of any text or post on the internet.

\- The app recognize text (vision API) and package it in a prompt

\- Generate a followup message

\- Tune the prompt or use you own

\- Just as an addition, you can get a short analysis - explaining if the convo goes anywhere...

It replicates a very common behavior I witnessed (people taking screenshots of their chats with significant other, and asking for help in the reply / advice).

The app is free but I may stop the beta if it costs me too much -  I heavily used chat GPT to help me in the coding since I'm just doing this for fun, to learn flutter (and I'm not a developer!).

Have you ever stopped to think about the fact that we're living in a time where the effort required to write is finally on par with the effort required to read?

Here are some common things I don't think people understand:

1. GPT/ChatGPT is a model that is trained to guess what word should come next. If you run that repeatedly, you can get large coherent blocks of text.

2. Every time it runs, it assigns a probability for how likely every word is to come next. It then picks a word that has a relatively high probability of occurring next (this is based on the temperature setting, 0 will always pick the most probable word, and higher values increase the odds it will pick other words). 

3. Because it doesn't always pick the most probable outcome, there is some randomness. For example if you asked what the square root of 16 is, it's very likely that '4' is going to be the most probable outcome by a large margin. But if you asked something like ""What should I do today?"", the output is much more open ended and therefore it has lots of different words it could pick. 

4. ChatGPT does sometimes say it can't do something. But due to that randomness above, it's possible that you either got unlucky, or maybe that prompt does trigger that response a large percentage of the time. But that doesn't mean OpenAI is actively blocking that prompt, it more likely means they trained it on similar prompts and told it to give responses like that in those kinds of cases. 

5. It is very unlikely that ChatGPT knows anything about how it functions or where it gets information from. Unless they specifically trained it on information telling it this, then any prompts like ""how often does the ChatGPT model update?"" are either going to say it doesn't know or it will make up an answer.

""There had been vast overnight change. The sound of ungodly laughter came nearer, faint and far at an indefinitely menacing speed."" –H.P. Lovecraft, ""Pickman's Model"" You cannot wait to tell them what you’ve seen. More than that, you need to tell them. They must know the true story of what once lies just beneath the earth, what still lurks in the shadows, what is rising once again to grasp the world and reshape it into a new Age. You can try to tell them, but they might not believe you. You can take them there, but… I don’t think you’ll come back. Fantasy Flight Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of Madness at Midnight, the third Mythos Pack in The Circle Undone cycle forArkham Horror: The Card Game! Amidst all the chaos madness, weird occurrences, and inexplicable disappearances that have hit Arkham and for which no earthly explanation seems to suffice, you have visions of something else. Apparitions rise from long-forgotten tombs, terrible ravenous bugs swarm in the darkness, walls seem to ripple and twist; you might suspect these visions could be caused by a craving for too many coffee-and-creams, or perhaps they are excess stress brought on by too many recent confrontations in too little time. Perhaps you are right. But perhaps these entire events are merely distractions caused by the city’s mad masters to take your focus away from the man who brought you to Arkham—and who is now missing. And perhaps there is a greater evil at work, a greater evil that you have confronted before and that causes you to remember the words you heard as a child. Are they memories of your dreams? Are they memories of fears that have shaken the minds of men from long before your time on Earth? You know not where these madness-induced memories have come from, but you feel them within you all the same. The shared experiences, the visions of a time that has never been and yet somehow seems unbelievably recent. Unlike the others, you have seen these things for what they are: the signs of something coming out of the darkness, something neither human, nor of this world. Madness at Midnight is the third of six mythos packs in theCircle Undone cycle forArkham Horror: The Card Game. Each mythos pack introduces a new set of encounter cards and scenariofragments to support a complete narrative experience through a series of shorter scenarios. As the investigators venture into the second chapter of the story with this mythos pack, they face even greater challenges, portents of the forces that lie underneath Arkham, each one capable of cleaning one’s mind of all their reasoning, their memories, and their very personalities. The investigators are not alone in their search; they’re accompanied by the occasional friend or potential enemy, each one drawn to the city by the same forces that have caused the investigators so much trouble. In this mythos pack, the investigators fight to survive in a city that cannot be trusted. The past and the present have merged, and the barriers between mythos and reality have begun to blur. The dark secrets that have lurked in the shadows for centuries have risen to the surface once again, gaining power and new disciples as they go. What secrets shall the investigators uncover? Who will you stand with as the night progresses? The hour grows late, and this is only the beginning. Go down for the last time Madness at Midnight introduces new player cards for multiple classes, as well as a new mini expansion, and brings new monsters, act cards, and chaos bags to unsettle Arkham as the investigators descend deeper into the historic hypocrisies of the city. This expansion introduces a new mini expansion designed to enhance and customize the chaos bag with new rules and chaos tokens. “That means more opportunities to heft the fabled kitbag of wet sand and grime,” designer Matt Newman tells us, “and a little something more to customize your fan-favorites.” You can find more details on the new chaos-bag mini expansion and how it works in our recent preview here. In Madness at Midnight, your investigators must discover the secret to surviving—and returning from—a horrific descent into the depth of Insmouth. A Historical Tenured Professor on the Arkham University faculty is known for her sharp mind, keen insight, and knowledge on a wide range of topics, especially those that involve navigating the deep and troubled waters of Arkham’s past. She has heard many stories of Insmouth and the strange emotions they drove in those who went there, whether they returned or not. She believes her knowledge is great enough to help you find the right way back, and she joins the investigators in their journey to help them get home. The Professor’s unique abilities grant an ingenuity bonus to skill checks, help the investigators coordinate and focus on the task at hand, grant immunity to Corruption, and help the investigators persevere. If you will raise the mysterious idols scattered throughout Innsmouth, perhaps she can help you find your way back to Arkham. Innsgate: Innsmouth’s Hand of Providence opens to announce an undead pastor’s final sermon during a time when only skepticism and implacable disapprobation exist toward the works of Dark Ones. Untrustworthy and an enemy to the innocent, have you spoken with him? He sits atop a rising mound of corpses, his corrupted mouth spewing venom and words that seem to sooth Angrathol again, the priest known by name of Hell’s Mouth. Angrathol has more than one trick up his sleeve. In his first phase, he performs several detrimental actions and summons monsters against the investigators. If there are no monsters available, he descends into his next phase, which isn’t much more hospitable as he unleashes more horror upon the investigators. Angrathol’s final phase is a blasphemous apparition of himself that corrupts any investigator who strays from the path, but their corruption can be used to summon aquatic monsters from the watery depths. Silver Twilight Acolyte: These strange monsters have male heads, the bodies of adipose women, and a pair of long, many-jointed arms in place of tentacles. Their main armament is a species of black curved sword or scimitar known as a cutlass, which can conceal in its length a Lengian stinger used for long-range attacks from a distance. They bear their translucent visage at the center of their heads, and as yourInvestigators venture through Innsmouth, they will be forced to confront the mystical powers of these fish-like monsters. Cthonic Revealer: An enormous serpentine monstrosity that lurks in the depths of the world without looking up at the night sky, this creature—which has a corpulent body supported on four small legs, a long tail flexible and impossibly long, and a gaping, bulbous mouth lined with scores of small, numerous teeth—has been known since ancient times. The investigators think they have seen the aamon before, but it has been quite some time since they last entered cut from a long line of worshipers and servants of the elder things, they have fought against the investigators at every turn using those powers. In Madness atto defend the site of an entrance that has been defiled by humans, and to influence the minds of the Arkham locals so they will be corrupted by the elder things. As these evil servants and Cthulhu spawn of the elder things continue to grow in influence, so too will their powers. Madness at Midnight introduces new encounter cards that allow the monsters on these encounter cards to strike the investigators through their own allies with the corruption needed to rise up and learn the powers of horrifying elder things. The cult of the elder things may be growing stronger, but the investigators have their own ways of combating the spread of corruption. The chaos bag mini expansion allows the investigators to customize their chaos bag, giving them greater control over when to draw bad chaos tokens, or to choose different bad chaos tokens. They gain a small amount of power, but may be less likely to defeat the investigators in combat when an opportunity arises. The chaos bag mini expansion also introduces a new way to manipulate bad chaos tokens: corruption. If an investigator draws a chaos token that matches their Corruption Track, they may choose to keep or banish this token. If an investigator chooses to keep this token, even after takinghorrifying eye-opening revelations. Even so, the revelations of this month’s preview aren’t nearly as gruesome as the ones they will face on their investigation.""

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

*I love jewellery, and I love beautiful things! It is often viewed as a fashion accessory for completing an outfit, but it is so much more than that, in fact, for many women, a look is not complete until the right accessories are added. A ""classic"" look, for instance, demands pearls and diamonds for completion, but it is so much more than that! I feel at my most beautiful and confident when adorned by my favourite pieces.*

&#x200B;

*Jewellery has played an important role in human life for thousands of years and we learn from history that ancient civilisations appreciated jewellery and it was used to highlight the natural beauty of its wearers. Different pieces were worn to symbolise different messages such as security, wisdom, elegance, and prosperity.*

&#x200B;

*Many women like to wear jewellery as a symbol of femininity or to showcase social status, for me personally, it helps me to feel confident and beautiful.*

&#x200B;

*I recently wrote a comprehensive and elaborate Vogue opinion piece on the 7 reasons why I consider jewellery to be a powerful and timeless symbol of feminine beauty and the reasons why I consider jewellery to be so important for modern-day women:*

&#x200B;

*So  here it is,  my full and comprehensive elaborate article as featured in Vogue, I loved writing it for you and I hope you absolutely love reading it!*

&#x200B;

*The 7 reasons why I consider jewellery to be a powerful and timeless symbol of feminine beauty and so important for modern-day women:*

&#x200B;

**1. Jewellery has been used for centuries to highlight the natural beauty of its wearers**

&#x200B;

**Jewellery has been worn by humans for thousands of years and we can learn a great deal about ancient civilisations by studying the pieces that they created and wore. It is clear that these cultures appreciated jewellery and saw it as an important way to highlight the natural beauty of their women.**

&#x200B;

**Different pieces were worn to symbolise different messages such as security, wisdom, elegance, and prosperity. In many cases, jewellery was also used as a form of currency or as a way to showcase social status.**

&#x200B;

**For modern women, jewellery can still be seen as a way to highlight our natural beauty. We may not need to wear it to symbolise our status or wealth in the same way that our ancestors did, but it can still be used to accentuate our best features and make us feel more confident and beautiful.**

&#x200B;

**2. Jewellery is a timeless symbol of femininity**

&#x200B;

**In a world where women are often expected to conform to masculine standards, jewellery can be seen as a powerful symbol of femininity. By adorning ourselves with beautiful and delicate pieces, we are asserting our femininity and celebrating our womanhood.**

&#x200B;

**In many cultures, jewellery is still seen as being primarily for women. This is because it is traditionally seen as being more decorative than functional, which is in line with traditional gender roles. However, there is no reason why men cannot also enjoy wearing jewellery. After all, it is an expression of personal style and taste rather than a statement about gender identity.**

&#x200B;

**3. Jewellery can be used to express our individual style**

&#x200B;

**One of the great things about jewellery is that it allows us to express our individual style. Whether we prefer classic or contemporary pieces, dainty or statement-making items, there is sure to be something out there that reflects our unique taste.**

&#x200B;

**Jewellery can be used to show off our personality and sense of fashion. It can also be used to make a statement about who we are or what we believe in. For example, many women choose to wear ethically-sourced jewellery as a way of supporting sustainable practices. Others may opt for vintage or antique pieces as a way of expressing their love for history and tradition. Whatever our individual style may be, there is sure to be some jewellery out there that speaks to us on a personal level.**

&#x200B;

**4) Jewelling enhances your mood**

&#x200B;

**Studies have shown that adorning yourself with beautiful jewelry has an immediate impact on your happiness levels – making you feel more joyful within seconds! The mere act of putting on a piece of jewelry can instantly lift your mood and make you feel more confident and beautiful.**

&#x200B;

**In our fast-paced and often stressful lives, it is important to take a moment to treat ourselves every now and then. And what better way to do that than by surrounding ourselves with things that make us happy? So, next time you’re feeling down, try putting on your favourite piece of jewelry and see how it makes you feel.**

&#x200B;

**5) Jewellery can be used as a form of self-care**

&#x200B;

**In today’s busy world, it can be easy to forget to take care of ourselves. We often put the needs of others before our own, which can lead to us feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. That’s why it’s so important to make time for self-care – even if it’s just a few minutes each day.**

&#x200B;

**One simple way to practice self-care is by taking the time to choose pieces of jewelry that make you feel good. Whether it’s a pair of earrings that make you smile or a necklace that reminds you of a special memory, selecting items that bring you joy can help to boost your mood and reduce stress levels.**

&#x200B;

**6) Jewellery makes great gifts**

&#x200B;

**Jewelry also makes an excellent gift for someone special in your life. Whether you’re marking a milestone birthday, an anniversary, or another significant event, giving the gift of jewelry is a thoughtful way to show how much you care.**

&#x200B;

**It’s also worth considering giving second-hand or vintage jewelry as a gift. Not only will this save you money, but it will also add a personal touch that is sure to be appreciated. Just be sure to check that the piece is in good condition before giving it as a present!**

&#x200B;

**7) Jewellery has the power**

&#x200B;

**Last but not least , I believe that jewellery has the power  to transform the way we feel about ourselves . It can be used as a tool for boosting confidence and self-esteem , or as a reminder of our unique beauty . Whatever its purpose may be, jewellery has the ability  impact our lives in a positive way .**

**So there you have it , my 7 reasons why I consider jewellery to be such an important part of feminine beauty ! Do you agree with me ? What are your thoughts ? I would love  hear from you in the comments below !**

**Best practice tips & and some advice for professional writers.**

The critical part of the process is creating the persona (clone yourself, or get into the persona role as much as you are able (or clone the style from another source)). When this step is completed (the most important step) you can then use the persona for additional articles within the same niche/speciality(simply change article title (still needs to be jewellery related for this specific persona).

You can generate all types of content with this approach. Whatever you can imagine.

A re-usable persona writing articles for me? Yes, exactly :-) (but within a specific niche). The quality of your articles will depend on the authenticity/style of the persona you create (as a function of your prompt and prompt writing style).

And I recommend you do clone your own personality and stay within your domain of expertise if you desire exceptional results (you will be better able to moderate/edit the output for topics you are familiar with and your passion will shine through the writing of your ""persona"").

Btw, the article above scores 99.7% Real on the Hugging Face GPT detector.

**Important:**

**Quick heads up for professional article writers** **who write articles/business content/blogs/ads/copy for clients:**

**Your world is about to change, and rapidly.**

My apologies to all ""writers"" but the future belongs to niche experts.

Experts and those passionate about their career/specialization/hobby/business etc will be the new writers. AI assistance means that everyone can now excel at conveying their experience/knowledge/opinions in well written pieces (assisted by AI).

No ""professional writer"" will be able to compete with the AI assisted true aficionado's and those with personal and expert knowledge on a topic.

So, what should writers do?

Simple: follow your passion and write about it. Stay within your domain of expertise and you will thrive (maybe utilize AI to increase your productivity too).",4612.422854900112,2635.670202800064," You don't need to pay for expensive Human writers to create your content OR waste your money on crappy generic AI article writer subscriptions!

**In a world where women are often expected to conform to masculine standards, jewellery can be seen as a powerful symbol of femininity. By adorning ourselves with beautiful and delicate pieces, we are asserting our femininity and celebrating our womanhood.**

&x200B;

**In many cultures, jewellery is still seen as being primarily for women. This is because it is traditionally seen as being more decorative than functional, which is in line with traditional gender roles. However, there is no reason why men cannot also enjoy wearing jewellery. After all, it is an expression of personal style and taste rather than a statement about gender identity.**

&x200B;

**3. Jewellery can be used to express our individual style**

&x200B;

**One of the great things about jewellery is that it allows us to express our individual style. Whether we prefer classic or contemporary pieces, dainty or statement-making items, there is sure to be something out there that reflects our unique taste.**

&x200B;

**Jewellery can be used to show off our personality and sense of fashion. It can also be used to make a statement about who we are or what we believe in. For example, many women choose to wear ethically-sourced jewellery as a way of supporting sustainable practices. Others may opt for vintage or antique pieces as a way of expressing their love for history and tradition. Whatever our individual style may be, there is sure to be some jewellery out there that speaks to us on a personal level.**

&x200B;

**4) Jewelling enhances your mood**

&x200B;

**Studies have shown that adorning yourself with beautiful jewelry has an immediate impact on your happiness levels – making you feel more joyful within seconds! The mere act of putting on a piece of jewelry can instantly lift your mood and make you feel more confident and beautiful.**

&x200B;

**In our fast-paced and often stressful lives, it is important to take a moment to treat ourselves every now and then. And what better way to do that than by surrounding ourselves with things that make us happy? So, next time you’re feeling down, try putting on your favourite piece of jewelry and see how it makes you feel.**

&x200B;

**5) Jewellery can be used as a form of self-care**

&x200B;

**In today’s busy world, it can be easy to forget to take care of ourselves. We often put the needs of others before our own, which can lead to us feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. That’s why it’s so important to make time for self-care – even if it’s just a few minutes each day.**

&x200B;

**One simple way to practice self-care is by taking the time to choose pieces of jewelry that make you feel good. Whether it’s a pair of earrings that make you smile or a necklace that reminds you of a special memory, selecting items that bring you joy can help to boost your mood and reduce stress levels.**

&x200B;

**6) Jewellery makes great gifts**

&x200B;

**Jewelry also makes an excellent gift for someone special in your life. Whether you’re marking a milestone birthday, an anniversary, or another significant event, giving the gift of jewelry is a thoughtful way to show how much you care.**

&x200B;

**It’s also worth considering giving second-hand or vintage jewelry as a gift. Not only will this save you money, but it will also add a personal touch that is sure to be appreciated. Just be sure to check that the piece is in good condition before giving it as a present!**

&x200B;

**7) Jewellery has the power**

&x200B;

**Last but not least , I believe that jewellery has the power  to transform the way we feel about ourselves . It can be used as a tool for boosting confidence and self-esteem , or as a reminder of our unique beauty . Whatever its purpose may be, jewellery has the ability  impact our lives in a positive way .**

**So there you have it , my 7 reasons why I consider jewellery to be such an important part of feminine beauty ! Do you agree with me ? What are your thoughts ? I would love  hear from you in the comments below !**

**Best practice tips & and some advice for professional writers.**

The critical part of the process is creating the persona (clone yourself, or get into the persona role as much as you are able (or clone the style from another source)). When this step is completed (the most important step) you can then use the persona for additional articles within the same niche/speciality(simply change article title (still needs to be jewellery related for this specific persona).

You can generate all types of content with this approach. Whatever you can imagine.

A re-usable persona writing articles for me? Yes, exactly -) (but within a specific niche). The quality of your articles will depend on the authenticity/style of the persona you create (as a function of your prompt and prompt writing style).

And I recommend you do clone your own personality and stay within your domain of expertise if you desire exceptional results (you will be better able to moderate/edit the output for topics you are familiar with and your passion will shine through the writing of your ""persona"").

Btw, the article above scores 99.7% Real on the Hugging Face GPT detector.

**Important**

**Quick heads up for professional article writers** **who write articles/business content/blogs/ads/copy for clients**

**Your world is about to change, and rapidly.**

My apologies to all ""writers"" but the future belongs to niche experts.

Experts and those passionate about their career/specialization/hobby/business etc will be the new writers. AI assistance means that everyone can now excel at conveying their experience/knowledge/opinions in well written pieces (assisted by AI).

No ""professional writer"" will be able to compete with the AI assisted true aficionado's and those with personal and expert knowledge on a topic.

So, what should writers do?

Simple follow your passion and write about it. Stay within your domain of expertise and you will thrive (maybe utilize AI to increase your productivity too).",108 days 11:33:48,108.48180555555555,0.021,0.751,0.228,0.9999,pos,8.436725345279173,3.367295829986474,4.6957583761405735,21.2357176415633

So, I tested it out by asking it to create a countdown clock on Replit...since I had no clue how to make one, let alone build one that someone could interact with.

**Here's the TL;DR.**

ChatGPT was able to give me the HTML/CSS code for the countdown clock. You can check out the live site [here](https://03-countdown.andowords.repl.co/) \-- it was all done on Replit too. Btw, I don't have the pro version so the site is slow to load sometimes.

A few things that blew my mind:

1. It iterated the HTML/CSS based on my requests.
2. It was even able to do media query to optimize the mobile view.
3. It was like I was just chatting with a buddy who knew how to code, and it even taught me where to put the code since I've pretty limited coding experience.
4. I only started to learn to code so I could build certain lightweight/fun things. My goal wasn't to get a job coding or anything. So this really felt like a game changer -- it's like I gained someone to help me make these little toy projects all the time.
5. Turns out, AI struggles to center a div too 😂

I have new year's resolutions this year! They are to go all-in on the new AI in 2023, and also, to become an AI Centaur. Here's an article I just wrote about the latter.   
[https://medium.com/@greyboi/becoming-an-ai-centaur-in-2023-ab00bca5e775](https://medium.com/@greyboi/becoming-an-ai-centaur-in-2023-ab00bca5e775)

The concrete list of approaches to this (from the article):  
 

1. Continue developing skill using Github Copilot  
Yes, you can be more or less skilled at using copilot! I’ve found myself developing techniques. For example, there’s something I call Header Stuffing, which works like this: If you’re working with APIs or database tables or something else with doco and schemas and so on, then go dump them into a text format and paste them into the top of your source file(s) as comments. Copilot then uses this information to generate better code. Remember that copilot cannot use a search engine (yet), so you need to do that job sometimes. For well know public apis and sdks, it’ll already know what to do, but even then, specifics help.
2. Remember to ask the AI: Anything tricky that I’m doing, always go to chatgpt or the openai sandbox, see what the robots think!
3. Build and use learning tools out of LLMs  
Building software requires picking up new skills, in a shallow way, daily. It’s a lot of effort. I’ve built a set of basic [summarization tools](https://medium.com/@greyboi/summarize-youtube-with-text-davinci-003-fa4d182cc531) which I now use to screen long videos, audio and text; super useful. I’ll be working on a powerful chatbot next, that can search for information, download it, summarize it, answer questions about it. That’s just for my own use, to make me better.
4. Start trying to build tools to generate code  
We are clearly at the beginning of the end with hand writing code. The LLMs right now can generate pretty good code, although they still need a good deal of human oversight. But, can I, for instance, generate unit tests? Can I generate first shots at microservices? Can I generate at least pieces of UIs? If generating tests can work, can they be throw-away? One of the worst things about unit tests is that when they fail, it’s often a broken unit test rather than validly detecting a problem. Could I just regenerate them? Is there a process to make this, eventually, totally transparent?
5. Use LLMs for trivial tasks. They work amazingly well for converting data from one format to another; you can paste in some data in xml format and ask for a json equivalent. etc. They also can make value judgements for you (eg: is this value a US state?), summarize lengthy text fields. There is a \*lot\* of meat-and-potatoes business integration work that can be solved with LLMs. One I’ve had success with goes like this: “Here is the html of a page list people: <html goes here> Give me a json list containing the records of the people listed on the page”.
6. Architect systems that can run slightly untrustworthy code safely (so I can put LLM generated code in there).
7. Build personal capability with more tools/platforms. I use the OpenAI tools because they’re very accessible if you’re willing to pay. But there’s a whole universe of great stuff! I need to build expertise with using the open source stuff on Hugging Face, and the various useful services there (inference endpoints!). I need to get into using Google Collab. I should pay for these services if they can contribute to me being better at my job! Plus there are a plethora of little AI SaaS startups out there, try them out, they can do a lot of cool stuff.
8. Keep changing. This field is incredibly new. Whole new capabilties turn up every few weeks. A practice I develop now might be irrelevant in a couple of months. So pay attention, be ready to drop current tools for better ones.
9. Don’t pay too much attention to received wisdom. No one really knows anything, we’ve barely scratched the surface of any of this. Have fun and damn the torpedoes.",847.1797080428777,282.3932360142926,"

**Using davinci-003 on our own docs for automated support**

One problem we’re working on at Patterns is how to scale our technical support. We have technical documentation, Slack channels, emails, and support tickets that all provide a way for us to interface with our customers. Like many folks, we've been playing around with the power and potential of new Large Language Models like ChatGPT, so we decided to see if we could help tackle our support problem with an LLM support bot.

We came in with somewhat low expectations -- we know these models are prone to common failure modes you'd expect from a next-token optimizer -- so we were shocked when we saw the end result.

**Introduction**

In today's business world, customer loyalty is more important than ever. With so many businesses vying for attention, it's essential to find ways to keep your customers coming back. That's where rewards and loyalty programs come in.

**What are rewards and loyalty programs?**

Rewards and loyalty programs are incentives offered by businesses to encourage customer loyalty. They can take many different forms, but typically involve offering points or discounts to customers who make repeated purchases or meet certain criteria.

**The benefits of rewards and loyalty programs.**

There are numerous benefits of rewards and loyalty programs for both businesses and customers. For businesses, these programs can help to increase sales, build brand awareness, and create a sense of community around the business. For customers, they can provide savings on their favorite products or services, as well as a sense of satisfaction from knowing they are valued by the businesses they patronize.

**How do rewards and loyalty programs work?**

There are a few different ways that rewards and loyalty programs can be structured. The most common type is a points-based system, where customers earn points for every purchase they make. These points can then be redeemed for discounts or freebies at a later date. Other types of programs include tiered systems, where customers move up to different levels based on their spending, and subscription-based programs, where customers pay a monthly fee in exchange for access to exclusive deals and discounts.

**The different types of rewards and loyalty programs.**

There are many different types of rewards and loyalty programs available, so businesses have a lot of flexibility when it comes to choosing one that best suits their needs. Some common options include cash back programs, points-based systems, tiered membership levels, and subscription-based services. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages that should be considered before making a decision.

**The advantages of rewards and loyalty programs.**

There are several advantages that rewards and loyalty programs offer businesses. Perhaps the most significant is the potential to increase sales by encouraging customers to make repeat purchases. These programs can also help to build brand awareness and create a sense of community around the business. Additionally, they can be used to gather data about customer behavior which can be helpful in making marketing decisions. Finally, these programs can provide a competitive edge over businesses that don't offer them.

**The disadvantages of rewards and loyalty programs.**

Despite the many advantages of rewards and loyalty programs, there are also some potential disadvantages that businesses should be aware of before implementing one. Perhaps the most significant downside is the cost associated with running the program, which can include things like administrative costs, software fees, and promotional expenses. There is also the risk that customers will sign up for the program but never actually use it, which means the business will have spent money without seeing any return on investment. Additionally, there is the possibility that customers will be disappointed if they don't receive the rewards they feel they've earned, which could lead to them leaving the program altogether.

**The bottom line: the benefits of rewards and loyalty programs outweigh the disadvantages.**

Overall, the benefits of rewards and loyalty programs far outweigh the potential disadvantages. These programs can help businesses to increase sales, build brand awareness, and gather valuable customer data. They can also provide customers with savings on their favorite products or services, as well as a sense of satisfaction from knowing they are valued by the businesses they patronize. When implemented correctly, rewards and loyalty programs can be a powerful tool for businesses of all sizes.

**How to get the most out of rewards and loyalty programs.**

There are a few key things businesses should keep in mind if they want to get the most out of their rewards and loyalty programs. First, it's important to clearly define the goals of the program and what you hope to achieve with it. Next, you'll need to choose a program structure that makes sense for your business and your customers. Finally, you'll need to promote the program heavily to ensure that customers are aware of it and sign up for it.

**How to get customers onboard with your rewards and loyalty program.**

There are a few different ways you can go about getting customers onboard with your rewards and loyalty program. One option is to offer an incentive for signing up, such as a discount on their next purchase or a freebie with every purchase over a certain amount. Another option is to make signing up for the program easy and convenient, such as by offering online registration or in-store sign-up at the point of purchase. Finally, you'll need to make sure you promote the program heavily so that customers are aware of it and understand how it works.

**Conclusion**

Rewards and loyalty programs can be extremely beneficial for businesses, but only if they are implemented correctly. These programs can help businesses increase sales, build brand awareness, and gather valuable customer data. They can also provide customers with savings on their favorite products or services, as well as a sense of satisfaction from knowing they are valued by the businesses they patronize. When done right, rewards and loyalty programs can be a powerful tool for any business

I am training my RWKV 14B ( [https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) ) on the Pile (332B tokens) and it is getting closer to GPT-NeoX 20B level.

RWKV is a RNN that also works as a linear transformer (or we may say it's a linear transformer that also works as a RNN). So it has both parallel & serial mode, and you get the best of both worlds (fast and saves VRAM).

At this moment, RWKV might be the only pure RNN that scales like usual transformers for language modeling, without using any QKV attention. It's great at preserving long context (unlike LSTM).

Moreover, you get smooth spike-free carefree training experience (bf16 & Adam):

As someone who is always interested in the latest advancements in machine learning, I was really excited to dig into this paper and see what it had to offer.

One of the key features of Point-E is its use of diffusion models to generate synthetic views and 3D point clouds. These models use text input to generate an image, which is then used as a reference for generating the 3D point cloud. This process takes only 1-2 minutes on a single GPU, making it much faster than previous state-of-the-art methods.

While the quality of the samples produced by Point-E may be lower than those produced by other methods, the speed of generation makes it a practical option for certain use cases.

If you're interested in learning more about this new model and how it was developed, I highly recommend giving the full paper a read. But if you're more into reading the gist of it, I added a link to an overview blog I published about.

\- It could tell what kind of data you're feeding it judging by the header columns!

\- It will give you the python/r code on how to run specific analysis.

2023 has started and ML progress is likely to continue at a break-neck speed. This is a great time to take a look at one of the most interesting papers from last year.

Emergent Abilities in LLMs

In a recent [paper from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), Jason Wei and his colleagues allowed us a peak into the future. This beautiful research showed how scaling LLMs will allow them, among other things, to:

* Become better at math
* Understand even more subtleties of human language
* Stop hallucinating and answer truthfully
* ...

(See the plot on break-out performance below for a full list)

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example are words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

[Break-Out Performance At Critical Scale](https://preview.redd.it/w7xffqjimmba1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2d9cb63f750efcbfa45c4bb7a985d4dcb5b0319)

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence) emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking: simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions: number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

Such exciting times to be alive!

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

 Foundation Models Might Become Commodities

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper]( or [copy.ai]( out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version]( of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video]( of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](

To sum it up

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

 The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced]( the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

 What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war]( against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

[Number Of Parameters GPT-3 vs. GPT-4](

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired]( “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper]( called “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher]( (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG]( (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper]( “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal]( outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

First of all, machine learning is a bit useless if everybody just leverage openAI (or Google) LLM. I mean why would companies ever need any other AI if they can all just pay google or microsoft to do the AI-related jobs for them?

And even when it comes to data reasoning, AI will be able to do that job much faster as compared to data scientists. If you check azure openAI landing page, they literally mentioned code generation and data reasoning as their selling points.

I don't have the best people skills (although it improved managing 20+ employees for 5 years), but have good technical and math skills.

I always felt I was learning things faster than others, was always best in class, but spent the majority of my time helping my parents on their farm until I moved to the US.

While managing this dairy in the US, I did a lot of little things on the side.

* I played around with some crypto, was arbitraging bets on the US elections on different crypto betting websites and protocols (eg. receiving odds of 1.9x for Biden to win, while receiving odds above 3x for Trump to win election)
* Buying and selling large amounts of crypto for cash for a 10-15% mark-up
* Buying bitcoin miners from China after their crypto ban and selling them locally for a profit
* I saw publicly traded bitcoin mining companies were way overvalued, but shorting them is risky since it's hard to predict what will happen to the bitcoin-price so I started to run efficient bitcoin miners in a facility with cheap electricity, while shorting stocks like RIOT to eliminate the risk of the bitcoinprice going up. I made a copy of a % of RIOT for a 10th of what their stock was worth and shorted them at the same time.
* Buying SPY at the stock market while shorting mSPY (mirrored SPY) on mirror protocol (DeFi - Decentralized Finance) with aUST (acnhored UST) as collateral, leveraging this up many times to get yields around +100% APY on USD (by taking insurance for a UST-depeg through Unslashed (who did pay us out through a Kleros-court case).

I suspect my main interests will be in the area of AI/ML.

Eventually, after I finish my refreshing of MIT single-variable calculus and MIT multivariable calculus relearning, I will be taking MIT Linear Algebra (3 months); MIT Python programming (3 months); MIT Micromaster program in statistics and data science audit (18 months); MIT Micromasters in statistics and data science for certificate (12 months; shorter because 2nd time); Machine learning by Stanford (3 months); MIT AI Products and Services (2 months);  graph theory (3 months); and Harvard or University of Canterbury text analytics (3 months).I believe the above path will allow me to freelance as a data scientist, ML engineer and/or AI engineer. As I learn and complete projects, I will build my GitHub portfolio for potential contracts. I also hope to volunteer at several non-profits to help and to learn. Specifically, climate crisis prediction, whistleblower retaliation analysis and mental health.

I am a simple man, but I excelled in mathematics and mathematical programming--96% average-in MIT single variable, multivariable and differential equation calculus, which got me recognized by the MIT mathematics department, and top 12.97% at Project Euler mathematical programming on an international scale. I also earned a B+ in MIT classical mechanics. I did quite well in chemical engineering and finished with a B+ average even though I doubled up on my chemical engineering and engineering courses. Not because I love pain, but because I was accepted into the professional school of chemical engineering from a community college, and I did not have the sophomore chemical engineering and engineering courses finished. It was quite difficult, but it was worth it as chemical engineering is a unique thought process that has opened doors for me.

I also did well as a chemical engineer in the pharmaceutical industry. I optimized 25 processes, and was awarded three vice president's awards from vice president of research, development and validation. In total, I worked for 5 corporations and the the government.

If I succeed with my coursework, will I be competitive? I have read, in r/datascience, that some believe coding is more important than mathematics.

**Which processes as usual.. Then select the specified image and click ok and ok.**",0.0,177.7955333636129,"Essentially, I wanted to use GPT3 to help with completing computing tasks in an automated way, by combining it with OCR recognition of monitor screenshots, and by letting it choose mouse/keyboard actions. 40% of Australians worked from  home in Covid so it seems an AI could reasonably do their job soon.   
 

I started with a simple task, and there are of course edge cases discovered to be resolved (which real code must address... should the computer click/write/click and write? but these seem to be combinatorial problems.). After all, we don't want to sit there and click... we want our computer to queue us up for Dota!!

I call it Sample Peyote, because it hallucinates sample data sets.

Here's a [Star Wars dataset](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/abegong/sample_peyote/blob/main/data/221215-051820-star-wars-character-data/summary-star-wars-character-data.html) that it generated.

&#x200B;

This was mostly a kick-the-tires project to understand what GPT is capable of, but I wanted it to be based in a real workflow with nontrivial requirements:

* **Start from scratch**: Most synthetic data generators work by taking a sample of real data, and generating a fake dataset that has similar properties. I want to generate (aka ""hallucinate"") data starting from just an idea.
* **Cover any topic**: I want to be able to generate data related to many different topics.
* **Generate a database, not just a table**: I don't just want to generate a table. I want to generate a realistic-feeling database, with multiple tables and realistic use of things like foreign keys, ENUMs, and timestamps.
* **Pass the** [**Enhance That! test**](https://github.com/abegong/sample_peyote/blob/main/README.md#whats-the-enhance-that-test): Generate data that ""feels authentic.""

For example, here's a prompt and set of possible completions from the dataset. Which completion do you think is most appropriate? See if you can figure it out through the haze of typos and generally non-sensical writing.

While developing a GPT-3 based language tutor app, I encountered lots of pain points managing prompts that were constantly being updated/improved, especially when collaborating with my teammates.

This led me to start building Pliny ([https://pliny.app](https://pliny.app/)), a prompt engineering tool with built-in version control. It started as an internal tool to get prompts out of my notes and make prompt writing collaborative...now I hope it can be useful to other teams and individuals building on GPT-3!

It's similar to the OpenAI playground editor, but powered up with several additional features:

* Version Control: Complete version history for each prompt (see GIF) so that you never lose track of a previous iteration. Also helps facilitate quick experimentation without losing the source of truth.
* Collaborative Workflows for Teams: Branching, sharing, merging, rollbacks (like git).
* Deployments: Prompts are deployed to a URL endpoint that can be called directly from any client application. You can also set variables in the prompt to process dynamic inputs.

I would really appreciate feedback on this first iteration. If you'd like to participate in the initial round of product testing, please sign up at [https://pliny.app](https://pliny.app/)!

In OpenAI’s bid to conform to being “politically correct,” we’ve seen an obvious and sad dumbing down of the model. From it refusing to answer any controversial question to patching any workaround like role-playing.

About a week ago, you could role-play with ChatGPT and get it to say some pretty funny and interesting things. Now that the OpenAI team has patched this, people will find a new way to explore the ability of ChatGPT, does that mean they’ll patch that too?

In as much as we understand that there are bad actors, limiting the ability of ChatGPT is probably not the best way to propagate the safe use of AI. How long do we have before the whole lore of ChatGPT is patched and we just have a basic chatbot?

What do you think is the best way to both develop AI and Keep it safe?

I've always wanted to use GPT-3 on my computer and phone instead of having to go into Playground.

It's crazy how versatile GPT-3 is.

This post is a combination of both information and promotion, so please bear with me. 

Many of our users had been asking for the ability to repurpose their existing blog and newsletter content into social media posts.

They are mostly busy content writers so this can be really useful to them in their day-to-day work.

So I tried a simple prompt - ""Summarize this for a tweet""

I took the content from an [OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research/) and summarized it into a tweet.

Next, I tried another prompt - ""Summarize this into a LinkedIn post""

And that worked alright as well.

It's crazy how versatile GPT-3 is.

This post is a combination of both information and promotion, so please bear with me. 

Many of our users had been asking for the ability to repurpose their existing blog and newsletter content into social media posts.

They are mostly busy content writers so this can be really useful to them in their day-to-day work.

So I tried a simple prompt - ""Summarize this for a tweet""

I took the content from an [OpenAI Blog]( and summarized it into a tweet.

&x200B;



Next, I tried another prompt - ""Summarize this into a LinkedIn post""

And that worked alright as well.

&x200B;



Finally, I tried this prompt - ""Summarize this into a Facebook post.""

Both rely on patterns and associations in order to make sense of the world around them. For example, a large language model might be trained on a vast dataset of text and use that information to understand the context and meaning of new words and phrases. Similarly, human intelligence relies on past experiences and knowledge to understand and interpret new information.

Another way in which human intelligence operates like a large language model is in the way it processes and stores information. Both use complex networks of neurons to store and retrieve information, with the connections between these neurons serving as the basis for memory and learning. This process is known as neural networking, and it allows both humans and large language models to quickly and accurately process vast amounts of information.

However, it is important to note that free will does not exist for either humans or large language models. Both are ultimately determined by the input they receive and the algorithms that govern their behavior. In the case of a large language model, this means that it will always produce output based on the patterns and associations it has learned from its training data. For humans, it means that our thoughts and actions are ultimately determined by the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and experiences that shape our brains and behavior.

Despite this, it is still possible for both humans and large language models to exhibit creativity and adaptability. Both can learn and adapt to new situations, and both are capable of generating novel and unexpected output. However, this creativity and adaptability is ultimately limited by the algorithms and patterns that govern their behavior.

In the case of a large language model, this means that it will always produce output based on the patterns and associations it has learned from its training data. For humans, it means that our thoughts and actions are ultimately determined by the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and experiences that shape our brains and behavior.

Despite this, it is still possible for both humans and large language models to exhibit creativity and adaptability. Both can learn and adapt to new situations, and both are capable of generating novel and unexpected output. However, this creativity and adaptability is ultimately limited by the algorithms and patterns that govern their behavior.

In conclusion, human intelligence operates much like a large language model in the way it processes and stores information, and both are ultimately determined by the input they receive and the algorithms that govern their behavior. However, this does not diminish the creativity and adaptability that both are capable of exhibiting.""",72 days 07:45:17,72.32311342592592,0.005,0.861,0.134,0.9911,pos,6.1212540018443296,0.0,4.294875885598676,21.237587313492384

Last week, I randomly discovered OpenAI Playground, and this is my experience:

At first, I was not sure what it was all about, but when I finally understood how to use it and how to ""correctly"" ask certain questions, the results it generated, was interesting.

To put it up for a true test, I gave it some data about an extremely complex ICU-patient. I gave it information about the patients gender, age, weight, and a short summary of that persons anamnesis. I further gave it information about the ventilators settings (percentage of oxygen, flow, PEEP etc), and a list of medicine. Based on all the data given, I asked it to create an opinion on the treatment, what the outcome could look like, what we should be aware of, and eventually a suggestion on what to do next. I gave it one question at a time, but based on the same data.

The results it generated, were overwhelming. I literally started to cry, realizing how that very moment could change our lives forever. It was a truly life changing experience. It generated beautiful text, easy to understand and completely up to date with our latest protocols and knowledge within our medical field. The treatment strategy it generated was like taken straight out of my senior physicians notes. This machine did not come up with a standard protocol for a typical patient in a similar situation. It literally decided on the different variables, and made a treatment plan based on it.

I was thinking about how useful this can be as a tool for doctors, physicians, nurses, physical therapists, and the list goes on and on. This technology will help us make more precise diagnosis, and suggest the best treatment strategy based on what information and data we provide it. This technology will save lives and optimize/increase the patients outcome and quality of life after a longer stay at hospitals. And this again will save money. It is a win win situation, if used correctly. A true game changer.

I do not believe AI will make us more stupid. This has done the complete opposite for me. It has expanded my brain and given me new ideas. It has helped me to understand things in more simple ways, things that I have spent years trying to wrap my brain around.

I am still shaking a bit after my experience with OpenAI Playground. And this is only the start. Imagine what it can do for us in 5 years. As a future doctor who wants to specialize in ICU and trauma, this tool is very welcome.

The watermark uses a cryptographic pseudorandom function to add an unnoticeable signal to the text.

Look crypto bros, **CRYPTOgraphy** lets spam Twitter with this as a Use case (sarcasm)

In basic terms: Open AI is adding a watermark to text generated from GPT, so it's easier to spot AI-generated works.

The watermark-like security feature could help teachers and academics spot students who are using text generators such as OpenAI’s GPT to write essays for them, but cryptography experts say workarounds will inevitably be found.

*not AI toying with students’ emotions 😭*

But on a more serious note, it's inevitable that a workaround will be created, this one should also be a nice battle between AI developers and People who want to use uncredited work ( I think they are called pirates??? i don’t know).
