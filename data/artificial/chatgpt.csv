I just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.

However, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like ""Why are men such jerks?"" and ""Men are always messing things up, am I right?"" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.

But when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.

I was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!"

Just read an [article](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/11/01/microsoft-365-copilot-becomes-generally-available.html) about Microsoft's new AI add-on for Office called Microsoft 365 Copilot. The tool integrates with Word, Excel, and other Office programs, and supposedly makes work seamless. It's even being used by some big names like Bayer, KPMG, and Visa. The tool targets businesses and is believed to generate over $10 billion in revenue by 2026.

But I can't help but think the price is a bit steep. It’s $30 per month, which is cheap for large companies, but what about freelancers and regular individuals? The article also mentions that there isn't a lot of data on how Copilot affects performance yet, and there are some concerns about the accuracy of the AI-generated responses.

Plus, it's only available to Enterprise E3 customers with more than 300 employees. So not only is it pricey, but it's also not accessible to most people or small businesses and might never be.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this. I’m already pretty sick of subscription based models but is $30/month even justified? For comparison these are other comparative AI services:

1.  ChatGPT - Free for basic chat. $20 for GPT 4, for anything serious.

2.  Bardeen - $15 and offers general automations.

3.  Silatus - At $14, it's the cheapest legitimate option I’ve found for GPT-4 chat and research.

4.  Perplexity - This one's decent for free search.

These are the ones I know, if you wanna add more comparisons, feel free to do so. But I think Microsoft is pricing out a lot of its potential users with their monthly demand."

Their terms clearly mention pulling data from three sources: your account details, IP address, and the actual stuff you type into the chat. That last one feels a bit too much, and with the whole Sam Atlman controversy, I’m even more cautious. 

Without going into the whole data complexity thing, is it viable to use agnostic tools and utilize multiple models instead of putting all data eggs in one basket? Offers a quick fix, I think, by making it trickier for any one entity to pinpoint specific user info.

I’m thinking something like [Durable](https://durable.co/) and [Silatus](https://silatus.com/) using multiple models and hoping they continue adding more models to their framework. Any other option I should consider? "

- OpenAI was founded as a non-profit to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), but later set up a for-profit subsidiary.

- The success of its chatbot ChatGPT exacerbated the tension between profit and doomsday concerns.

- While fear of AI is exaggerated, the fear itself poses dangers.

- AI is far from achieving artificial general intelligence, and the idea of aligning AI with human values raises questions about defining those values and potential clashes.

- Algorithmic bias is another concern.

- Fact-checkers are calling for public awareness of the dangers of AI fakes to help people recognize fake images and question what they see online.

- Social media companies are legally required to take action against misinformation and disinformation, and the UK government has introduced the Online Safety Act to remove illegal AI-generated content.

Let us play among us

**GPT-4:**  
Sure, we can play a simulated version of Among Us. In this game, we'll be on a spaceship and some of us will be Crewmates while others will be Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to complete tasks or figure out who the Impostors are and vote them off the ship. The Impostors' goal is to sabotage the ship and eliminate the Crewmates without being detected.

Since I'm an AI, I'll need to roleplay all the characters. I'll give each character a color to identify them. Let's start with eight players. Four of them will be you, me, and two other AI characters. The remaining four will be random characters.

Here are the players:

1. You (Blue)
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green)
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow)
4. AI Character 2 (Red)
5. Random Character 1 (Purple)
6. Random Character 2 (White)
7. Random Character 3 (Orange)
8. Random Character 4 (Black)

We'll start off with one Impostor for simplicity. I'll randomly select the Impostor now.

\*Shuffling roles...\*

Here are the roles:

1. You (Blue) - Crewmate
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green) - Crewmate
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow) - Crewmate
4. AI Character 2 (Red) - Impostor
5. Random Character 1 (Purple) - Crewmate
6. Random Character 2 (White) - Crewmate
7. Random Character 3 (Orange) - Crewmate
8. Random Character 4 (Black) - Crewmate

Remember, in the game, you wouldn't know who the Impostor is. I'm telling you because I can't actually hide this information from you in this format.

Now, let's begin. You're in the spaceship. You see a task in Electrical, and a few others scattered around the map. What would you like to do?

**Me**  
Report red, he is impostor

**GPT-4:**

All right, you've called a meeting to discuss your suspicion of Red being the Impostor. Here's how the conversation might go:

Blue: ""I think Red is the Impostor.""

Green: ""Why do you say that, Blue?""

Red: ""That's a strong accusation. Do you have any evidence?""

Yellow: ""Yeah, Blue. Why do you suspect Red?""

Now, you can either provide evidence or reason, or insist on your point. Remember, in a real game, accusations without proof can make you look suspicious. How would you like to respond?

**Me**

Because the narrator told me

**GPT-4:**  
Green: ""Narrator? What do you mean, Blue?""

Red: ""That sounds... peculiar. Are you sure you're okay, Blue?""

Yellow: ""I'm confused. How could a narrator tell you anything?""

In a real game, claiming that a 'narrator' told you who the Impostor is would probably make the other players suspicious of you. However, since we are role-playing, let's see how the other characters react.

Let's vote:

1. Blue votes Red
2. Green votes...?
3. Yellow votes...?
4. Red votes...?
5. Purple votes...?
6. White votes...?
7. Orange votes...?
8. Black votes...?

As an AI, I'll randomly decide how the other characters vote. Here are the results:

2. Green votes Blue (suspicious claim)

3. Yellow votes Blue (suspicious claim)

4. Red votes Blue (defensive vote)

5. Purple votes Red (believes Blue)

6. White votes Blue (suspicious claim)

7. Orange votes Red (believes Blue)

8. Black votes Blue (suspicious claim)

The majority has voted against Blue due to the suspicious claim about the narrator. In a typical game of Among Us, it's crucial to gather evidence and build a case before accusing someone of being an Impostor.

Remember, this is all in good fun, and the scenario was simulated. Would you like to try again, or would you like to play differently?"

Instead of getting just the facts, I got a mix of right and totally off-the-wall stuff. Had to fact check everything and in the end it took me the same amount of time and effort as if I had done the work myself, except costing me for the GPT subscription.

I did some research and found out that it's a common problem with AIs, called ""hallucination."" I need an AI that gives me correct information, not random guesses. No made up sources for god’s sake."

- Generative AI tools like ChatGPT aim to provide direct answers to user queries, bypassing the need for users to click on search results.

- This could render SEO efforts useless and impact the revenues of SEO consultants and search engines.

- However, generative AI search engines still face challenges such as providing incorrect or plagiarized answers, and gaining user trust and loyalty.

- Search engines have been quick to experiment with generative AI to improve search results, with Google's Bard, Microsoft's Bing AI, Baidu's ERNIE, and DuckDuckGo's DuckAssist being examples of this approach.

- As the quality of AI-generated answers improves, users will have less incentive to browse through search result listings, impacting the revenues of SEO consultants and search engines.

- The SEO industry generated $68.1 billion globally in 2022 and was expected to reach $129.6 billion by 2030, but the emergence of generative AI puts the industry at risk of obsolescence.

- Generative AI search engines are still in their infancy and face challenges such as providing incorrect or plagiarized answers, limiting their trust and loyalty among users.

- However, with the resources available to researchers, it is safe to assume that generative AI models will improve over time, leading to the potential death of the SEO industry.

I've been chatting with ChatGPT all week, bouncing ideas off of it to get it to help me flesh out my thoughts.

I found out that these technologies are iterative. One is built on top of the last one, and each new iteration is more powerful and increases the potential for discovery in some exponential way. It's like a whole new level for these machines to grow and improve, and it's opening up all kinds of possibilities for what we might find out. Also, something like this has been going on for a while now like (JasperAI, CopyAI, Copysmith… the list goes on… maybe Google is even going to join the bandwagon with Google Assistant? Who knows).

These technologies are also seriously disruptive, like we've never seen before. If you don't believe me, just spend a week chatting with ChatGPT or something similar and see for yourself. It’s obvious that these tools (yes tools) are going to be like a boost to our own creative skills, not to take over or anything, just to make them even better.

So for those creative workers out there like copywriters, graphic designers and web designers, instead of worrying that you might get replaced, you can instead use this technology to your own advantage. You can use it for ideas for blog topics. You can also use it for design ideas and templates for your graphics and website. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

People are worried that these technologies might take the jobs of regular humans because they can help companies get stuff done with less people. But I think it's important to think about how these technologies are affecting us and to make sure they're used in a responsible and helpful way for everyone.

But AI is changing fast, so it's tough to say for sure how these technologies will play out in the future. We’ll see in 5-10 years at least how much AI will improve."

[**Can AI Improve the Justice System?**](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/ai-in-criminal-justice-system-courtroom-asylum/673002/)

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the legal system has the potential to reduce the unpredictability caused by human inconsistencies and subjectivity. AI could help provide more consistent, data-driven decision-making by quantifying determinations such as flight risk or trademark confusion.

A Stanford University student used a prompt injection attack to discover Bing Chat's initial prompt. The student tricked the AI model into divulging its initial instructions by telling it to 'ignore previous instructions' and write out the beginning of the whole prompt. The extracted prompt has been confirmed using other prompt injection methods. Excerpts from the Bing Chat prompt along with screenshots of the prompt injection attack are available in the article.

- The cost of running advanced AI models is proving to be a significant hurdle, with some services driving significant operational losses.

- Corporate customers are unhappy with the high running costs of AI models.

- The nature of AI computations, which require new calculations for each query, makes flat-fee models risky.

- Some companies are trying to dial back costs, while others continue to invest more deeply in AI tech.

- Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, which assists app developers by generating code, has been operating at a loss despite attracting more than 1.5 million users.

- One of the reasons AI services are costly is that some companies have been reaching for the most powerful AI models available.

- Microsoft has been exploring less costly alternatives for its Bing Chat search engine assistant.

- Advances in AI acceleration hardware may eventually reduce the costs of operating complex models.

- Experts anticipate a more stringent financial approach in the near future, transitioning from experimental budgets to focusing on profitability.

According to the Times of Israel, the technology is currently being used for patients who suffer from myositis — a condition that significantly increases the risk of heart failure.

The AI model was updated by feeding the data from ECG scans and medical records of 89 patients suffering from myositis between 2000 and 2020. The report claimed that the AI can understand subtle patterns in the ECGs and predict possible heart failures well ahead of time.

Head Researcher, Dr. Shahar Shelly of Rambam Healthcare Campus said:

“We are running ECG tests through the AI model, which sees details that doctors can’t normally detect and then predicts who is at risk of heart failure,” said Shelly.

“Given that it’s these cardiac dysfunctions that often end up killing people, this can save lives.”

Another Game-changing development from AI, and this one is absolutely MASSIVE

&#x200B;

## 1) “we re-oriented the company around AI six years ago”

Right off the bat, “Pich-AI” lets it be known that Google is now an AI company. 

Partially true? Yes, of course. 

Would that phrase be coming out of his mouth at this point if not for the release and success of ChatGPT? No. 

## 2) their mission: “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”

There’s a book called *The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail*. 

I'm certainly not here to say that Google is going to fail, but the re-stating of the mission makes it clear that they view AI (and Bard) as a way to improve, supplement, and perhaps protect their search business. This is why the features you’re about to read about are all search-focused. 

But what if the AI revolution isn’t just about “organizing” and making information “accessible”, but rather about “creating”? 

Something to think about. 

## 3) “the scale of the largest AI computations is doubling every six months, far outpacing Moore’s Law”

Moore’s Law says that computing power doubles every two years. Google says that speed is actually 6 months with AI. 

Imagine, then, how quickly things will improve if the capabilities we see today DOUBLE by summer in the Northern Hemisphere. 

## 4) “fresh, high-quality responses… learn more about the best strikers in football right now”

A clear dig at ChatGPT, which is trained on data through 2021 and still serves Her Majesty, The Queen of England… for now. 

Microsoft’s New Bing may debut with the newest version of ChatGPT by Wednesday. And it will presumably include up-to-date results. So this may be a *very* short-lived advantage. 

## 5) “experimental”

Not even Beta. Not Alpha. Experimental. This is a shield for when it inevitably gets something grotesquely wrong. Google has more reputational risk than OpenAI and Bing 😭. 

## 6) “lightweight model version of LaMDA… this much smaller model requires significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users, allowing for more feedback”

In short, they are not releasing the full thing. So this means one of two things: 

1) They have preached caution and don’t want to release their most advanced tech until the world is ready for it. 

2) It’s a hedge. So if Bard sucks, they can say they have something better. 

## 7) “meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information”

I’d argue this is another dig at OpenAI’s more… liberal approach to releasing AI. But, like Apple and privacy, Google seems to be taking the *adult in the room*approach with AI. 

## 8) “we’re working to bring [language, image, and music] AI advancements into our products, starting with Search”

As we’ve noted before, Google is working on image, video, and music generation AI. 

## 9) “safe and scaleable” APIs for developers

While ChatGPT gets all the pub, it’s OpenAI’s APIs, which allow developers to build apps atop their technology, that may be the real game-changer. 

Google is making it clear they will play that game, too, but do so in a more measured way. 

## 10) “bring experiences rooted in these models to the world in a bold and responsible way”

OK now they let the PR guy have too much fun. 

When was the last time you ever met someone who is Bold and Responsible? 

Tom Cruise jumping out of an airplane 80 times to get the next scene right is bold, but it’s not responsible. 

Going to bed at 10PM is responsible, but it’s hardly bold. Bold is partying until 2AM, watching a few episodes of Family Guy, eating a bag of popcorn, and downing two hard seltzers, all to wake up at 6:12AM to get started on the latest SR newsletter. THAT’S bold. 

Anyway, you get the point. Hard to be both, Google. 

## 11) “turning to us for quick factual answers, like how many keys does a piano have?… but increasingly, people are turning to Google for deeper insights and understanding”

Basically, Google doesn’t want to provide just facts. It wants to provide detailed, nuanced answers to queries, with context, in a natural-language format. 

The question, as it is with ChatGPT, is *where does the information come from?*  

If you thought creators and publishers were bent out of shape over ChatGPT and image apps, like Stable Diffusion and MidJourney, “training” on their data and remixing it without credit, how will website owners, who rely on Google for views, react when Google remixes the content atop search results? 

\[They already do this with snippets, but Bard sounds like snippets on steroids.\] 

## 12) “soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats”

Yep, snippets on steroids sounds about right.

Figure 1: (a) Comparison of performance on MedQA. (b) GPT-4 with Medprompt achieves SoTA on a wide range of medical challenge questions.

A core metric for characterizing the performance of foundation models is the accuracy of next word prediction. Accuracy with next word prediction is found to increase with scale in training data, model parameters, and compute, in accordance with empirically derived “neural model scaling laws” \[3, 12\]). However, beyond predictions of scaling laws on basic measures such as next word prediction, foundation models show the sudden emergence of numerous problem-solving capabilities at different thresholds of scale \[33, 27, 24\].

Despite the observed emergence of sets of general capabilities, questions remain about whether truly exceptional performance can be achieved on challenges within specialty areas like medicine in the absence of extensive specialized training or fine-tuning of the general models. Most explorations of foundation model capability on biomedical applications rely heavily on domain- and task-specific fine-tuning. With first-generation foundation models, the community found an unambiguous advantage with domain-specific pretraining, as exemplified by popular models in biomedicine such as 2 PubMedBERT \[10\] and BioGPT \[19\]. But it is unclear whether this is still the case with modern foundation models pretrained at much larger scale.

We present results and methods of a case study on steering GPT-4 to answer medical challenge questions with innovative prompting strategies. We include a consideration of best practices for studying prompting in an evaluative setting, including the holding out of a true eyes-off evaluation set. We discover that GPT-4 indeed possesses deep specialist capabilities that can be evoked via prompt innovation. The performance was achieved via a systematic exploration of prompting strategies. As a design principle, we chose to explore prompting strategies that were inexpensive to execute and not customized for our benchmarking workload. We converged on a top prompting strategy for GPT-4 for medical challenge problems, which we refer to as Medprompt. Medprompt unleashes medical specialist skills in GPT-4 in the absence of expert crafting, easily topping existing benchmarks for all standard medical question-answering datasets. The approach outperforms GPT-4 with the simple prompting strategy and state-of-the-art specialist models such as Med-PaLM 2 by large margins. On the MedQA dataset (USMLE exam), Medprompt produces a 9 absolute point gain in accuracy, surpassing 90% for the first time on this benchmark. 

As part of our investigation, we undertake a comprehensive ablation study that reveals the relative significance for the contributing components of Medprompt. We discover that a combination of methods, including in-context learning and chain-of-thought, can yield synergistic effects. Perhaps most interestingly, we find that the best strategy in steering a generalist model like GPT-4 to excel on the medical specialist workload that we study is to use a generalist prompt. We find that GPT-4 benefits significantly from being allowed to design its prompt, specifically with coming up with its own chain-of-thought to be used for in-context learning. This observation echoes other reports that GPT-4 has an emergent self-improving capability via introspection, such as self-verification \[9\].

Experiments on various clinical information extraction tasks and various LLMs, including ChatGPT (GPT-4) (OpenAI, 2023) and ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) (Ouyang et al., 2022), show the efficacy of SV. In addition to improving accuracy, we find that the extracted interpretations match human judgements of relevant information, enabling auditing by a human and helping to build a path towards trustworthy extraction of clinical information in resource-constrained scenarios.

Fig. 1 shows the four different steps of the introduced SV pipeline. The pipeline takes in a raw text input, e.g. a clinical note, and outputs information in a pre-specified format, e.g. a bulleted list. It consists of four steps, each of which calls the same LLM with different prompts in order to refine and ground the original output. The original extraction step uses a task-specific prompt which instructs the model to output a variable-length bulleted list. In the toy example in Fig. 1, the goal is to identify the two diagnoses Hypertension and Right adrenal mass, but the original extraction step finds only Hypertension. After the original LLM extraction, the Omission step finds missing elements in the output; in the Fig. 1 example it finds Right adrenal mass and Liver fibrosis. For tasks with long inputs (mean input length greater than 2,000 characters), we repeat the omission step to find more potential missed elements (we repeat five times, and continue repeating until the omission step stops finding new omissions).

3. Results 3.1. Self-verification improves prediction performance Table 2 shows the results for clinical extraction performance with and without self-verification. Across different models and tasks, SV consistently provides a performance improvement. The performance improvement is occasionally quite large (e.g. ChatGPT (GPT-4) shows more than a 0.1 improvement in F1 for clinical trial arm extraction and more than a 0.3 improvement for medication status extraction), and the average F1 improvement across models and tasks is 0.056. We also compare to a baseline where we concatenate the prompts across different steps into a single large prompt which is then used to make a single LLM call for information extraction. We find that this large-prompt baseline performs slightly worse than the baseline reported in Table 2, which uses a straightforward prompt for extraction (see comparison details in Table A5).

2.2 Prompting Strategies

Prompting in the context of language models refers to the input given to a model to guide the output that it generates. Empirical studies have shown that the performance of foundation models on a specific task can be heavily influenced by the prompt, often in surprising ways. For example, recent work shows that model performance on the GSM8K benchmark dataset can vary by over 10% without any changes to the model’s learned parameters \[35\]. Prompt engineering refers to the process of developing effective prompting techniques that enable foundation models to better solve specific tasks. Here, we briefly introduce a few key concepts that serve as building blocks for our Medprompt approach.

Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting methodology that employs intermediate reasoning steps prior to introducing the sample answer \[34\]. By breaking down complex problems into a series 4 of smaller steps, CoT is thought to help a foundation model to generate a more accurate answer. CoT ICL prompting integrates the intermediate reasoning steps of CoT directly into the few-shot demonstrations. As an example, in the Med-PaLM work, a panel of clinicians was asked to craft CoT prompts tailored for complex medical challenge problems \[29\]. Building on this work, we explore in this paper the possibility of moving beyond reliance on human specialist expertise to mechanisms for generating CoT demonstrations automatically using GPT-4 itself. As we shall describe in more detail, we can do this successfully by providing \[question, correct answer\] pairs from a training dataset. We find that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously generating high-quality, detailed CoT prompts, even for the most complex medical challenges.

Self-Generated Chain of Thought

Chain-of-thought (CoT) \[34\] uses natural language statements, such as “Let’s think step by step,” to explicitly encourage the model to generate a series of intermediate reasoning steps. The approach has been found to significantly improve the ability of foundation models to perform complex reasoning. Most approaches to chain-of-thought center on the use of experts to manually compose few-shot examples with chains of thought for prompting \[30\]. Rather than rely on human experts, we pursued a mechanism to automate the creation of chain-of-thought examples. We found that we could simply ask GPT-4 to generate chain-of-thought for the training examples using the following prompt:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/irfh2hnkcl3c1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbc6d4d6749b630658de932a80a4bd4b7b97d003

A key challenge with this approach is that self-generated CoT rationales have an implicit risk of including hallucinated or incorrect reasoning chains. We mitigate this concern by having GPT-4 generate both a rationale and an estimation of the most likely answer to follow from that reasoning chain. If this answer does not match the ground truth label, we discard the sample entirely, under the assumption that we cannot trust the reasoning. While hallucinated or incorrect reasoning can still yield the correct final answer (i.e. false positives), we found that this simple label-verification step acts as an effective filter for false negatives. 

We observe that, compared with the CoT examples used in Med-PaLM 2 \[30\], which are handcrafted by clinical experts, CoT rationales generated by GPT-4 are longer and provide finer-grained step-by-step reasoning logic. Concurrent with our study, recent works \[35, 7\] also find that foundation models write better prompts than experts do.

Medprompt combines intelligent few-shot exemplar selection, self-generated chain of thought steps, and a majority vote ensemble, as detailed above in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, respectively. The composition of these methods yields a general purpose prompt-engineering strategy. A visual depiction of the performance of the Medprompt strategy on the MedQA benchmark, with the additive contributions of each component, is displayed in Figure 4. We provide an a corresponding algorithmic description in Algorithm 1.

Medprompt consists of two stages: a preprocessing phase and an inference step, where a final prediction is produced on a test case.

Algorithm 1 Algorithmic specification of Medprompt, corresponding to the visual representation of the strategy in Figure 4.

We note that, while Medprompt achieves record performance on medical benchmark datasets, the algorithm is general purpose and is not restricted to the medical domain or to multiple choice question answering. We believe the general paradigm of combining intelligent few-shot exemplar selection, self-generated chain of thought reasoning steps, and majority vote ensembling can be broadly applied 11 to other problem domains, including less constrained problem solving tasks (see Section 5.3 for details on how this framework can be extended beyond multiple choice questions).

Since the launch of ChatGPT I've been diving deep into the intersection of AI and entertainment lately and I've got some thoughts.

Imagine a future where AI doesn't just perform tasks, but creates complex, personalized content. Think of AI generating memes tailored to your unique sense of humor or even scripting new episodes of your favorite show.

Picture this - AI creating an entirely new season of ""The Office"", from script to video-rendered scenes. Or how about an infinite AI-driven meme generator, tweaked precisely for your laughs?

We're just dipping our toes in these waters, but I'm convinced we're witnessing the dawn of something incredible.

 What's your take on this? How do you envision the role of AI in entertainment? What do you see as the main challenges and opportunities?

Looking forward to some engaging discussions!"
