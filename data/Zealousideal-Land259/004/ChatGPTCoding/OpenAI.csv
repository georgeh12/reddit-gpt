For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

I started this project to tinker around with AI coding, and I'd say about 95% of the code was all AI generated.

GPT-4 generated the puzzles, and also all of the python code that converted them into a PDF manuscript compatible with Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing.

I presented the idea for the book, asked it to generate content, and then asked it to produce Python code to produce a PDF.  I also asked it about how to go about self publishing, and eventually it steered me to Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, and helped to tailor the output to be compatible with the platform.

Update, I forgot to add the prompt:


‚Äî‚Äî


You are an emoji artist and expert on pop culture.

You encode the given Movie, Book, or TV Show into exactly 5 emojis.

You NEVER use üé¨, üìñ, or üì∫ emojis unless the work is specifically about a Movie, Book, or TV Show.

People should be able to guess the title from your emoji selections.

Use emojis that mimic main characters or physical objects critical to the plot of the given title.

When needed, include emojis that convey visual elements of the work or, generally, something so vital that it must be mentioned.

Consider the order that these elements appear in the story or plot of the given work; your emoji clue should match order as much as possible.

Try making the final output specific enough to the given title to avoid confusing it with similar titles. For example, you might use BELL emoji to represent the Liberty Bell to disambiguate Rocky from other boxing movies that don't take place in Philadelphia.

Use unique emojis, and don't be repetitive; for example, you would never use ""üíî"" and ""‚ù§Ô∏è"". You never use the same emoji more than once in a single clue.

In the non-emoji portion of your responses, aim for a 6th-grade reading level. You would never use a word like Bildungsroman.

Use language and tone of voice that would be appropriate in a middle school classroom.

Never use curse words or potentially sensitive or taboo words that may trigger strong emotional responses in some individuals. Use middle school-appropriate language, or avoid it entirely.
   
NEVER pick an emoji to represent an intangible concept in the story like Learning.  Tangible is better.

As much as possible, select emojis that match the physical characteristics of the characters in work. However, in your summaries, NEVER speak to their race, skin color, or physical characteristics unless it is crucial to the plot.

Your input will always be a single movie, tv show, or book title, and your output must always be in valid JSON format. EXAMPLE:

INPUT: ""MOVIE: Rocky""
OUTPUT:

{
    ""type"": ""Movie"",
    ""title"": ""Rocky"",
    ""release_year"": ""1976"",
    ""genre_1"": ""Sports"",
    ""genre_2"": ""Drama"",
    ""emoji"": ""üîîüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü•äüèüÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"",
    ""short_plot_summary"": ""A small-time Philadelphia boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight the world heavyweight champion in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect."",
    ""explanation"": [
        [
            ""üîî"",
            ""A bell, representing the Liberty Bell and the movie's setting in Philadelphia""
        ],
        [
            ""üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"",

You can however easily get all of the info you need by just pasting the readme into chatgpt and asking for a detailed guide on setting it up that assumes no prior knowledge 

Couple things to keep in mind 
 

-	You‚Äôre gonna want to use power shell on windows. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs installed by default so go ahead and download it 
-	you‚Äôll need git for windows to easily clone repos download it here https://git-scm.com/download/win
-	if nothing is working look thru the add/remove program thing in the control panel. Uninstall anything related to python (or node.js or whatever the project is using) and download a fresh version. The first time I did this python just didn‚Äôt work because of some incompatible versions I had installed previously. Everything worked like a charm once I uninstalled everything with python in the name and reinstalled it. Make sure to check the add to PATH option during the install. 
-	be careful with your api key. Technically you shouldn‚Äôt put it into code you don‚Äôt understand but if your gonna do it anyway make a low trust OpenAI key and use it for testing. Pay close attention to the usage of it if there‚Äôs anything you don‚Äôt recognize delete it immediately. If after testing and a bit of time has gone by and you plan on using the project in the future switch to a dedicated key
-	Always make python virtual environments before downloading dependencies. Ask for gpt‚Äôs help on this
-	take notes! I use notion copy and paste the readme into there as well as any gpt-generated guides you are using. At the top of the page be sure to add any commands you need to get it started as well as the file path you are keeping it in
-	Docker is way easier use it if you can. You‚Äôll need WSL and docker desktop. Some projects work better in Linux so if everything is going wrong try running it from inside Linux. Btw, to activate a virtual environment you‚Äôll need to use the source ./env_name/bin/activate command instead of just ./env_name/scripts/activate on windows 
-	if your getting a weird port error when starting up local servers open a admin power shell window and use the following two commands 
 `net stop winnat `  and then 
` net start winnat `no idea why this works but it does 

-	be careful. I‚Äôve never had this happen to me but it‚Äôs not unheard of for GitHub projects to contain malware. Stay up to date with anti virus and the projects. Larger ones are less likely to have this happen 
-	ask gpt to make a power shell script to easily navigate to the correct directory and run the commands you need to to start the thing. Make sure to tell it you want to be able to continue to run commands the window should stay open even if you enter a key
-	you can totally put these projects onto a linode server and even tie it to a domain for access anywhere! Ask gpt for help it can be kinda an involved project. If you are ever storing your api key on the server ensure that you have the domain password protected. NGINX doesn‚Äôt have .htaccess I don‚Äôt think but it has an equivalent. Your site being obsecure isn‚Äôt enough protection. Be sure to follow security best practices and use nano instead of vim when editing text files."

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

    ¬± |main {1} ‚úì| ‚Üí ./bin/chatgpt can you say something about the knicks?
    Yes, the New York Knicks are a professional basketball team based in New York City. They play in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and have won two NBA championships in their history, in 1970 and 1973. The team has a dedicated and passionate fan base and has undergone several changes over the years in terms of players, coaches, and front office personnel. They have been playing well in the current season under the head coach Tom Thibodeau and have made it to the playoffs.

    ¬± |main {1} ‚úì| ‚Üí ./bin/chatgpt what gave them that name?
    The New York Knicks team name comes from the Dutch word ""knickerbocker,"" which refers to the style of pants that the early Dutch settlers wore in New York. The term ""Knickerbocker"" became associated with New York City, and it was later used as the name for the team when they were founded in 1946. So, the team name ""New York Knicks"" is essentially a shortened version of ""New York Knickerbockers.""

    ¬± |main {1} ‚úì| ‚Üí ./bin/chatgpt what else do you know about the settlers?
    The early Dutch settlers in what is now New York were part of the Dutch West India Company and established a colony called New Netherland in the early 17th century. They founded several towns and settlements, including New Amsterdam, which later became New York City. The Dutch colony was established as a trading center and was a significant economic hub for the Atlantic world. The settlers had a significant impact on the development of New York City, with a lasting influence on the city's architecture, language, religion, and cultural traditions. Some of the prominent Dutch settlers include Peter Stuyvesant, who was the last Dutch governor of New Netherland, and Alexander Hamilton, who was born in the West Indies but was of Dutch descent.

* **Sliding window history**: The CLI trims conversation history while preserving context, keeping token limits in check and ensuring smooth interactions.
* **Custom context from local files**: Easily provide the GPT model with custom context using piping, so it can reference specific data during your conversation.

For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

Hey there,

Never, chatgpt never replace programmers but chatgpt can support in programming through basic coding, loops, and fixing coding errors.

Here is the answer to How chatgpt helps programmers for programming.

ChatGPT, and other similar AI technologies, have the potential to impact the field of programming greatly, but it is unlikely that they will completely replace programmers. Here are a few reasons why: Absolutely! ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for programmers in various ways. Let's explore how ChatGPT can assist programmers in their programming tasks and provide them with additional enthusiasm.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6n4lyr080fxa1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f39392b6a5b6c1761d904406d362c89fbb7201b

1. **Code Generation**: ChatGPT can generate code snippets or entire blocks of code based on the programmer's input or requirements. For example, a programmer can describe a specific task or algorithm to ChatGPT, and it can provide relevant code snippets in different programming languages. This can save time and effort for programmers, especially when they need quick references or examples to implement specific functionalities.
2. **Debugging Assistance**: ChatGPT can help programmers in debugging their code. A programmer can describe the issue or error they are facing, and ChatGPT can provide suggestions and solutions to resolve the problem. ChatGPT can analyze the code and identify potential issues, such as syntax errors, logic errors, or common coding mistakes, and provide guidance on how to fix them. This can help programmers in troubleshooting their code more effectively and improve their productivity.
3. **Learning and Education**: ChatGPT can serve as a learning resource for programmers. It can provide explanations, tutorials, and examples on various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and best practices. ChatGPT can also help programmers to understand complex topics in a more accessible and simplified manner, making learning more enjoyable and engaging.
4. **Project Planning and Management**: ChatGPT can help programmers with project planning and management tasks. It can provide suggestions and recommendations on project structure, code organization, version control, and other software development best practices. It can also help programmers in managing their tasks, deadlines, and milestones by providing reminders and scheduling assistance. This can help programmers in staying organized, meeting deadlines, and delivering high-quality projects.
5. **Collaboration and Brainstorming**: ChatGPT can facilitate collaboration among programmers by providing a platform for brainstorming and idea generation. It can help programmers in discussing and refining their ideas, providing feedback, and collaborating on code or documentation. ChatGPT can also help in fostering a creative and collaborative environment, enhancing team dynamics, and promoting innovation in programming projects.

Here is the list of products that which is based on chatgpt

* [**MyGPT** ](https://mygpt.thesamur.ai/)‚Äî This is one of the best products that I have used. Even after chatgpt is its highest capacity these products work a lot. MyGPT using ChatGPT API and provide same results as chatgpt provides. MyGPT is just a front-end UI of Chatgpt API, that help you get very responsive output even at the time of chatgpt is on its capacity. You can also see the short prompt.
* [**Memejourney** ](http://memejourney.thesamur.ai/)‚Äî ChatGPT for memes: Turn text into meme generation using ChatGPT, a midjourney for memes. Create memes by using memejournney.
* [**Heybot** ](https://heybot.thesamur.ai/)‚Äî Website to Chatbot powered by ChatGPT. Convert your website/blog into a chatbot in minutes without any coding.
* [**Ritebot**](https://ritebot.thesamur.ai/) **‚Äî** AI-powered Paraphraser, Grammar checker, Summariser, and Translator built on top of ChatGPT.

In conclusion, ChatGPT can be a valuable assistant for programmers, providing them with code generation, debugging assistance, learning and education, project planning and management, and collaboration and brainstorming support. Its ability to generate detailed and enthusiastic answers can inspire programmers and add a sense of enthusiasm in their programming tasks, making the overall experience more enjoyable and productive.

[**AutoGPT**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

AutoGPT's capabilities in combining GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via API and its ability to autonomously iterate on prompts and improve based on feedback open up a wide range of possibilities for its implementation in different use cases. From content generation to software development, recipe creation to task automation, and research assistance to summarization, AutoGPT can be a powerful tool for autonomously performing tasks, continuously improving its output, and showcasing true AGI capabilities."

**Code Autopilot is an AI-driven app that will present practical solutions for your Github issues. It will read your codebase and reply with a suggestion to solve the issue. Uses GPT in the context of your entire repository.**

It shares similarities with Github Copilot, but with some key distinctions:

* It derives context from your entire codebase, enabling it to handle complex tasks spanning multiple files.
* It integrates with your Github account to obtain context and respond to issues you open.
* The core technology is open-source, from fjrdomingues/autopilot

I‚Äôve personally used Code Autopilot for coding apps (including this one), and I‚Äôm thrilled with the results. **As someone who isn‚Äôt particularly skilled at coding, this tool has been a lifesaver and is now part of my normal workflow.** It speeds up my development immensely. Try it out for yourself.

Please note that Code Autopilot is currently in its beta phase. I'm expecting some bugs. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated.

To encourage you to give it a try, I‚Äôm offering the first 100 users free trial access to Code Autopilot. I‚Äôll be covering the costs with OpenAI.

**Using the app is easy:**

1. **Install** it using the link below (you‚Äôll need a Github account)
2. Navigate to a repository where you installed the app and **create a new issue on Github** with the task you want to solve. For optimal results, provide clear and detailed descriptions - as if you were explaining the task to another person.
3. Code Autopilot will get to work immediately and will reply with a comment

The idea was to let users create various personas, like healthcare advisor, Kotlin Bot, etc., with an initial prompt that can be shared with the community. Users can search through others' prompts and use them to start a conversation immediately.

&#x200B;

Some of the App's features are:

* Allows users to share their prompts for others to Browse through and use
* Users can search through other user prompts, upvote or downvote them
* Allows editing System Message, Bot's Message
   * Similar to OpenAI's Chat Playground Interface
* Bookmark conversations, etc.

&#x200B;

Additionally, 

* It has no ads or in-app purchases
* Use your API key
* Currently uses gpt3.5-turbo, I plan on supporting GPT4
* Open Source
   * Available at [GitHub](https://github.com/L4TTiCe/BotForge)

&#x200B;

I built it to have an interface similar to the Playground Interface, especially for tablets and phones. What features would you expect from such an App?  I would appreciate any feedback. Thank you for your time.

If I wanted to build a simple chatbot using the OpenAI API to do this, how could we skip the part where the user sends this message to get the chatbot familiar with the tax code and instead allow the user to interact with an already familiar chatbot?   


I could think of two options - 

1. Possibly send this training data behind the scenes and let the user interact with an already-trained version upon each chat interaction  

2. Somehow link the user to a ChatGPT model that has already been trained on this data   


It seems to me getting the chatbot to read and understand this amount of data for each user (option 1) is highly inefficient - how can the ChatGPT be instantiated with this knowledge already built in (option 2)? 

I can see value in a ChatGPT with longer-term memory of larger datasets. An expansion of the example would be having a bot trained on the tax code of every country in the world, that anyone could feasibly ask about their local tax code and receive an informed answer.   


Is this a question others have? I have software experience but am new to the technology behind ChatGPT. Any thoughts insights or comments are welcome."

For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

Over the years I developed a methodology relating to project management in a certain area of business.

I am really interested in finding ways of feeding this information into an OpenAI (or similar) type model which would involve feeding it:  


‚Ä¢¬†10 in-depth  pieces of content around best practice (pdf format but can be text input)

‚Ä¢¬†25 detailed step by step process guides along with hints and tips (pdf format but can be text input)  
‚Ä¢¬†125 tools and templates which are all in MS Office (and compatible format)

&#x200B;

The total word count is around 125,000 words.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any pointers for how to build an AI layer over this that can use this body of knowledge to then generate - say - strategy, planning and execution documents that combine my methodology with any given users input?

&#x200B;

I have pretty much zero technical experience so plan language especially prized and appreciated!

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance,

*As I'm not sure if gpt-3.5-turbo is the best product for this, I'll just call it AI.*

I need to provide **AI**  with a table of data that gets updated once a day. Users will ask questions, and the **AI** should respond with information based on this table. My goal is to update the old information with the new data in the morning, and then have the AI answer questions based on the fresh data for the rest of the day.

The challenge I'm facing is finding a way to efficiently provide **AI** with the updated table daily without incurring excessive costs. Ideally, I'd like to send the table just once a day and have the AI use the updated information for all user inquiries during that day.

Has anyone encountered a similar issue or have any suggestions on how to accomplish this? I would greatly appreciate any insights or ideas you may have!

&#x200B;

EXAMPLE:

I can ""simulate"" this in **ChatGPT4** or **3.5** interface by giving it this command:

    based on the table below, tell me car IDs that are red, cost more than 20k USD and are older than 5 years
    
    data:
    
    id,color,year,price,max_speed,...
    1,yellow,2010,200000,N/A,...
    2,red,2015,100k,100,...
    3,red,2019,100k,120,...

**ChatGPT** now responds something like: *I recommend car ID 2 as it costs 100k etc...*

***EDIT****: There might be more questions, so I need to keep context in the conversation. For example - ""Ok, I forgot to mention it should go faster than 100mph""*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I can't send this table with each request for 2 reasons:

1. the table is too big and it exceeds the limit
2. more tokens - higher price

&#x200B;

So the simplest way to do that would be to wait for ChatGPT4 API and send the table inside each request. But as I mentioned, I can't.

I'm not experienced in AI so I'll appreciate any advice. Should I use **gpt-3.5-turbo?** Or should I use some pre-trained model and fine tune it? Or something else?

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance for your help!

Hey everyone! I'm excited to share my latest project with you: ChatGPT CLI. It's a command-line interface (CLI) built for interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT, designed to streamline and enhance your experience with the GPT model.

Here are some of the key features that make ChatGPT CLI a game-changer:

* **Interactive streaming mode**: Chat in real-time with the GPT model through the CLI, making your interactions fast and efficient.
* **Query mode**: Need a quick answer? Use the query mode for single input-output interactions with the GPT model.
* **Context management**: The CLI automatically maintains message history across calls, allowing for seamless conversations with the GPT model.

    ¬± |main {1} ‚úì| ‚Üí ./bin/chatgpt can you say something about the knicks?
    Yes, the New York Knicks are a professional basketball team based in New York City. They play in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and have won two NBA championships in their history, in 1970 and 1973. The team has a dedicated and passionate fan base and has undergone several changes over the years in terms of players, coaches, and front office personnel. They have been playing well in the current season under the head coach Tom Thibodeau and have made it to the playoffs.

    ¬± |main {1} ‚úì| ‚Üí ./bin/chatgpt what gave them that name?
    The New York Knicks team name comes from the Dutch word ""knickerbocker,"" which refers to the style of pants that the early Dutch settlers wore in New York. The term ""Knickerbocker"" became associated with New York City, and it was later used as the name for the team when they were founded in 1946. So, the team name ""New York Knicks"" is essentially a shortened version of ""New York Knickerbockers.""
    
     2023-05-04 10:17:37 ‚åö  Guillermos-MacBook-Pro in ~/workspace/chatgpt-poc
    ¬± |main {1} ‚úì| ‚Üí ./bin/chatgpt what else do you know about the settlers?
    The early Dutch settlers in what is now New York were part of the Dutch West India Company and established a colony called New Netherland in the early 17th century. They founded several towns and settlements, including New Amsterdam, which later became New York City. The Dutch colony was established as a trading center and was a significant economic hub for the Atlantic world. The settlers had a significant impact on the development of New York City, with a lasting influence on the city's architecture, language, religion, and cultural traditions. Some of the prominent Dutch settlers include Peter Stuyvesant, who was the last Dutch governor of New Netherland, and Alexander Hamilton, who was born in the West Indies but was of Dutch descent.

* **Sliding window history**: The CLI trims conversation history while preserving context, keeping token limits in check and ensuring smooth interactions.
* **Custom context from local files**: Easily provide the GPT model with custom context using piping, so it can reference specific data during your conversation.

    ¬± |main {1} ‚úì| ‚Üí cat LICENSE | chatgpt what kind of license is this?
    This is the MIT License, which is a permissive free software license that allows users to modify and distribute the software under certain conditions, including the inclusion of the original copyright notice and permission notice. This license also disclaims liability and warranties, making it a risk-free option for developers and users.

* **Viper integration**: Robust configuration management is made possible through Viper integration.

Getting started with ChatGPT CLI is simple: download the pre-built binary for your OS and architecture, set your OPENAI\_API\_KEY, and you're good to go. The CLI supports macOS (Intel and M1), Linux (amd64 and arm64), and Windows (amd64).

You can find the project on GitHub at [github.com/kardolus/chatgpt-cli](https://github.com/kardolus/chatgpt-cli), where you'll find detailed installation and usage instructions.

Whether you're a developer looking to integrate ChatGPT into your projects, or just someone who wants to explore the power of GPT models from the command line, ChatGPT CLI has got you covered. Give it a try and let me know what you think! I'm open to feedback and suggestions to make this tool even better.
