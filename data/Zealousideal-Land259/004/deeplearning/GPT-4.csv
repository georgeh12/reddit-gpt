[Sam Altman Might Have Just Pulled Off The Coup Of The Decade](https://preview.redd.it/sg24cw3zekea1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eeae99b5e025a74a6cbe3aac7a842d2fff989a1)

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

First of all, tldr at bottom, typed more than expected here.  

Please excuse the rather naive perspective I have here.  I've followed along with great interest, but this is not my industry.

Regardless, I have spent the past 3-4 days falling down a brutally obsessive rabbit hole, and I cannot seem to find this information.  I'm assuming it's just that I am missing context of course, and regardless of whether there is a clear answer, I'm trying to get a better understanding of this topic so that I could better appraise the situation myself.

Really I suppose I have two questions.  **The first** is regarding model parallelization.

I'm assuming this is not generic whatsoever.  What is the typical process engineers go about for designing such a pipeline?  Specifically in regards to these new LLaMA models, is something like ALPA relevant?  Deepspeed?

More importantly, what information should I be seeking to determine this myself?

This roughly segues to my **second inquiry**.

The reason I'm curious about splitting the model pipeline etc., is that I am potentially in interested in standing a server up for this.  Although I don't have much of a budget for this build (\~$30-40K is the rough top-end, but I'd be a lot happier around $20-25K), the money is there if I can genuinely satisfy my use-case.

I work at a small, but borderline manic startup working on enterprise software; 90% of the work we're doing based in the react/node ecosystem, some low-level work for backend services, and some very interesting database work that I have very little to do with.  I am a fullstack engineer that grew up playing with C++ => C#, and somehow ended up spending all of my time r/w'ing javascript.  Lol.  Anyways.

Part of our roadmap since GPT-3 and the playground were made publicly accessible, involves usage of these transformer models, and their ability to interpret natural language inputs, whether from user inputs, or scraped input values generated somewhere in a chain of requests / operations.

Seeing GPT-3 in action made me specifically realize that my estimations on this technology had been wildly off.  Seeing ChatGPT in action and uptick, the API's becoming available, has me further panicked.

Running our inference through their API has never really been an option for us.  I haven't even really looked that far into it, but bottom line the data running through our platform is all back-office, highly sensitive business information, and many have agreements explicitly restricting the movement of data to or from any cloud services, with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google all specifically mentioned.

Regardless of the reasoning for these contracts, the LLaMA release has had me obsessed over this topic in more detail than before, and whether or not I would be able to get this setup privately, for our use-case.

**To get to the actual second inquiry**:

Say I want to throw a budget rig together for this in a server cabinet.  Am I able to effectively parallelize the LLaMA model, well enough to justify going with 24GB VRAM 4090's in the rig?  Say I do so with DeepSpeed, or some of the standard model parallelization libraries.

Is the performance cost low enough to justify taking the extra compute here over 1/3 - 1/2 as many RTX6000 ADA's?

Or should I be grabbing the 48GB ADA's?

Like I said, I apologize for the naivety, I'm really looking for more information so that I can start to put this picture together better on my own.  It really isn't the easiest topic to research with how quickly things seem to move, and the giant gap between conversation depths (gamer || phd in a lot of the most interesting or niche discussions, little between).

Thank you very much for your time.

TL;DR - Any information on LLaMA model parallelization at the moment?  Will it be compatible with things like zero or alpa?  How about for throwing a rig together right now for fine-tuning and then running inference on the LLaMA models?  48GB 6000 ADA's, or 24GB 4090's?

Planning on putting it in a mostly empty 42U cabinet that also houses our primary web server and networking hardware, so if there is a sales pitch for 4090's across multiple nodes here, I do have a massive bias as the kind of nerd that finds that kind of hardware borderline erotic.

Hydro and cooling are not an issue, just usage of the budget and understanding the requirements / approach given memory limitations, and how to avoid communication bottlenecks or even balance them against raw compute.

Thanks again everyone!"

Based on that, we present a review of state-of-the-art methods on text-conditioned image synthesis, i.e., text-to-image. We further summarize applications beyond text-to-image generation: text-guided creative generation and text-guided image editing. Beyond the progress made so far, we discuss existing challenges and promising future directions.

I'd like my next job to be a NLP engineer. How should I prepare myself for it?

Here's some of the items I'm thinking

&#x200B;

1. More hands on projects I can put on resume, including integration with cloud services. Any recommendations on what kinds of projects I should pick?  
 
2. Tryout techniques of speeding up models like distilled model, dynamic shape, quantization. Anything else that would be helpful?  
 
3. Understand lower level of GPU programming knowledges. Not sure if this is helpful for me finding a NLP job. If so, what kind of things I can do to go deeper on this subject. I'm currently taking [Intro to Parallel Programming](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs344) CS344 course on Udemy (highly recommend btw).  
 
4. Grind leetcode :/

**ChatGPT goes viral.** Launched by OpenAI on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT has attracted unprecedented attention due to its powerful abilities all over the world.  It took only 5 days \[1\] and 2 months \[2\] for ChatGPT to have 1 million users and 100 million monthly users after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history. ChatGPT can be seen as the milestone for the GPT family to go viral. In academia, ChatGPT has also inspired a large number of works discussing its applications in multiple fields, with **more than 500 papers within four months** after release and **the number is still increasing rapidly.**  This brings a huge challenge for a researcher who hopes to have an overview of ChatGPT applications or hopes to start his or her journey with ChatGPT in their own field.  **To help more people keep up with the latest progress of the GPT family,** we’re glad to share a self-contained survey that not only summarizes **the recent applications** of ChatGPT and other GPT variants like GPT-4, but also introduces the **underlying techniques** and **challenges.** Please refer to the following link for the paper: [One Small Step for Generative AI, One Giant Leap for AGI: A Complete Survey on ChatGPT in AIGC Era](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369618942_One_Small_Step_for_Generative_AI_One_Giant_Leap_for_AGI_A_Complete_Survey_on_ChatGPT_in_AIGC_Era).

&#x200B;

**From ChatGPT to Generative AI.**  One highlighting ability of the GPT family is that it can generate natural languages, which falls into the area of Generative AI. Apart from text, Generative AI can also generate content in other modalities, such as image, audio, and graph. More excitingly, Generative AI is able to convert data from one modality to another one, such as the text-to-image task (generating images from text). **To help readers have a better overview of Generative AI,** we provide a complete survey on underlying **techniques,** summary and development of **typical tasks in academia**, and also **industrial applications.** Please refer to the following link for the paper.  [A Complete Survey on Generative AI (AIGC): Is ChatGPT from GPT-4 to GPT-5 All You Need?](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369385153_A_Complete_Survey_on_Generative_AI_AIGC_Is_ChatGPT_from_GPT-4_to_GPT-5_All_You_Need)

&#x200B;

**From Generative AI to Diffusion Models.** The prosperity of a field is always driven by the development of technology, and so is Generative AI.  Different from ChatGPT which generates text based on the transformer, **diffuson models** have greatly accelerated the development of other fields in Generative AI, such as image synthesis.  Although we provide a summary of diffusion models and typical tasks in the Generative AI survey, we cannot include detailed discussions due to paper length limitations. **For those who are interested in the technical details of diffusion models and the recent progress of their applications in Generative AI,** we provide three self-contained surveys on **how diffusion models are applied in three typical areas: Text-to-image diffusion models** (also includes related tasks such as image editing)**, Audio diffusion models** (including text to speech synthesis and enhancement), and **Graph diffusion models** (including molecule, protein and material areas). Please refer to the following links for the paper.

It's far from perfect, but I now added ChatGPT and it is surprisingly good at inferring what the project is about. It often generates interesting usage examples and explains the available command line options.

&#x200B;

You probably won't yet use this for larger projects, but I think this can make sense for small projects or single scripts. Many small scripts are very useful but might never be published because of the work that is required to document and explain it. Using this AI might assist you with that.

&#x200B;

Reportedly GPT-4 is coming out next week, which probably would make it even better.

I have an idea of a *sketch to design* program with deep learning and computer vision. I saw the very same concept before and I believe GPT-4 is capable of doing something similar. First, I have to say that I am familiar with the computer vision procedure. I did it [before](https://haghiri75.com/en/analyzing-components-of-an-electric-circuit-with-yolov5/) and I know using YOLO algorithms might be a good idea.

Also, I have no problems developing a ""Sketch to code"" program since I can pipe my results to another AI or code generator. But I also found [Uizard](http://uizard.io) which can turn your hand-drawn sketches into ""Design"".

It made some questions in my mind which are the following:

1. Is there any language for design? Or it's just XML, HTML or SVG coded file?
2. Is there any code/design generator which is capable of turning a simple design document (like *a page with a navbar*) to HTML or SVG? and **open source** of course!

The following is the **abstract** of the **survey on generative AI** with a summary **figure**.

As ChatGPT goes viral, generative AI (AIGC, a.k.a AI-generated content) has made headlines everywhere because of its ability to analyze and create text, images, and beyond. With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost impossible to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle.  In the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth noting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool out of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many people are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants) help ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? To answer this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is needed. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first look at AIGC, ranging from its **techniques** to **applications**. Modern generative AI relies on various technical foundations, ranging from **model architecture** and **self-supervised pretraining** to **generative modeling** methods (like GAN and diffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work focuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their output type, including **text**, **images**, **videos**, **3D content**, **etc**., which depicts the full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their significant applications in some mainstream **industries**, such as **education** and **creativity** content. Finally, we discuss the **challenges** currently faced and present an **outlook** on how generative AI might evolve in the near future.

It amazes me how much progress we've made in these fields, and the potential applications for them are seemingly endless. Although I love exploring the different areas where machine learning can have an impact, I also have some questions and would appreciate anyone's insights.

Conversely, a thought has crossed my mind regarding how these cutting-edge tools can also be used for disinformation or other negative purposes. It seems imperative that we, as a tech-savvy community, work together to ensure these tools remain positively focused and prevent them from being used to spread misinformation or other nefarious goals.

One particular area that has caught my eye is the powerful pipeline for background removal mentioned in a recent article. It utilizes the CUDA-accelerated MOG2 background segmentation algorithm and the Savant Video Analytics Framework, resulting in impressive processing speeds. I wonder, though, about the potential applications for this technology, both positive and negative.

Additionally, I came across an interesting topic on using machine learning to predict human preferences in assembly tasks. If we can successfully train robots to assist us, the implications for manufacturing, construction, and even everyday tasks could be significant. However, it begs the question of how much we should allow AI and robots to control our lives and the measures that need to be in place to ensure they remain our helpful assistants rather than our overlords.

In my quest to learn more, I stumbled upon a free deep learning course and was wondering if there are any other resources I could check out to expand my knowledge? It's crucial to comprehend the intricacies of these powerful tools to make informed decisions as a society regarding their applications and potential consequences.

I would love to hear your thoughts on the subjects and any recommendations for resources that will aid in deep learning and machine learning education. Let's work together to harness the potential of these technologies while maintaining a vigilant watch for the negative aspects that may arise.

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

29,11ium8l,deeplearning,GPT-4,comments,2023-03-05 11:10:56,LLaMA model parallelization and server configuration,ChristmasInOct,False,1.0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/11ium8l/llama_model_parallelization_and_server/,8,1678014656.0,"Hey everyone,

First of all, tldr at bottom, typed more than expected here.  

Please excuse the rather naive perspective I have here.  I've followed along with great interest, but this is not my industry.

Regardless, I have spent the past 3-4 days falling down a brutally obsessive rabbit hole, and I cannot seem to find this information.  I'm assuming it's just that I am missing context of course, and regardless of whether there is a clear answer, I'm trying to get a better understanding of this topic so that I could better appraise the situation myself.

Really I suppose I have two questions.  **The first** is regarding model parallelization.

I'm assuming this is not generic whatsoever.  What is the typical process engineers go about for designing such a pipeline?  Specifically in regards to these new LLaMA models, is something like ALPA relevant?  Deepspeed?

More importantly, what information should I be seeking to determine this myself?

This roughly segues to my **second inquiry**.

The reason I'm curious about splitting the model pipeline etc., is that I am potentially in interested in standing a server up for this.  Although I don't have much of a budget for this build (\~$30-40K is the rough top-end, but I'd be a lot happier around $20-25K), the money is there if I can genuinely satisfy my use-case.

I work at a small, but borderline manic startup working on enterprise software; 90% of the work we're doing based in the react/node ecosystem, some low-level work for backend services, and some very interesting database work that I have very little to do with.  I am a fullstack engineer that grew up playing with C++ => C#, and somehow ended up spending all of my time r/w'ing javascript.  Lol.  Anyways.

Part of our roadmap since GPT-3 and the playground were made publicly accessible, involves usage of these transformer models, and their ability to interpret natural language inputs, whether from user inputs, or scraped input values generated somewhere in a chain of requests / operations.

Seeing GPT-3 in action made me specifically realize that my estimations on this technology had been wildly off.  Seeing ChatGPT in action and uptick, the API's becoming available, has me further panicked.

Running our inference through their API has never really been an option for us.  I haven't even really looked that far into it, but bottom line the data running through our platform is all back-office, highly sensitive business information, and many have agreements explicitly restricting the movement of data to or from any cloud services, with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google all specifically mentioned.

Regardless of the reasoning for these contracts, the LLaMA release has had me obsessed over this topic in more detail than before, and whether or not I would be able to get this setup privately, for our use-case.

**To get to the actual second inquiry**:

Say I want to throw a budget rig together for this in a server cabinet.  Am I able to effectively parallelize the LLaMA model, well enough to justify going with 24GB VRAM 4090's in the rig?  Say I do so with DeepSpeed, or some of the standard model parallelization libraries.

Is the performance cost low enough to justify taking the extra compute here over 1/3 - 1/2 as many RTX6000 ADA's?

Or should I be grabbing the 48GB ADA's?

Like I said, I apologize for the naivety, I'm really looking for more information so that I can start to put this picture together better on my own.  It really isn't the easiest topic to research with how quickly things seem to move, and the giant gap between conversation depths (gamer || phd in a lot of the most interesting or niche discussions, little between).

Thank you very much for your time.

TL;DR - Any information on LLaMA model parallelization at the moment?  Will it be compatible with things like zero or alpa?  How about for throwing a rig together right now for fine-tuning and then running inference on the LLaMA models?  48GB 6000 ADA's, or 24GB 4090's?

Planning on putting it in a mostly empty 42U cabinet that also houses our primary web server and networking hardware, so if there is a sales pitch for 4090's across multiple nodes here, I do have a massive bias as the kind of nerd that finds that kind of hardware borderline erotic.

Hydro and cooling are not an issue, just usage of the budget and understanding the requirements / approach given memory limitations, and how to avoid communication bottlenecks or even balance them against raw compute.

Thanks again everyone!"

The amount of information and the undeniable impact of social media on our lives can be both enlightening and suffocating. It has become more important than ever for us to take care of our well-being and find a balance between consuming content and living in the present moment.

Another area that has drawn my curiosity is the growing discussions on sustainable living and eco-friendliness. It's inspiring how we are collectively working to create a better world for future generations. Whether it's through reducing waste, discovering alternative energy sources, or just being more aware of our surroundings, every action makes a difference.

Lastly, I've noticed an increase in discussions surrounding personal finance and investment. We are living in unprecedented times, and it's fascinating to see how the financial landscape has transformed.

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

I did it [before](https://haghiri75.com/en/analyzing-components-of-an-electric-circuit-with-yolov5/) and I know using YOLO algorithms might be a good idea.

Also, I have no problems developing a ""Sketch to code"" program since I can pipe my results to another AI or code generator. But I also found [Uizard](http://uizard.io) which can turn your hand-drawn sketches into ""Design"".

It made some questions in my mind which are the following:

1. Is there any language for design? Or it's just XML, HTML or SVG coded file?
2. Is there any code/design generator which is capable of turning a simple design document (like *a page with a navbar*) to HTML or SVG? and **open source** of course!

&#x200B;

It's far from perfect, but I now added ChatGPT and it is surprisingly good at inferring what the project is about. It often generates interesting usage examples and explains the available command line options.

&#x200B;

You probably won't yet use this for larger projects, but I think this can make sense for small projects or single scripts. Many small scripts are very useful but might never be published because of the work that is required to document and explain it. Using this AI might assist you with that.

**ChatGPT goes viral.** Launched by OpenAI on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT has attracted unprecedented attention due to its powerful abilities all over the world.  It took only 5 days \[1\] and 2 months \[2\] for ChatGPT to have 1 million users and 100 million monthly users after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history. ChatGPT can be seen as the milestone for the GPT family to go viral. In academia, ChatGPT has also inspired a large number of works discussing its applications in multiple fields, with **more than 500 papers within four months** after release and **the number is still increasing rapidly.**  This brings a huge challenge for a researcher who hopes to have an overview of ChatGPT applications or hopes to start his or her journey with ChatGPT in their own field.  **To help more people keep up with the latest progress of the GPT family,** we’re glad to share a self-contained survey that not only summarizes **the recent applications** of ChatGPT and other GPT variants like GPT-4, but also introduces the **underlying techniques** and **challenges.** Please refer to the following link for the paper: [One Small Step for Generative AI, One Giant Leap for AGI: A Complete Survey on ChatGPT in AIGC Era](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369618942_One_Small_Step_for_Generative_AI_One_Giant_Leap_for_AGI_A_Complete_Survey_on_ChatGPT_in_AIGC_Era).

&#x200B;

**From ChatGPT to Generative AI.**  One highlighting ability of the GPT family is that it can generate natural languages, which falls into the area of Generative AI. Apart from text, Generative AI can also generate content in other modalities, such as image, audio, and graph. More excitingly, Generative AI is able to convert data from one modality to another one, such as the text-to-image task (generating images from text). **To help readers have a better overview of Generative AI,** we provide a complete survey on underlying **techniques,** summary and development of **typical tasks in academia**, and also **industrial applications.** Please refer to the following link for the paper.  [A Complete Survey on Generative AI (AIGC): Is ChatGPT from GPT-4 to GPT-5 All You Need?](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369385153_A_Complete_Survey_on_Generative_AI_AIGC_Is_ChatGPT_from_GPT-4_to_GPT-5_All_You_Need)

&#x200B;

**From Generative AI to Diffusion Models.** The prosperity of a field is always driven by the development of technology, and so is Generative AI.  Different from ChatGPT which generates text based on the transformer, **diffuson models** have greatly accelerated the development of other fields in Generative AI, such as image synthesis.  Although we provide a summary of diffusion models and typical tasks in the Generative AI survey, we cannot include detailed discussions due to paper length limitations. **For those who are interested in the technical details of diffusion models and the recent progress of their applications in Generative AI,** we provide three self-contained surveys on **how diffusion models are applied in three typical areas: Text-to-image diffusion models** (also includes related tasks such as image editing)**, Audio diffusion models** (including text to speech synthesis and enhancement), and **Graph diffusion models** (including molecule, protein and material areas). Please refer to the following links for the paper.

The following is the **abstract** of the **survey on generative AI** with a summary **figure**.

As ChatGPT goes viral, generative AI (AIGC, a.k.a AI-generated content) has made headlines everywhere because of its ability to analyze and create text, images, and beyond. With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost impossible to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle.  In the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth noting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool out of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many people are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants) help ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? To answer this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is needed. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first look at AIGC, ranging from its **techniques** to **applications**. Modern generative AI relies on various technical foundations, ranging from **model architecture** and **self-supervised pretraining** to **generative modeling** methods (like GAN and diffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work focuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their output type, including **text**, **images**, **videos**, **3D content**, **etc**., which depicts the full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their significant applications in some mainstream **industries**, such as **education** and **creativity** content. Finally, we discuss the **challenges** currently faced and present an **outlook** on how generative AI might evolve in the near future.

It amazes me how much progress we've made in these fields, and the potential applications for them are seemingly endless. Although I love exploring the different areas where machine learning can have an impact, I also have some questions and would appreciate anyone's insights.

Conversely, a thought has crossed my mind regarding how these cutting-edge tools can also be used for disinformation or other negative purposes. It seems imperative that we, as a tech-savvy community, work together to ensure these tools remain positively focused and prevent them from being used to spread misinformation or other nefarious goals.

One particular area that has caught my eye is the powerful pipeline for background removal mentioned in a recent article. It utilizes the CUDA-accelerated MOG2 background segmentation algorithm and the Savant Video Analytics Framework, resulting in impressive processing speeds. I wonder, though, about the potential applications for this technology, both positive and negative.

Additionally, I came across an interesting topic on using machine learning to predict human preferences in assembly tasks. If we can successfully train robots to assist us, the implications for manufacturing, construction, and even everyday tasks could be significant. However, it begs the question of how much we should allow AI and robots to control our lives and the measures that need to be in place to ensure they remain our helpful assistants rather than our overlords.

In my quest to learn more, I stumbled upon a free deep learning course and was wondering if there are any other resources I could check out to expand my knowledge? It's crucial to comprehend the intricacies of these powerful tools to make informed decisions as a society regarding their applications and potential consequences.

I would love to hear your thoughts on the subjects and any recommendations for resources that will aid in deep learning and machine learning education. Let's work together to harness the potential of these technologies while maintaining a vigilant watch for the negative aspects that may arise.

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

The following is the **abstract** of the **survey on generative AI** with a summary **figure**.

As ChatGPT goes viral, generative AI (AIGC, a.k.a AI-generated content) has made headlines everywhere because of its ability to analyze and create text, images, and beyond. With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost impossible to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle.  In the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth noting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool out of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many people are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants) help ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? To answer this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is needed. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first look at AIGC, ranging from its **techniques** to **applications**. Modern generative AI relies on various technical foundations, ranging from **model architecture** and **self-supervised pretraining** to **generative modeling** methods (like GAN and diffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work focuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their output type, including **text**, **images**, **videos**, **3D content**, **etc**., which depicts the full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their significant applications in some mainstream **industries**, such as **education** and **creativity** content. Finally, we discuss the **challenges** currently faced and present an **outlook** on how generative AI might evolve in the near future.

**ChatGPT goes viral.** Launched by OpenAI on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT has attracted unprecedented attention due to its powerful abilities all over the world.  It took only 5 days \[1\] and 2 months \[2\] for ChatGPT to have 1 million users and 100 million monthly users after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history. ChatGPT can be seen as the milestone for the GPT family to go viral. In academia, ChatGPT has also inspired a large number of works discussing its applications in multiple fields, with **more than 500 papers within four months** after release and **the number is still increasing rapidly.**  This brings a huge challenge for a researcher who hopes to have an overview of ChatGPT applications or hopes to start his or her journey with ChatGPT in their own field.  **To help more people keep up with the latest progress of the GPT family,** we’re glad to share a self-contained survey that not only summarizes **the recent applications** of ChatGPT and other GPT variants like GPT-4, but also introduces the **underlying techniques** and **challenges.** Please refer to the following link for the paper: [One Small Step for Generative AI, One Giant Leap for AGI: A Complete Survey on ChatGPT in AIGC Era](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369618942_One_Small_Step_for_Generative_AI_One_Giant_Leap_for_AGI_A_Complete_Survey_on_ChatGPT_in_AIGC_Era).

&#x200B;

**From ChatGPT to Generative AI.**  One highlighting ability of the GPT family is that it can generate natural languages, which falls into the area of Generative AI. Apart from text, Generative AI can also generate content in other modalities, such as image, audio, and graph. More excitingly, Generative AI is able to convert data from one modality to another one, such as the text-to-image task (generating images from text). **To help readers have a better overview of Generative AI,** we provide a complete survey on underlying **techniques,** summary and development of **typical tasks in academia**, and also **industrial applications.** Please refer to the following link for the paper.

&#x200B;

**From Generative AI to Diffusion Models.** The prosperity of a field is always driven by the development of technology, and so is Generative AI.  Different from ChatGPT which generates text based on the transformer, **diffuson models** have greatly accelerated the development of other fields in Generative AI, such as image synthesis.  Although we provide a summary of diffusion models and typical tasks in the Generative AI survey, we cannot include detailed discussions due to paper length limitations. **For those who are interested in the technical details of diffusion models and the recent progress of their applications in Generative AI,** we provide three self-contained surveys on **how diffusion models are applied in three typical areas: Text-to-image diffusion models** (also includes related tasks such as image editing)**, Audio diffusion models** (including text to speech synthesis and enhancement), and **Graph diffusion models** (including molecule, protein and material areas).

I have an idea of a *sketch to design* program with deep learning and computer vision. I saw the very same concept before and I believe GPT-4 is capable of doing something similar. First, I have to say that I am familiar with the computer vision procedure. I did it [before](https://haghiri75.com/en/analyzing-components-of-an-electric-circuit-with-yolov5/) and I know using YOLO algorithms might be a good idea.

Also, I have no problems developing a ""Sketch to code"" program since I can pipe my results to another AI or code generator. But I also found [Uizard](http://uizard.io) which can turn your hand-drawn sketches into ""Design"".

It made some questions in my mind which are the following:

1. Is there any language for design? Or it's just XML, HTML or SVG coded file?
2. Is there any code/design generator which is capable of turning a simple design document (like *a page with a navbar*) to HTML or SVG? and **open source** of course!

It amazes me how much progress we've made in these fields, and the potential applications for them are seemingly endless. Although I love exploring the different areas where machine learning can have an impact, I also have some questions and would appreciate anyone's insights.

Conversely, a thought has crossed my mind regarding how these cutting-edge tools can also be used for disinformation or other negative purposes. It seems imperative that we, as a tech-savvy community, work together to ensure these tools remain positively focused and prevent them from being used to spread misinformation or other nefarious goals.

One particular area that has caught my eye is the powerful pipeline for background removal mentioned in a recent article. It utilizes the CUDA-accelerated MOG2 background segmentation algorithm and the Savant Video Analytics Framework, resulting in impressive processing speeds. I wonder, though, about the potential applications for this technology, both positive and negative.

Additionally, I came across an interesting topic on using machine learning to predict human preferences in assembly tasks. If we can successfully train robots to assist us, the implications for manufacturing, construction, and even everyday tasks could be significant. However, it begs the question of how much we should allow AI and robots to control our lives and the measures that need to be in place to ensure they remain our helpful assistants rather than our overlords.

In my quest to learn more, I stumbled upon a free deep learning course and was wondering if there are any other resources I could check out to expand my knowledge? It's crucial to comprehend the intricacies of these powerful tools to make informed decisions as a society regarding their applications and potential consequences.

I would love to hear your thoughts on the subjects and any recommendations for resources that will aid in deep learning and machine learning education. Let's work together to harness the potential of these technologies while maintaining a vigilant watch for the negative aspects that may arise.

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

*Thank you for reading!*

76,11ium8l,deeplearning,GPT-4,relevance,2023-03-05 11:10:56,LLaMA model parallelization and server configuration,ChristmasInOct,False,0.97,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/11ium8l/llama_model_parallelization_and_server/,8,1678014656.0,"Hey everyone,

First of all, tldr at bottom, typed more than expected here.  

Please excuse the rather naive perspective I have here.  I've followed along with great interest, but this is not my industry.

Regardless, I have spent the past 3-4 days falling down a brutally obsessive rabbit hole, and I cannot seem to find this information.  I'm assuming it's just that I am missing context of course, and regardless of whether there is a clear answer, I'm trying to get a better understanding of this topic so that I could better appraise the situation myself.

Really I suppose I have two questions.  **The first** is regarding model parallelization.

I'm assuming this is not generic whatsoever.  What is the typical process engineers go about for designing such a pipeline?  Specifically in regards to these new LLaMA models, is something like ALPA relevant?  Deepspeed?

More importantly, what information should I be seeking to determine this myself?

This roughly segues to my **second inquiry**.

The reason I'm curious about splitting the model pipeline etc., is that I am potentially in interested in standing a server up for this.  Although I don't have much of a budget for this build (\~$30-40K is the rough top-end, but I'd be a lot happier around $20-25K), the money is there if I can genuinely satisfy my use-case.

I work at a small, but borderline manic startup working on enterprise software; 90% of the work we're doing based in the react/node ecosystem, some low-level work for backend services, and some very interesting database work that I have very little to do with.  I am a fullstack engineer that grew up playing with C++ => C#, and somehow ended up spending all of my time r/w'ing javascript.  Lol.  Anyways.

Part of our roadmap since GPT-3 and the playground were made publicly accessible, involves usage of these transformer models, and their ability to interpret natural language inputs, whether from user inputs, or scraped input values generated somewhere in a chain of requests / operations.

Seeing GPT-3 in action made me specifically realize that my estimations on this technology had been wildly off.  Seeing ChatGPT in action and uptick, the API's becoming available, has me further panicked.

Running our inference through their API has never really been an option for us.  I haven't even really looked that far into it, but bottom line the data running through our platform is all back-office, highly sensitive business information, and many have agreements explicitly restricting the movement of data to or from any cloud services, with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google all specifically mentioned.

Regardless of the reasoning for these contracts, the LLaMA release has had me obsessed over this topic in more detail than before, and whether or not I would be able to get this setup privately, for our use-case.

**To get to the actual second inquiry**:

Say I want to throw a budget rig together for this in a server cabinet.  Am I able to effectively parallelize the LLaMA model, well enough to justify going with 24GB VRAM 4090's in the rig?  Say I do so with DeepSpeed, or some of the standard model parallelization libraries.

Is the performance cost low enough to justify taking the extra compute here over 1/3 - 1/2 as many RTX6000 ADA's?

Or should I be grabbing the 48GB ADA's?

Like I said, I apologize for the naivety, I'm really looking for more information so that I can start to put this picture together better on my own.  It really isn't the easiest topic to research with how quickly things seem to move, and the giant gap between conversation depths (gamer || phd in a lot of the most interesting or niche discussions, little between).

Thank you very much for your time.

TL;DR - Any information on LLaMA model parallelization at the moment?  Will it be compatible with things like zero or alpa?  How about for throwing a rig together right now for fine-tuning and then running inference on the LLaMA models?  48GB 6000 ADA's, or 24GB 4090's?

Planning on putting it in a mostly empty 42U cabinet that also houses our primary web server and networking hardware, so if there is a sales pitch for 4090's across multiple nodes here, I do have a massive bias as the kind of nerd that finds that kind of hardware borderline erotic.

Hydro and cooling are not an issue, just usage of the budget and understanding the requirements / approach given memory limitations, and how to avoid communication bottlenecks or even balance them against raw compute.

Thanks again everyone!"

Mostly related to prototyping statistical models and optimization problems, bringing them into production. Some experience in building pipeline and orchestration flow with AWS services.

I have basic understanding on Transformers, BERT, GPT. Did my first NLP Kaggle competition the first time recently.

I'd like my next job to be a NLP engineer. How should I prepare myself for it?

Here's some of the items I'm thinking

&#x200B;

1. More hands on projects I can put on resume, including integration with cloud services. Any recommendations on what kinds of projects I should pick?  
 
2. Tryout techniques of speeding up models like distilled model, dynamic shape, quantization. Anything else that would be helpful?  
 
3. Understand lower level of GPU programming knowledges. Not sure if this is helpful for me finding a NLP job. If so, what kind of things I can do to go deeper on this subject. I'm currently taking [Intro to Parallel Programming](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs344) CS344 course on Udemy (highly recommend btw).  
 
4. Grind leetcode :/  
 

Please point out other important directions I missed."
