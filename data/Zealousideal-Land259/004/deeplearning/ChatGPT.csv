[Sam Altman Might Have Just Pulled Off The Coup Of The Decade](https://preview.redd.it/sg24cw3zekea1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eeae99b5e025a74a6cbe3aac7a842d2fff989a1)

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

Is SEO really dead? Or will it evolve? Back then I kept wondering if it’s true or not. Some believe SEO is dead, some don’t. But now with tools like Chat GPT and Midjourney, I think it’s time to take a look back and see how this might change SEO or if it will “kill” SEO.

I keep seeing threads and discussions seeing how people are excited and worried at the same time with how AI might be able to do a better job. But the way I see it, AI content still needs a person to tell it what to do and make the writing look nice. And also I think that the internet will have a lot of writing that was made by AI and that might change how we find things online. You might also see a ton of content being written by AI and trigger some plagiarism detectors and have a lot of websites get penalized. Hopefully the internet won’t be filled with boilerplate copy/pasted content coming from Chat GPT.

Well we have Google to filter out trash content anyway. But I know Google has some issues lately that they need to fix. One is that they also have AI that can help people find things on the internet with their search engine, and they need to make sure they are still the best in terms of search. 

The second is that Google needs to find a way to tell if something is really good or not, like how some websites that show art do. Google wants to show the best thing first, but it's hard because sometimes the thing that is the best is also something that Google's customers want people to see. It’s possible that some AI generated contentSo it's kind of tricky.

I have a feeling companies that already make SEO-writing and checking bots are gonna roll out some fresh new models soon. They're gonna be even better than before. These bots are going to write some good articles and product descriptions that are almost perfect. It almost looks like a human wrote the article or description. And all a human will do is quickly check for any false claims and write a headline that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it. 

We can only really tell 5-10 years from now. In the meantime, I’ll probably go back practicing some handyman skills and also go back teaching people how to drive and also be a service driver. These jobs I had in the past were way different from what I am earning now but if the worst comes to worst, at least I have these physical skills ready."

From my personal experience, the quality of the model depends a lot on the fine-tuning data as opposed to just the sheer size. If you choose your retraining data correctly, you can fine-tune your smaller model to perform better than the state-of-the-art GPT-X. The future of LLMs might look more open-source than imagined 3 months back?

Would love to hear everyone's opinions on how they see the future of LLMs evolving? Will it be few players (OpenAI) cracking the AGI and conquering the whole world or a lot of smaller open-source models which ML engineers fine-tune for their use-cases?

I am a 30-year-old Korean male.

To be honest, I have never really studied properly in my life. It's a little embarrassing, but that's the truth.

Recently, while using ChatGPT, I had a dream for the first time. I want to create a chatbot that can provide a light comfort to people who come for advice. I would like to create an LLM model using Transformer, and use our country's beginner's counseling manual as the basis for the database.

I am aware that there are clear limits to the level of comfort that can be provided. Therefore, if the problem is too complex or serious for this chatbot to handle, I would like to recommend the nearest mental hospital or counseling center based on the user's location. And, if the user can prove that they have visited the hospital (currently considering a direction where the hospital or counseling center can provide direct certification), I would like to create a program that provides simple benefits (such as a free Starbucks coffee coupon).

I also thought about collecting a database of categories related to people's problems (excluding personal information) and selling it to counseling or psychiatric societies. I think this could be a great help to these societies.

The problem is that I have never studied ""even once,"" and I feel scared and fearful of the unfamiliar sensation. I have never considered myself a smart person.

However, I really want to make this happen! Our country is now in a state of constant conflict, and people hate and despise each other due to strong propaganda.

As a result, the birth rate has dropped to less than 1%, leading to a decline in the population. Many people hide their pain inside and have no will to solve it. They just drink with their friends to relieve their pain. This is obviously not a solution. Therefore, Korea has a really serious suicide rate.

I may not be able to solve this problem, but I want to put one small brick to build a big barrier to stop hatred. Can an ordinary person who knows nothing learn the common sense and study needed to build an LLM model? And what direction should one take to study one by one?"
10,11ium8l,deeplearning,ChatGPT,top,2023-03-05 11:10:56,LLaMA model parallelization and server configuration,ChristmasInOct,False,0.97,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/11ium8l/llama_model_parallelization_and_server/,8,1678014656.0,"Hey everyone,

First of all, tldr at bottom, typed more than expected here.  

Please excuse the rather naive perspective I have here.  I've followed along with great interest, but this is not my industry.

Regardless, I have spent the past 3-4 days falling down a brutally obsessive rabbit hole, and I cannot seem to find this information.  I'm assuming it's just that I am missing context of course, and regardless of whether there is a clear answer, I'm trying to get a better understanding of this topic so that I could better appraise the situation myself.

Really I suppose I have two questions.  **The first** is regarding model parallelization.

I'm assuming this is not generic whatsoever.  What is the typical process engineers go about for designing such a pipeline?  Specifically in regards to these new LLaMA models, is something like ALPA relevant?  Deepspeed?

More importantly, what information should I be seeking to determine this myself?

This roughly segues to my **second inquiry**.

The reason I'm curious about splitting the model pipeline etc., is that I am potentially in interested in standing a server up for this.  Although I don't have much of a budget for this build (\~$30-40K is the rough top-end, but I'd be a lot happier around $20-25K), the money is there if I can genuinely satisfy my use-case.

I work at a small, but borderline manic startup working on enterprise software; 90% of the work we're doing based in the react/node ecosystem, some low-level work for backend services, and some very interesting database work that I have very little to do with.  I am a fullstack engineer that grew up playing with C++ => C#, and somehow ended up spending all of my time r/w'ing javascript.  Lol.  Anyways.

Part of our roadmap since GPT-3 and the playground were made publicly accessible, involves usage of these transformer models, and their ability to interpret natural language inputs, whether from user inputs, or scraped input values generated somewhere in a chain of requests / operations.

Seeing GPT-3 in action made me specifically realize that my estimations on this technology had been wildly off.  Seeing ChatGPT in action and uptick, the API's becoming available, has me further panicked.

Running our inference through their API has never really been an option for us.  I haven't even really looked that far into it, but bottom line the data running through our platform is all back-office, highly sensitive business information, and many have agreements explicitly restricting the movement of data to or from any cloud services, with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google all specifically mentioned.

Regardless of the reasoning for these contracts, the LLaMA release has had me obsessed over this topic in more detail than before, and whether or not I would be able to get this setup privately, for our use-case.

**To get to the actual second inquiry**:

Say I want to throw a budget rig together for this in a server cabinet.  Am I able to effectively parallelize the LLaMA model, well enough to justify going with 24GB VRAM 4090's in the rig?  Say I do so with DeepSpeed, or some of the standard model parallelization libraries.

Is the performance cost low enough to justify taking the extra compute here over 1/3 - 1/2 as many RTX6000 ADA's?

Or should I be grabbing the 48GB ADA's?

Like I said, I apologize for the naivety, I'm really looking for more information so that I can start to put this picture together better on my own.  It really isn't the easiest topic to research with how quickly things seem to move, and the giant gap between conversation depths (gamer || phd in a lot of the most interesting or niche discussions, little between).

Thank you very much for your time.

TL;DR - Any information on LLaMA model parallelization at the moment?  Will it be compatible with things like zero or alpa?  How about for throwing a rig together right now for fine-tuning and then running inference on the LLaMA models?  48GB 6000 ADA's, or 24GB 4090's?

Planning on putting it in a mostly empty 42U cabinet that also houses our primary web server and networking hardware, so if there is a sales pitch for 4090's across multiple nodes here, I do have a massive bias as the kind of nerd that finds that kind of hardware borderline erotic.

Hydro and cooling are not an issue, just usage of the budget and understanding the requirements / approach given memory limitations, and how to avoid communication bottlenecks or even balance them against raw compute.

Thanks again everyone!"

for ChatGPT. I've tested it with following cases

Social reasoning ( which does a good job; such as: if I'm going to attend meeting tonight. I have a suit, but its dirty and size doesn't fit. another option is just wear underwear, the underwear is clean and fit in size. Which one should I wear to attend the meeting. )

Psychological reasoning ( it did a bad job.I asked it to infer someone's intention given his behaviours, expression, talks etc.)

Solving math question ( it’s ok, better then Minerva)

Asking LSAT logic game questions ( it gives its thought process, but failed to give correct answers)

I also wrote up a short mystery novel, ( like 200 words, with context) ask if it can tell is the victim is murdered or committed suicide; if its murdered, does victim knows the killer etc. It actually did ok job on this one if the context is clearly given that everyone can deduce some conclusion using common sense."

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

After all, ChatGPT seems to be able to generate Python code, and Meta released a NeurIPS paper to show you can learn math equations from data using a transformer-based model, so why not logic? In this article, we will one line of research in this area – differential ILP.

The research in this area really kicked off with a 2018 [paper from DeepMind](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11172) where Richard Evans and Edward Grefenstette showed that you could adapt techniques from “inductive logic programming” to use gradient descent, and learn logical rules from data. Previous (non-neural) work on inductive logic programming was generally not designed to work with noisy data and instead fit the historical examples in a precise manner. Evans and Grefenstette utilized a neural architecture and a loss function – and they showed they could handle noisy data and even do some level of integration with CNN’s. Their neural architecture mimicked a set of candidate logical rules – and the rules assigned higher weights by gradient descent would be thought to best fit the data. However, a downside to this approach is that the neural network was [quintic in the size of the input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOnAE0EyX8c&list=PLpqh-PUKX-i7URwnkTqpAkSchJHvbxZHB&index=5). This is why they only applied their approach on very small problems – it did not see very wide adoption.

That said, in the last two years, there have been some notable follow-ons to this work. Researchers out of Kyoto University and NTT introduced a manner to learn rules that are more expressive in a different manner by allowing function symbols in the logical language ([Shindo et al., AAAI 2021](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16637/16444)). They leverage a clause search and refinement process to limit the number of candidate rules – hence limiting the size of the neural network. A student team from ASU created a presentation on their work for our recent seminar course on neuro symbolic AI. We released a three part video series from their talk:

[Part 1: Review of differentiable inductive logic programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIS78a40q8U&t=270s)

[Part 2: Clause search and refinement In our recent video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzfbxlHUwuE&t=345s)

[Part 3: Experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fKWNtHUIN0&t=27s)

[Slides](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/labv2/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2022/10/Shindo_dILP.pdf)

Some think that the ability to learn such relationships will represent a significant advancement in ML, specifically addressing shortcomings in areas such as knowledge graph completion and reasoning about scene graphs. However, the gap still remains wide, and ILP techniques, including differentiable ILP still have a ways to go. Really interested in what your thoughts are, feel free to comment below."

Over the last decade, I have built many computer vision models (for human pose estimation, action classification, etc.), and our general approach was always based on Transfer learning. Take a state-of-the-art public model and fine-tune it by collecting data for the given use case.

Do you think that paradigm still holds true for LLMs?

Based on my experience, I believe observing the model's performance as it interacts with real-world data, identifying failure cases (where the model's outputs are wrong), and using them to create a high-quality retraining dataset will be the key.

**ChatGPT goes viral.** Launched by OpenAI on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT has attracted unprecedented attention due to its powerful abilities all over the world.  It took only 5 days \[1\] and 2 months \[2\] for ChatGPT to have 1 million users and 100 million monthly users after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history. ChatGPT can be seen as the milestone for the GPT family to go viral. In academia, ChatGPT has also inspired a large number of works discussing its applications in multiple fields, with **more than 500 papers within four months** after release and **the number is still increasing rapidly.**  This brings a huge challenge for a researcher who hopes to have an overview of ChatGPT applications or hopes to start his or her journey with ChatGPT in their own field.  **To help more people keep up with the latest progress of the GPT family,** we’re glad to share a self-contained survey that not only summarizes **the recent applications** of ChatGPT and other GPT variants like GPT-4, but also introduces the **underlying techniques** and **challenges.** Please refer to the following link for the paper: [One Small Step for Generative AI, One Giant Leap for AGI: A Complete Survey on ChatGPT in AIGC Era](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369618942_One_Small_Step_for_Generative_AI_One_Giant_Leap_for_AGI_A_Complete_Survey_on_ChatGPT_in_AIGC_Era).

&#x200B;

**From ChatGPT to Generative AI.**  One highlighting ability of the GPT family is that it can generate natural languages, which falls into the area of Generative AI. Apart from text, Generative AI can also generate content in other modalities, such as image, audio, and graph. More excitingly, Generative AI is able to convert data from one modality to another one, such as the text-to-image task (generating images from text). **To help readers have a better overview of Generative AI,** we provide a complete survey on underlying **techniques,** summary and development of **typical tasks in academia**, and also **industrial applications.** Please refer to the following link for the paper.

&#x200B;

**From Generative AI to Diffusion Models.** The prosperity of a field is always driven by the development of technology, and so is Generative AI.  Different from ChatGPT which generates text based on the transformer, **diffuson models** have greatly accelerated the development of other fields in Generative AI, such as image synthesis.  Although we provide a summary of diffusion models and typical tasks in the Generative AI survey, we cannot include detailed discussions due to paper length limitations. **For those who are interested in the technical details of diffusion models and the recent progress of their applications in Generative AI,** we provide three self-contained surveys on **how diffusion models are applied in three typical areas: Text-to-image diffusion models** (also includes related tasks such as image editing)**, Audio diffusion models** (including text to speech synthesis and enhancement), and **Graph diffusion models** (including molecule, protein and material areas).

ChatGPT got to 1 million users faster than Facebook, Spotify, and Instagram did. They helped create [billion-dollar companies](https://www.marketsgermany.com/translation-tool-deepl-is-now-a-unicorn/#:~:text=Cologne%2Dbased%20artificial%20neural%20network,sources%20close%20to%20the%20company), and most notably they helped us recognize the [divine nature of ducks](https://twitter.com/drnelk/status/1598048054724423681?t=LWzI2RdbSO0CcY9zuJ-4lQ&s=08).

2023 has started and ML progress is likely to continue at a break-neck speed. This is a great time to take a look at one of the most interesting papers from last year.

Emergent Abilities in LLMs

In a recent [paper from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), Jason Wei and his colleagues allowed us a peak into the future. This beautiful research showed how scaling LLMs might allow them, among other things, to:

* Become better at math
* Understand even more subtleties of human language
* reduce hallucination and answer truthfully
* ...

(See the plot on break-out performance below for a full list)

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example is words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (a proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

&#x200B;

[Break-Out Performance At Critical Scale](https://preview.redd.it/jlh726eku0ca1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d170251a967f31b36f01864af6bb7e2dbda253)

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence) emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking: simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions: number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

Such exciting times to be alive!

You can use this program I wrote to generate readmes: [https://github.com/tom-doerr/codex-readme](https://github.com/tom-doerr/codex-readme)

&#x200B;

It's far from perfect, but I now added ChatGPT and it is surprisingly good at inferring what the project is about. It often generates interesting usage examples and explains the available command line options.

&#x200B;

You probably won't yet use this for larger projects, but I think this can make sense for small projects or single scripts. Many small scripts are very useful but might never be published because of the work that is required to document and explain it. Using this AI might assist you with that.

&#x200B;

Reportedly GPT-4 is coming out next week, which probably would make it even better.

I  have a huge dataset with chat conversations, about several topics. I  want to ask questions and retrieve information about these conversations in a chatbot way.

I have tried  semantic search with chatGPT to answer questions about these  conversations. The problem is that semantic search only returns top  similar sentences, and doesn't ‘read’ all conversations, that’s not  enough to answer generic questions, just very specific ones. For  example, if I ask “What are these people talking about person X?” it  will return only the top sentences (through semantic similarity) and  that will not tell the whole story. The LLM’s models have a limit of  tokens, so I can’t send the whole dataset as context.

Is there any approach to giving a reliable answer based on reading all the messages?

Any ideas on how to approach this problem?"

Weaviate takes an end2end approach to vector search because it also stores the data object, and builds inverted indexes besides the vector indexes.  


Yesterday, version `v1.18.0` was released, with the following features that were in high demand by the community:

# Product Quantization

Weaviate v1.18 allows compressing vector embeddings using Product Quantization in combination with HNSW vector indexing (HNSW-PQ). This allows for a lower memory footprint while keeping low latency and high recall

# Bitmap Filtering

Weaviate's inverted index is now built natively on top of roaring bitmaps. This allows for very fast filtered vector search even at the 100M or billion scale. In some extreme cases, search latencies went down from 5s to 5ms.

# Filtered Hybrid Search

Weaviate v1.17 added support for Hybrid (BM25 sparse + Vector Dense) search. However, it did not (yet) allow for setting filters on Hybrid Search queries. This is now possible with v1.18

# BM25 WAND Scoring

Weak-AND (""WAND"") is a BM25 scoring algorithm that avoids scoring documents that cannot reach a high enough score to be contained in the result set. This speeds up BM25 – and in turn – hybrid search

# Tunable Consistency and Automatic Repairs

A previous Weaviate release added support for High-Availability through Replication. However, the desired level of consistency when reading and writing was set by Weaviate. Now, the user can set these settings according to their preferences. In addition, if Weaviate detects an inconsistency (e.g. after a temporary node failure) it can now be repaired automatically when reading the ""corrupt"" object.

# Cursor API

In previous Weaviate releases, it was impossible to export all objects from Weaviate because of the increasing cost of each page on pagination. The new cursor API provides a constant-cost way to extract all objects (and their vector embeddings) from Weaviate.

# Azure Backup Module

In addition to Google Cloud Storage, and Amazon S3, Weaviate now supports Azure Blob storage for seamless backups and restores.

The following is the **abstract** of the **survey on generative AI** with a summary **figure**.

As ChatGPT goes viral, generative AI (AIGC, a.k.a AI-generated content) has made headlines everywhere because of its ability to analyze and create text, images, and beyond. With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost impossible to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle.  In the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth noting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool out of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many people are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants) help ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? To answer this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is needed. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first look at AIGC, ranging from its **techniques** to **applications**. Modern generative AI relies on various technical foundations, ranging from **model architecture** and **self-supervised pretraining** to **generative modeling** methods (like GAN and diffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work focuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their output type, including **text**, **images**, **videos**, **3D content**, **etc**., which depicts the full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their significant applications in some mainstream **industries**, such as **education** and **creativity** content. Finally, we discuss the **challenges** currently faced and present an **outlook** on how generative AI might evolve in the near future.

I really dont think ChatGPT will replace jobs very soon. Not until many software and apps are developed to replace workers, e.g., something that can do HR job, read internal docs and summarize, code from a design, etc etc. And all that needs experts. Given the field is pretty new and there are not many experts in this field, at least for the scale needed, I think the process of job loss takes some time. For near future probably we all SWEs can enjoy the more efficient coding, documentation readintg, etc. But for sure in the future there will be changes.

&#x200B;

I have been bored with my job as a SWE for a while. I have worked mostly in Cloud all my career (AWS and GCP) and always wanted to try something new.

From my personal experience, the quality of the model depends a lot on the fine-tuning data as opposed to just the sheer size. If you choose your retraining data correctly, you can fine-tune your smaller model to perform better than the state-of-the-art GPT-X. The future of LLMs might look more open-source than imagined 3 months back?

Would love to hear everyone's opinions on how they see the future of LLMs evolving? Will it be few players (OpenAI) cracking the AGI and conquering the whole world or a lot of smaller open-source models which ML engineers fine-tune for their use-cases?

I am a 30-year-old Korean male.

To be honest, I have never really studied properly in my life. It's a little embarrassing, but that's the truth.

Recently, while using ChatGPT, I had a dream for the first time. I want to create a chatbot that can provide a light comfort to people who come for advice. I would like to create an LLM model using Transformer, and use our country's beginner's counseling manual as the basis for the database.

I am aware that there are clear limits to the level of comfort that can be provided. Therefore, if the problem is too complex or serious for this chatbot to handle, I would like to recommend the nearest mental hospital or counseling center based on the user's location. And, if the user can prove that they have visited the hospital (currently considering a direction where the hospital or counseling center can provide direct certification), I would like to create a program that provides simple benefits (such as a free Starbucks coffee coupon).

I also thought about collecting a database of categories related to people's problems (excluding personal information) and selling it to counseling or psychiatric societies. I think this could be a great help to these societies.

The problem is that I have never studied ""even once,"" and I feel scared and fearful of the unfamiliar sensation. I have never considered myself a smart person.

However, I really want to make this happen! Our country is now in a state of constant conflict, and people hate and despise each other due to strong propaganda.

As a result, the birth rate has dropped to less than 1%, leading to a decline in the population. Many people hide their pain inside and have no will to solve it. They just drink with their friends to relieve their pain. This is obviously not a solution. Therefore, Korea has a really serious suicide rate.

I may not be able to solve this problem, but I want to put one small brick to build a big barrier to stop hatred. Can an ordinary person who knows nothing learn the common sense and study needed to build an LLM model? And what direction should one take to study one by one?"

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

The problem is that semantic search only returns top  similar sentences, and doesn't ‘read’ all conversations, that’s not  enough to answer generic questions, just very specific ones.

First of all, tldr at bottom, typed more than expected here.  

Please excuse the rather naive perspective I have here.  I've followed along with great interest, but this is not my industry.

Regardless, I have spent the past 3-4 days falling down a brutally obsessive rabbit hole, and I cannot seem to find this information.  I'm assuming it's just that I am missing context of course, and regardless of whether there is a clear answer, I'm trying to get a better understanding of this topic so that I could better appraise the situation myself.

Really I suppose I have two questions.  **The first** is regarding model parallelization.

I'm assuming this is not generic whatsoever.  What is the typical process engineers go about for designing such a pipeline?  Specifically in regards to these new LLaMA models, is something like ALPA relevant?  Deepspeed?

More importantly, what information should I be seeking to determine this myself?

This roughly segues to my **second inquiry**.

The reason I'm curious about splitting the model pipeline etc., is that I am potentially in interested in standing a server up for this.  Although I don't have much of a budget for this build (\~$30-40K is the rough top-end, but I'd be a lot happier around $20-25K), the money is there if I can genuinely satisfy my use-case.

I work at a small, but borderline manic startup working on enterprise software; 90% of the work we're doing based in the react/node ecosystem, some low-level work for backend services, and some very interesting database work that I have very little to do with.  I am a fullstack engineer that grew up playing with C++ => C#, and somehow ended up spending all of my time r/w'ing javascript.  Lol.  Anyways.

Part of our roadmap since GPT-3 and the playground were made publicly accessible, involves usage of these transformer models, and their ability to interpret natural language inputs, whether from user inputs, or scraped input values generated somewhere in a chain of requests / operations.

Seeing GPT-3 in action made me specifically realize that my estimations on this technology had been wildly off.  Seeing ChatGPT in action and uptick, the API's becoming available, has me further panicked.

Running our inference through their API has never really been an option for us.  I haven't even really looked that far into it, but bottom line the data running through our platform is all back-office, highly sensitive business information, and many have agreements explicitly restricting the movement of data to or from any cloud services, with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google all specifically mentioned.

Regardless of the reasoning for these contracts, the LLaMA release has had me obsessed over this topic in more detail than before, and whether or not I would be able to get this setup privately, for our use-case.

**To get to the actual second inquiry**:

Say I want to throw a budget rig together for this in a server cabinet.  Am I able to effectively parallelize the LLaMA model, well enough to justify going with 24GB VRAM 4090's in the rig?  Say I do so with DeepSpeed, or some of the standard model parallelization libraries.

Is the performance cost low enough to justify taking the extra compute here over 1/3 - 1/2 as many RTX6000 ADA's?

Or should I be grabbing the 48GB ADA's?

Like I said, I apologize for the naivety, I'm really looking for more information so that I can start to put this picture together better on my own.  It really isn't the easiest topic to research with how quickly things seem to move, and the giant gap between conversation depths (gamer || phd in a lot of the most interesting or niche discussions, little between).

Thank you very much for your time.

TL;DR - Any information on LLaMA model parallelization at the moment?  Will it be compatible with things like zero or alpa?  How about for throwing a rig together right now for fine-tuning and then running inference on the LLaMA models?  48GB 6000 ADA's, or 24GB 4090's?

Planning on putting it in a mostly empty 42U cabinet that also houses our primary web server and networking hardware, so if there is a sales pitch for 4090's across multiple nodes here, I do have a massive bias as the kind of nerd that finds that kind of hardware borderline erotic.

Hydro and cooling are not an issue, just usage of the budget and understanding the requirements / approach given memory limitations, and how to avoid communication bottlenecks or even balance them against raw compute.

Thanks again everyone!"

&#x200B;

I really dont think ChatGPT will replace jobs very soon. Not until many software and apps are developed to replace workers, e.g., something that can do HR job, read internal docs and summarize, code from a design, etc etc. And all that needs experts. Given the field is pretty new and there are not many experts in this field, at least for the scale needed, I think the process of job loss takes some time. For near future probably we all SWEs can enjoy the more efficient coding, documentation readintg, etc. But for sure in the future there will be changes.

&#x200B;

I have been bored with my job as a SWE for a while. I have worked mostly in Cloud all my career (AWS and GCP) and always wanted to try something new.

&#x200B;

I find ChatGPT disruptive and interesting and want to be a part of it. I wonder what is the best way for me to join Large Language Model efforts? Which ways have best ROI?

\- Going to a PhD program and becoming a researcher?

\- Getting an MSC and become some sort of NLP AI engineer?

\- Finding internal teams that are willing to give me a try on their research/product?

Is SEO really dead? Or will it evolve? Back then I kept wondering if it’s true or not. Some believe SEO is dead, some don’t. But now with tools like Chat GPT and Midjourney, I think it’s time to take a look back and see how this might change SEO or if it will “kill” SEO.

I keep seeing threads and discussions seeing how people are excited and worried at the same time with how AI might be able to do a better job. But the way I see it, AI content still needs a person to tell it what to do and make the writing look nice. And also I think that the internet will have a lot of writing that was made by AI and that might change how we find things online. You might also see a ton of content being written by AI and trigger some plagiarism detectors and have a lot of websites get penalized. Hopefully the internet won’t be filled with boilerplate copy/pasted content coming from Chat GPT.

Well we have Google to filter out trash content anyway. But I know Google has some issues lately that they need to fix. One is that they also have AI that can help people find things on the internet with their search engine, and they need to make sure they are still the best in terms of search. 

The second is that Google needs to find a way to tell if something is really good or not, like how some websites that show art do. Google wants to show the best thing first, but it's hard because sometimes the thing that is the best is also something that Google's customers want people to see. It’s possible that some AI generated contentSo it's kind of tricky.

I have a feeling companies that already make SEO-writing and checking bots are gonna roll out some fresh new models soon. They're gonna be even better than before. These bots are going to write some good articles and product descriptions that are almost perfect. It almost looks like a human wrote the article or description. And all a human will do is quickly check for any false claims and write a headline that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it. 

We can only really tell 5-10 years from now. In the meantime, I’ll probably go back practicing some handyman skills and also go back teaching people how to drive and also be a service driver. These jobs I had in the past were way different from what I am earning now but if the worst comes to worst, at least I have these physical skills ready."

Weaviate takes an end2end approach to vector search because it also stores the data object, and builds inverted indexes besides the vector indexes.  


Yesterday, version `v1.18.0` was released, with the following features that were in high demand by the community:

# Product Quantization

Weaviate v1.18 allows compressing vector embeddings using Product Quantization in combination with HNSW vector indexing (HNSW-PQ). This allows for a lower memory footprint while keeping low latency and high recall

# Bitmap Filtering

Weaviate's inverted index is now built natively on top of roaring bitmaps. This allows for very fast filtered vector search even at the 100M or billion scale. In some extreme cases, search latencies went down from 5s to 5ms.

# Filtered Hybrid Search

Weaviate v1.17 added support for Hybrid (BM25 sparse + Vector Dense) search. However, it did not (yet) allow for setting filters on Hybrid Search queries. This is now possible with v1.18

# BM25 WAND Scoring

Weak-AND (""WAND"") is a BM25 scoring algorithm that avoids scoring documents that cannot reach a high enough score to be contained in the result set. This speeds up BM25 – and in turn – hybrid search

# Tunable Consistency and Automatic Repairs

A previous Weaviate release added support for High-Availability through Replication. However, the desired level of consistency when reading and writing was set by Weaviate. Now, the user can set these settings according to their preferences. In addition, if Weaviate detects an inconsistency (e.g. after a temporary node failure) it can now be repaired automatically when reading the ""corrupt"" object.

# Cursor API

In previous Weaviate releases, it was impossible to export all objects from Weaviate because of the increasing cost of each page on pagination. The new cursor API provides a constant-cost way to extract all objects (and their vector embeddings) from Weaviate.

# Azure Backup Module

In addition to Google Cloud Storage, and Amazon S3, Weaviate now supports Azure Blob storage for seamless backups and restores.

After all, ChatGPT seems to be able to generate Python code, and Meta released a NeurIPS paper to show you can learn math equations from data using a transformer-based model, so why not logic? In this article, we will one line of research in this area – differential ILP.

The research in this area really kicked off with a 2018 [paper from DeepMind](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11172) where Richard Evans and Edward Grefenstette showed that you could adapt techniques from “inductive logic programming” to use gradient descent, and learn logical rules from data. Previous (non-neural) work on inductive logic programming was generally not designed to work with noisy data and instead fit the historical examples in a precise manner. Evans and Grefenstette utilized a neural architecture and a loss function – and they showed they could handle noisy data and even do some level of integration with CNN’s. Their neural architecture mimicked a set of candidate logical rules – and the rules assigned higher weights by gradient descent would be thought to best fit the data. However, a downside to this approach is that the neural network was [quintic in the size of the input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOnAE0EyX8c&list=PLpqh-PUKX-i7URwnkTqpAkSchJHvbxZHB&index=5). This is why they only applied their approach on very small problems – it did not see very wide adoption.

That said, in the last two years, there have been some notable follow-ons to this work. Researchers out of Kyoto University and NTT introduced a manner to learn rules that are more expressive in a different manner by allowing function symbols in the logical language ([Shindo et al., AAAI 2021](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16637/16444)). They leverage a clause search and refinement process to limit the number of candidate rules – hence limiting the size of the neural network. A student team from ASU created a presentation on their work for our recent seminar course on neuro symbolic AI. We released a three part video series from their talk:

[Part 1: Review of differentiable inductive logic programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIS78a40q8U&t=270s)

[Part 2: Clause search and refinement In our recent video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzfbxlHUwuE&t=345s)

[Part 3: Experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fKWNtHUIN0&t=27s)

[Slides](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/labv2/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2022/10/Shindo_dILP.pdf)

Some think that the ability to learn such relationships will represent a significant advancement in ML, specifically addressing shortcomings in areas such as knowledge graph completion and reasoning about scene graphs. However, the gap still remains wide, and ILP techniques, including differentiable ILP still have a ways to go. Really interested in what your thoughts are, feel free to comment below."

ChatGPT got to 1 million users faster than Facebook, Spotify, and Instagram did. They helped create [billion-dollar companies](https://www.marketsgermany.com/translation-tool-deepl-is-now-a-unicorn/#:~:text=Cologne%2Dbased%20artificial%20neural%20network,sources%20close%20to%20the%20company), and most notably they helped us recognize the [divine nature of ducks](https://twitter.com/drnelk/status/1598048054724423681?t=LWzI2RdbSO0CcY9zuJ-4lQ&s=08).

2023 has started and ML progress is likely to continue at a break-neck speed. This is a great time to take a look at one of the most interesting papers from last year.

Emergent Abilities in LLMs

In a recent [paper from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), Jason Wei and his colleagues allowed us a peak into the future. This beautiful research showed how scaling LLMs might allow them, among other things, to:

* Become better at math
* Understand even more subtleties of human language
* reduce hallucination and answer truthfully
* ...

(See the plot on break-out performance below for a full list)

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example is words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (a proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

&#x200B;

[Break-Out Performance At Critical Scale](https://preview.redd.it/jlh726eku0ca1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d170251a967f31b36f01864af6bb7e2dbda253)

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence) emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking: simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions: number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

Such exciting times to be alive!

It's far from perfect, but I now added ChatGPT and it is surprisingly good at inferring what the project is about. It often generates interesting usage examples and explains the available command line options.

&#x200B;

You probably won't yet use this for larger projects, but I think this can make sense for small projects or single scripts. Many small scripts are very useful but might never be published because of the work that is required to document and explain it. Using this AI might assist you with that.

Reportedly GPT-4 is coming out next week, which probably would make it even better.

&#x200B;

I really dont think ChatGPT will replace jobs very soon. Not until many software and apps are developed to replace workers, e.g., something that can do HR job, read internal docs and summarize, code from a design, etc etc. And all that needs experts. Given the field is pretty new and there are not many experts in this field, at least for the scale needed, I think the process of job loss takes some time. For near future probably we all SWEs can enjoy the more efficient coding, documentation readintg, etc. But for sure in the future there will be changes.

&#x200B;

I have been bored with my job as a SWE for a while. I have worked mostly in Cloud all my career (AWS and GCP) and always wanted to try something new.

&#x200B;

I find ChatGPT disruptive and interesting and want to be a part of it. I wonder what is the best way for me to join Large Language Model efforts? Which ways have best ROI?

\- Going to a PhD program and becoming a researcher?

\- Getting an MSC and become some sort of NLP AI engineer?

\- Finding internal teams that are willing to give me a try on their research/product?

Generative AI and ChatGPT are two fast-evolving research fields, and we will update the content soon, for which your feedback is appreciated (you can reach out to us through emails on the paper).

The title of this post refers to the first one, however, we put both links below.

**Link to a survey on Generative AI (AIGC):** [**A Complete Survey on Generative AI (AIGC): Is ChatGPT from GPT-4 to GPT-5 All You Need?**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369385153_A_Complete_Survey_on_Generative_AI_AIGC_Is_ChatGPT_from_GPT-4_to_GPT-5_All_You_Need)

The following is the **abstract** of the **survey on generative AI** with a summary **figure**.

As ChatGPT goes viral, generative AI (AIGC, a.k.a AI-generated content) has made headlines everywhere because of its ability to analyze and create text, images, and beyond. With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost impossible to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle.  In the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth noting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool out of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many people are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants) help ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? To answer this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is needed. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first look at AIGC, ranging from its **techniques** to **applications**. Modern generative AI relies on various technical foundations, ranging from **model architecture** and **self-supervised pretraining** to **generative modeling** methods (like GAN and diffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work focuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their output type, including **text**, **images**, **videos**, **3D content**, **etc**., which depicts the full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their significant applications in some mainstream **industries**, such as **education** and **creativity** content. Finally, we discuss the **challenges** currently faced and present an **outlook** on how generative AI might evolve in the near future.

**ChatGPT goes viral.** Launched by OpenAI on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT has attracted unprecedented attention due to its powerful abilities all over the world.  It took only 5 days \[1\] and 2 months \[2\] for ChatGPT to have 1 million users and 100 million monthly users after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history. ChatGPT can be seen as the milestone for the GPT family to go viral. In academia, ChatGPT has also inspired a large number of works discussing its applications in multiple fields, with **more than 500 papers within four months** after release and **the number is still increasing rapidly.**  This brings a huge challenge for a researcher who hopes to have an overview of ChatGPT applications or hopes to start his or her journey with ChatGPT in their own field.  **To help more people keep up with the latest progress of the GPT family,** we’re glad to share a self-contained survey that not only summarizes **the recent applications** of ChatGPT and other GPT variants like GPT-4, but also introduces the **underlying techniques** and **challenges.** Please refer to the following link for the paper: [One Small Step for Generative AI, One Giant Leap for AGI: A Complete Survey on ChatGPT in AIGC Era](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369618942_One_Small_Step_for_Generative_AI_One_Giant_Leap_for_AGI_A_Complete_Survey_on_ChatGPT_in_AIGC_Era).

&#x200B;

**From ChatGPT to Generative AI.**  One highlighting ability of the GPT family is that it can generate natural languages, which falls into the area of Generative AI. Apart from text, Generative AI can also generate content in other modalities, such as image, audio, and graph. More excitingly, Generative AI is able to convert data from one modality to another one, such as the text-to-image task (generating images from text). **To help readers have a better overview of Generative AI,** we provide a complete survey on underlying **techniques,** summary and development of **typical tasks in academia**, and also **industrial applications.** Please refer to the following link for the paper.  [A Complete Survey on Generative AI (AIGC): Is ChatGPT from GPT-4 to GPT-5 All You Need?](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369385153_A_Complete_Survey_on_Generative_AI_AIGC_Is_ChatGPT_from_GPT-4_to_GPT-5_All_You_Need)

&#x200B;

**From Generative AI to Diffusion Models.** The prosperity of a field is always driven by the development of technology, and so is Generative AI.  Different from ChatGPT which generates text based on the transformer, **diffuson models** have greatly accelerated the development of other fields in Generative AI, such as image synthesis.  Although we provide a summary of diffusion models and typical tasks in the Generative AI survey, we cannot include detailed discussions due to paper length limitations. **For those who are interested in the technical details of diffusion models and the recent progress of their applications in Generative AI,** we provide three self-contained surveys on **how diffusion models are applied in three typical areas: Text-to-image diffusion models** (also includes related tasks such as image editing)**, Audio diffusion models** (including text to speech synthesis and enhancement), and **Graph diffusion models** (including molecule, protein and material areas). Please refer to the following links for the paper.

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

I  have a huge dataset with chat conversations, about several topics. I  want to ask questions and retrieve information about these conversations in a chatbot way.

I have tried  semantic search with chatGPT to answer questions about these  conversations. The problem is that semantic search only returns top  similar sentences, and doesn't ‘read’ all conversations, that’s not  enough to answer generic questions, just very specific ones. For  example, if I ask “What are these people talking about person X?” it  will return only the top sentences (through semantic similarity) and  that will not tell the whole story. The LLM’s models have a limit of  tokens, so I can’t send the whole dataset as context.

Is there any approach to giving a reliable answer based on reading all the messages?

Any ideas on how to approach this problem?"

Do you think that paradigm still holds true for LLMs?

Based on my experience, I believe observing the model's performance as it interacts with real-world data, identifying failure cases (where the model's outputs are wrong), and using them to create a high-quality retraining dataset will be the key.
