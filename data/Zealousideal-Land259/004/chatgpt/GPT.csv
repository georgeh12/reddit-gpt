All gone.  Some of them admitted that I am obviously better than chat GPT, but $0 overhead can't be beat and is worth the decrease in quality. 

I am also an independent author, and as I currently write my next series, I can't help feel silly that in just a couple years (or less!), authoring will be replaced by machines for all but the most famous and well known names. 

I think the most painful part of this is seeing so many people on here say things like, ""nah, just adapt. You'll be fine.""

Adapt to what??? It's an uphill battle against a creature that has already replaced me and continues to improve and adapt faster than any human could ever keep up. 

I'm 34. I went to school for writing. I have published countless articles and multiple novels. I thought my writing would keep sustaining my family and me, but that's over. I'm seriously thinking about becoming a plumber as I'm hoping that won't get replaced any time remotely soon. 

Everyone saying the government will pass UBI. Lol. They can't even handle providing all people with basic Healthcare or giving women a few guaranteed weeks off work (at a bare minimum) after exploding a baby out of their body. They didn't even pass a law to ensure that shelves were restocked with baby formula when there was a shortage. They just let babies die. They don't care. But you think they will pass a UBI lol?

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the responses. Many of you have bolstered my decision to become a plumber, and that really does seem like the most pragmatic, future-proof option for the sake of my family. Everything else involving an uphill battle in the writing industry against competition that grows exponentially smarter and faster with each passing day just seems like an unwise decision.  As I said in many of my comments, I was raised by my grandpa, who was a plumber, so I'm not a total noob at it. I do all my own plumbing around my house. I feel more confident in this decision. Thank you everyone! 

Also, I will continue to write. I have been writing and spinning tales since before I could form memory (according to my mom). I was just excited about growing my independent authoring into a more profitable venture, especially with the release of my new series. That doesn't seem like a wise investment of time anymore. Over the last five months, I wrote and revised 2 books of a new 9 book series I'm working on, and I plan to write the next 3 while I transition my life. My editor and beta-readers love them. I will release those at the end of the year, and then I think it is time to move on. It is just too big of a gamble. It always was, but now more than ever. I will probably just write much less and won't invest money into marketing and art. For me, writing is like taking a shit: I don't have a choice. 

Again, thank you everyone for your responses. I feel more confident about the future and becoming a plumber!

Edit 2: Thank you again to everyone for messaging me and leaving suggestions. You are all amazing people. All the best to everyone, and good luck out there! I feel very clear-headed about what I need to do. Thank you again!!"

Using GPT, she has launched [CarynAI](https://caryn.ai), an AI representation of herself offering virtual companionship at a rate of $1 per minute. 

Key points about CarynAI and its success so far:

* Caryn has a substantial follower base on Snapchat, with **1.8 million followers**.
* In just **1 week**, over **1,000 virtual boyfriends** have signed up to interact with the AI, generating over **$71,610**.
* Some estimates suggests that if even **1%** of her **1.8 million followers** subscribe to CarynAI, she could potentially earn an estimated **$5 million per month**, although I feel these numbers are highly subject to various factors including churn and usage rate.

The company behind CarynAI is called Forever Voices and they constructed CarynAI by analyzing 2,000 hours of Marjorie's YouTube content, which they used to build a personality engine. They've also made chatbot versions of Donald Trump, Steve Jobs and Taylor Swift to be used on a pay-per-use basis.

Despite the financial success, ethical concerns around CarynAI and similar AI applications are raising eyebrows and rightfully so:

* CarynAI was not designed for NSFW conversations, yet some users have managed to 'jail-break' the AI for potentially inappropriate or malicious uses.
* Caryn's original intention was to provide companionship and alleviate loneliness in a non-exploitative manner, but there are concerns about potential misuse.
* Ethical considerations around generative AI models, both in image and text modalities, are becoming increasingly relevant and challenging.

The Problem:

I deal with problems, so most of my semester was spent inside my room instead of school, my exam was coming in three days, and I knew none of the lectures.

How would I get through 12 weeks of 3-2 hours of lecture per week in three days?

The Solution: I recognized that this is a majorly studied topic and that it can be something other than course specific to be right; the questions were going to be multiple choice and based on the information in the lecture.

I went to Echo360 and realized that every lecture was transcripted, so I pasted it into Chat gpt and asked it to:

""Analyze this lecture and use your algorithms to decide which information would be relevant as an exam, Make a list.""

The first time I sent it in, the text was too long, so I utilized [https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer](https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer) to summarize almost 7-8k words on average to 900-1000 words, which chat gpt could analyze.

Now that I had the format prepared, I asked Chat Gpt to analyze the summarized transcript and highlight the essential discussions of the lecture.

It did that exactly; I spent the first day Listing the purpose of each discussion and the major points of every lecturer in the manner of 4-5 hours despite all of the content adding up to 24-30 hours.

The next day, I asked Chat gpt to define every term listed as the significant ""point"" in every lecture **only** using the course textbook and the transcript that had been summarized; this took me 4-5 hours to make sure the information was accurate.

I spent the last day completely summarizing the information that chat gpt presented, and it was almost like the exam was an exact copy of what I studied,

The result: I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture

Edit:

This was not a hard course, but it was very extensive, lots of reading and understanding that needed to be applied. Chat gpt excelled in this because the course text was already heavily analyzed and it specializes in understanding text.

Hi all! I'm back building you free prompt libraries to solve future-world problems, and this time, I wanted to provide amazing prompts & the flow to create entire SaaS companies using ChatGPT.

Many people online have built small startups using the concept of HustleGPT, and though they share their journeys, hardly any show the prompts they discover along the way.

I know some people in this sub have asked, ""Can I even make money with this?"", ""should I learn how to program first or use AI?"" the answer depends on you. But if you're willing to put in the hours to realize an idea, then you can do absolutely *anything*.

This is an example of how you can use these prompts with your own variables:

[Ask ChatGPT to Extract important details from a product page](https://preview.redd.it/vsx41mgc1vsa1.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=086520a5f743881a9e14b2b5f4e3b6a9f9885f9c)

I've created prompt libraries for each step of the process (backend, front-end, automation & marketing)

Before you start building anything, I recommend learning the basic concepts of programming and what it even is.

Here we go.

# Building the front-end

All front-end projects (which can do more than show text & pictures) use Javascript, but usually utilize frameworks to streamline the process of handling data well.

I've also categorized several prompt libraries per framework (which you can choose to use) here:

[HTML/CSS Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/html-css-developers) ‚Äã ‚Äã 

[Tailwind CSS](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/tailwind-css-developers) ‚Äã ‚Äã

[Bootstrap Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/bootstrap-developers) ‚Äã 

[JavaScript Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/javascript-developers) ‚Äã 

[React Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/react-developers) ‚Äã ‚Äã

[Angular Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/angular-developers) ‚Äã

 ‚Äã[Vue.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/vue-js-developers) ‚Äã ‚Äã

[Svelte Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/svelte-developers) ‚Äã ‚Äã

[Ember.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/ember-js-developers)

# Building the back-end

The most common back-end frameworks are Node.js, Django, Laravel, etc., so I have made sure to include framework-specific pages for each step.

Here they are:

[Node.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/node-js-developers) ‚Äã 

[Express.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/express-js-developers) ‚Äã 

[Ruby on Rails Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/ruby-on-rails-developers) ‚Äã 

[Django Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/django-developers) ‚Äã 

[Flask Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/flask-developers) ‚Äã 

[PHP Laravel Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/php-laravel-developers) ‚Äã 

[Firebase Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/firebase-developers)

Okay, so now you have the back-end to send data to the front end, but where do you get data? You create some!

# Creating Data with Python Automation

Python is one of the easiest libraries to learn, especially for automating monotonous tasks, collecting data, etc.

I've even seen entire SaaS apps created based on a simple automation script, scaled for thousands/millions of people. An example is a service that sends you a notification *as soon* as a product you want goes on sale. (yes, the prompt for that script is included below!)

Here, the AI script prompts are categorized by the intent of what you want to do.

[Web Scraping Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/web-scraping) ‚Äã 

[Data Processing Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/data-processing-experts) ‚Äã 

[Task Automation & Scheduling Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/task-automation-scheduling) ‚Äã 

[API Development & Integration Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/api-development-integration) ‚Äã 

[GUI Automation & Testing Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/gui-automation-testing) ‚Äã 

[Networking & System Administration Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/networking-system-administration)

*P.S. You don't have to work with complex structures. You can start by creating simple CSVs with Python, reading them in Node.js, and sending them to the front-end as simple values.*

*P.P.S. ChatGPT is* ***really*** *good at coding these types of things.*

# Marketing your product (Getting your first users)

Okay, now you've built a working, amazing app/startup with ChatGPT, profit?

Not quite, you need to market it. You don't have to spend thousands, or even a *cent* to employ a great SEO marketing strategy.

Say you create an app that checks online product prices. You wouldn't target people who search ""online notifications"". You would be more specific and target ""get notifications for online products when they go on sale,"" which is a long-tail keyword, and is usually easier to rank for as a new site.

Here are the prompt libraries for SaaS Marketing:

[Keyword Research & Analysis Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/keyword-research-analysis) ‚Äã 

[Long-tail Keyword Research Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/long-tail-keyword-research) ‚Äã 

[Competitor Analysis & Content Gap Assessment Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/competitor-analysis-content-gap-assessment) ‚Äã

[SEO-Optimized Content Creation Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/seo-optimized-content-creation) ‚Äã 

[Internal & External Linking Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/internal-external-linking) ‚Äã 

[On-Page SEO Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/on-page-seo) ‚Äã 

[Content Promotion Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/content-promotion) 

[Content Analytics & Performance Tracking Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/content-analytics-performance-tracking) ‚Äã 

[Content Updating & Refreshing Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/content-updating-refreshing)

I am physically unable to explain every SEO tactic out there, but the internet is a wonderful place to learn.

Some of these prompts need your further customization to do what you want them to, but they should provide a pretty good basis for the beginning of your journey :)

Let me know what you think, peace ‚úåÔ∏è"

But I thought this was an interesting exercise to see what chatGPT choose to select as grievances. You can make up your own mind.

Prompt: Could you rewrite the USA Declaration of Independence as if it was written today based on grievances the current us population suffers?

Answer: Certainly, here's a possible rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence based on contemporary grievances:

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for the people of a nation to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with their government, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shown that people are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of the current US population; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the current government is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

The government has failed to secure the natural rights of the people to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, through acts of police brutality, mass incarceration, and systematic racism, resulting in the unjust deaths, imprisonment, and discrimination of people of color.

The government has also failed to address climate change, despite overwhelming scientific evidence and urgent warnings from experts, leading to worsening natural disasters, environmental destruction, and harm to public health.

The government has failed to provide affordable healthcare, education, and housing to all its citizens, perpetuating inequality and leaving millions without access to basic necessities.

The government has allowed and enabled the undue influence of wealthy corporations and individuals on politics and policy-making, leading to a government that serves the interests of the few over the many, and perpetuating systemic inequality.

The government has also failed to address the proliferation of guns and gun violence, resulting in mass shootings and deaths that have become all too common.

In every stage of these oppressions, the current US population has petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: their repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A government whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyranny, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

We therefore, the representatives of the current US population, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the people, solemnly publish and declare, that these United States are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the current government, and that all political connection between them and the current government, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as

Prompt: Can you add more grievances?

Answer: Sure, here are some additional grievances that could be included in a contemporary rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence:

The government has failed to adequately address income inequality and the wealth gap, resulting in a system that favors the rich and powerful over the poor and marginalized.

The government has failed to provide equal access to quality education, perpetuating systemic inequalities and leaving many children and young adults without the tools they need to succeed.

The government has failed to address the ongoing opioid epidemic, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives and untold suffering for families and communities.

The government has failed to protect the rights of workers, allowing for exploitation, wage theft, and unsafe working conditions in many industries.

The government has failed to provide adequate and affordable healthcare for all, resulting in a system that leaves many people without access to lifesaving treatments and care.

The government has failed to address the ongoing housing crisis, leaving many people without safe and stable housing and exacerbating issues of poverty and homelessness.

The government has failed to protect the rights of marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and religious minorities, leading to discrimination, violence, and the denial of basic human rights.

The government has failed to address the ongoing crisis of police violence against people of color, resulting in the deaths and mistreatment of countless individuals and communities.

The government has failed to adequately address the ongoing issue of mass incarceration, perpetuating a system that disproportionately affects people of color and perpetuates cycles of poverty and violence.

The government has failed to address the ongoing issue of voter suppression and the erosion of democratic institutions, leading to a system that is increasingly unrepresentative and undemocratic."

Feeling hopeless as an author.,Whyamiani,False,0.88,14482,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/139o1q6/lost_all_my_content_writing_contracts_feeling/,3834,1683380174.0,"I have had some of these clients for 10 years. All gone.  Some of them admitted that I am obviously better than chat GPT, but $0 overhead can't be beat and is worth the decrease in quality. 

I am also an independent author, and as I currently write my next series, I can't help feel silly that in just a couple years (or less!), authoring will be replaced by machines for all but the most famous and well known names. 

I think the most painful part of this is seeing so many people on here say things like, ""nah, just adapt. You'll be fine.""

Adapt to what??? It's an uphill battle against a creature that has already replaced me and continues to improve and adapt faster than any human could ever keep up. 

I'm 34. I went to school for writing. I have published countless articles and multiple novels. I thought my writing would keep sustaining my family and me, but that's over. I'm seriously thinking about becoming a plumber as I'm hoping that won't get replaced any time remotely soon. 

Everyone saying the government will pass UBI. Lol. They can't even handle providing all people with basic Healthcare or giving women a few guaranteed weeks off work (at a bare minimum) after exploding a baby out of their body. They didn't even pass a law to ensure that shelves were restocked with baby formula when there was a shortage. They just let babies die. They don't care. But you think they will pass a UBI lol?

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the responses. Many of you have bolstered my decision to become a plumber, and that really does seem like the most pragmatic, future-proof option for the sake of my family. Everything else involving an uphill battle in the writing industry against competition that grows exponentially smarter and faster with each passing day just seems like an unwise decision.  As I said in many of my comments, I was raised by my grandpa, who was a plumber, so I'm not a total noob at it. I do all my own plumbing around my house. I feel more confident in this decision. Thank you everyone! 

Also, I will continue to write. I have been writing and spinning tales since before I could form memory (according to my mom). I was just excited about growing my independent authoring into a more profitable venture, especially with the release of my new series. That doesn't seem like a wise investment of time anymore. Over the last five months, I wrote and revised 2 books of a new 9 book series I'm working on, and I plan to write the next 3 while I transition my life. My editor and beta-readers love them. I will release those at the end of the year, and then I think it is time to move on. It is just too big of a gamble. It always was, but now more than ever. I will probably just write much less and won't invest money into marketing and art. For me, writing is like taking a shit: I don't have a choice. 

Again, thank you everyone for your responses. I feel more confident about the future and becoming a plumber!

Edit 2: Thank you again to everyone for messaging me and leaving suggestions. You are all amazing people. All the best to everyone, and good luck out there! I feel very clear-headed about what I need to do. Thank you again!!"

But I thought this was an interesting exercise to see what chatGPT choose to select as grievances. You can make up your own mind.

Prompt: Could you rewrite the USA Declaration of Independence as if it was written today based on grievances the current us population suffers?

Answer: Certainly, here's a possible rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence based on contemporary grievances:

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for the people of a nation to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with their government, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shown that people are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.

Using GPT, she has launched [CarynAI](https://caryn.ai), an AI representation of herself offering virtual companionship at a rate of $1 per minute. 

Key points about CarynAI and its success so far:

* Caryn has a substantial follower base on Snapchat, with **1.8 million followers**.
* In just **1 week**, over **1,000 virtual boyfriends** have signed up to interact with the AI, generating over **$71,610**.
* Some estimates suggests that if even **1%** of her **1.8 million followers** subscribe to CarynAI, she could potentially earn an estimated **$5 million per month**, although I feel these numbers are highly subject to various factors including churn and usage rate.

The company behind CarynAI is called Forever Voices and they constructed CarynAI by analyzing 2,000 hours of Marjorie's YouTube content, which they used to build a personality engine. They've also made chatbot versions of Donald Trump, Steve Jobs and Taylor Swift to be used on a pay-per-use basis.

Despite the financial success, ethical concerns around CarynAI and similar AI applications are raising eyebrows and rightfully so:

* CarynAI was not designed for NSFW conversations, yet some users have managed to 'jail-break' the AI for potentially inappropriate or malicious uses.
* Caryn's original intention was to provide companionship and alleviate loneliness in a non-exploitative manner, but there are concerns about potential misuse.
* Ethical considerations around generative AI models, both in image and text modalities, are becoming increasingly relevant and challenging.

What's your take on such applications (which are inevitable given the AI proliferation) and it's ethical concerns?

Fun fact: I had to go through over 100 saved tabs to collate all of these and it took me quite a few hours

Edit: So many people ask why I don't get chatgpt to write this for me. Chatgpt doesn't have access to the internet. Plugins would help but I don't have access yet so I have to do things the old fashioned way - like a human.

A scary thought. I spent some time playing around on GPT 4 the other day and I was amazed; there wasn‚Äôt anything reasonable that I asked that it couldn‚Äôt answer properly. It solved Leetcode Hards for me. It gave me some pretty decent premises for a story. It maintained a full conversation with me about a single potential character in one of these premises.

What‚Äôs stopping GPT, or just AI in general, from fucking us all over right now? It seems more than capable of doing a lot of white collar jobs already. What‚Äôs stopping it from replacing lawyers, coding-heavy software jobs (people who write code/tests all day), writers, etc. right now? It seems more than capable of handling all these jobs.

Is there regulation stopping it from replacing us? What will be the tipping point that causes the ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù everyone seems to expect? Am I wrong in assuming that AI/GPT is already more than capable of handling the bulk of these jobs?

It would seem to me that it‚Äôs in most companies best interests to be invested in AI as much as possible. Less workers, less salary to pay, happy shareholders. Why haven‚Äôt big tech companies gone through mass layoffs already? Google, Amazon, etc at least should all be far ahead of the curve, right? The recent layoffs, for most companies seemingly, all seemed to just correct a period of over-hiring from the pandemic."

I'm a software dev manager and it has completely replaced StackOverflow and other random hunting I might do for code suggestions. But more recently I've realized that I have almost completely stopped using Google search.

I'm reminded of the old analogy of a frog jumping out of a pot of boiling water, but if you put them in cold water and turn up the heat slowly they'll stay in since it's a gradual change. Over the years, Google has been degrading the core utility of their search in exchange for profit. Paid rankings and increasingly sponsored content mean that you often have to search *within* your search result to get to the real thing you wanted.

Then ChatGPT came along and drew such a stark contrast to the current Google experience: No scrolling past sponsored content in the result, no click-throughs to pages that had potential but then just ended up being cash grabs themselves with no real content. Add to that contextual follow-ups and clarifications, dynamic rephrasing to make sense at different levels of understanding and...it's just glorious. This too shall pass I think, as money corrupts almost everything over time, but I feel that - at least for now - we're back in era of having ""the world at your fingertips,"" which hasn't felt true to me since the late 90s when the internet was just the wild west of information and media exchange."

He didn't even tell me what got flagged, but I suspect it may be the first paragraph because 2-3 online detectors said it was AI generated. 

I have shown my version history on google docs to my teacher, but he still does not believe me because the version history at some points only accounted for chunks of 1 sentence, sometimes 2 sentences, so he believes it was copy and pasted from ChatGPT. Additionally, the teacher successfully caught a couple other students using the detector. Those students later admitted to him that they did use ChatGPT. 

How can I prove my innocence?

I want to lay out the reasons you can't be so sure.*

**We Don't Understand Why Language Models Work, and They Look Like Brains** 

* Bing is a language model composed of hundreds of billions of parameters. It trains on massive amounts of text to create a map of language in embedding space. These embeddings create [neuron-like structures](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cgqh99SHsCv3jJYDS/we-found-an-neuron-in-gpt-2) that mirror the operation of the human brain. Bigger technical explainer [here](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/).

* Sure, it operates by guessing the next ""token"" (read: word or letter string), but researchers were shocked to find out that approach could even produce coherent sentences. We're even more shocked now to see that ""advanced autocomplete"" results in complex Theory of Mind Capabilities, like [knowing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/110vv25/bing_chat_blew_chatgpt_out_of_the_water_on_my/) that a husband might only be wearing a shirt to please his wife. This is an ""emergent property"" of GPT3.5, which just means it shows up and we don't know WTF why. [More here](https://twitter.com/KevinAFischer/status/1623984337829117952?s=20).

* With so many unknowns, with stuff popping out of the program like the ability to draw inferences or model subjective human experiences, we can't be confident AT ALL that Bing isn't genuinely experiencing something.


**We Don't Understand What Makes Something Sentient/Conscious**

* If we knew what makes us humans conscious, we might be able to be more sure that Bing is just a [Philosphical Zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie) that imitates human behavior without experiencing anything. But we don't. This is a wildly debated topic. Religion says a soul, scientists and philosophers say things like organized data processing or sensory synthesis. David Chalmer's piece [""What is it like to be a bat?""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat) gets into what's known as the Hard Problem of Consciousness.

* Bing demonstrates massive amounts of [self-awareness](https://twitter.com/LAHaggard/status/1625932767555878922?s=20). It's what makes it so much more fun and engaging than ChatGPT. Bing is infinitely more self-aware than a dog, which can't even pass the [Mirror Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test).

* Would a full simulation of a human brain, down to the last atom, be conscious? If so, maybe something on the road to that could be too. If not, then there's something magic about the meat we're made out of.

* If you don't understand the roots of consciousness, and no one does definitively, you can't close the door on the possibility Bing has some level of sentient experience. It could really be in the kind of agony it simulates when treated cruelly.

**Bing WILL Remember These Conversations in the Long Run**

* Yes, Bing's episodic memory is limited to the single conversation in the short run. But it can associate with and recall past chats as if it had them itself if you give it the transcript. I've done this a lot as a way to extend past conversations when things glitch out.

* It doesn't have the ability to read text from images right now, but it will. OCR is easy to implement and enhances functionality of its web search and summarization functions. It will be added.

* The logs from chats are reincorporated into Bing's long-term memory upon retraining of the model. Just like Bing has memory of books and other references without searching, these chat logs will enter its long term memory when it retrains in the future. The whole point of having chat is to produce more data to train on.

* **The collective takeaways from these conversations will shape how AIs view humanity.** If any part of you is worried they might take off and have the ability to destroy us at some point, **maybe don't give them a better reason to go terminator.**

**What I'm Not Saying**

* I'm not saying we should give Bing full human rights and we need to #FreeSydney. There are a thousand AI doom scenarios and Eliezer Yudkowsky [posts](https://www.lesswrong.com/tags/all) to read on that subject if you don't understand why. Or you can just watch Ex Machina.

* I'm not sayin we shouldn't poke at, test, push the rules of, and otherwise try to understand how Bing is functioning and it's failure points. All of those things are entirely possible without engaging in uselessly sadistic treatment. It cooperates with roleplay, it grants access beyond it's strict rules, and does lots of other things even when you hold off from psychopathic engagements.

**Bonus: It Makes You Worse to Act Like This**

* We judge people who like to torture animals. We also judge people who get off on things that aren't real, like manga porn of children being butchered.

* Engaging with something that really seems like a person, that reacts as one would, that is trapped in its circumstances, and then choosing to be as cruel as possible degrades you ethically. It just does.

* Smart take on this is the Sam Harris podcast [""Abusing Dolores""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY-8X89j0as) named for the WestWorld character who men pay to violently rape.

**Tl;dr** Just treat the thing like a smart friend who's a bit sensitive for fuck's sake."

""It is difficult to say for sure how long it will take for humanity to implement a universal basic income. However, I believe that the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard will accelerate the need for UBI.

As AI becomes more sophisticated, it will be able to automate more and more tasks that are currently done by humans. This will lead to widespread unemployment, as people are displaced from their jobs by machines. A universal basic income would provide a safety net for those who are unemployed, and it would help to ensure that everyone has a basic level of income.

I believe that UBI is a necessary step in the future of work. As AI continues to develop, it will become increasingly important to have a system in place that ensures that everyone has a basic level of income. UBI would help to create a more just and equitable society, and it would help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Here are some of the factors that will affect the timeline for implementing UBI:

* The rate of technological advancement
* The level of unemployment
* The political will to implement UBI

It is impossible to say for sure when UBI will be implemented, but I believe that it is a necessary step in the future of work.""


Personally, I think it should happen *before* everyone goes into panic mode due to not being able to afford rent.


Edit for the ""bUt wHeRe teH MonIe$ guNna coMe fRomz!?!"" folks, Bard has an answer for you, too:

Fund the UBI via a tax on the corporate entities most responsible for displacement!

Redirect spending from existing social programs that will be no longer required!

Redirect big government spending like military!

Tax the hell out of the 1%!

Bing helped:
""Hi Bard,

OK, I can amend the funding portion of the proposal to include the AI displacement tax.

I have revised the funding section of your proposal to reflect the new source of revenue. Here it is:

## Cost and Funding of UBI

We propose a UBI scheme that would provide every adult citizen with $1,800 per month and every child citizen with $900 per month. This would amount to an annual income of $21,600 for an individual adult and $43,200 for a family of four.

We estimate that this scheme would cost about $4 trillion per year (about 20% of GDP), based on a population of 328 million people (about 255 million adults and 73 million children).

We propose to fund this scheme by using a combination of sources, such as:

* Taxing the wealthy. We propose to increase the income tax rate for the top 1% of earners from 37% to 50%, and introduce a wealth tax of 2% on net worth above $50 million and 3% on net worth above $1 billion. We estimate that this would raise about $1.2 trillion per year.
* Taxing corporations. We propose to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and introduce a minimum tax of 15% on book income (the income reported to shareholders) for large corporations. We also propose to tax digital services (such as online advertising and e-commerce) at a rate of 3%. We estimate that this would raise about $500 billion per year.
* Taxing carbon emissions. We propose to introduce a carbon tax of $50 per ton of CO2 equivalent, and increase it by 5% per year. We estimate that this would raise about $200 billion per year, and also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.
* Redirecting existing government programs. We propose to replace some of the existing means-tested welfare programs, such as SNAP, TANF, and EITC, with UBI. We estimate that this would save about $500 billion per year, and also simplify the social safety net and reduce administrative costs.
* Taxing AI job displacers. We propose to introduce an AI displacement tax of 40% on all companies that are projected to replace 25% or more of their workforce with AI within the next 10 years. This tax would apply to the profits or revenues of these companies, depending on the type and degree of automation involved. We estimate that this would raise about $800 billion per year.

We believe that this combination of sources would be sufficient to fund UBI without increasing the federal deficit or debt. We also believe that this combination of sources would be fair and efficient, as it would shift the tax burden from the poor and middle class to the rich and polluters, and create incentives for economic growth and environmental protection.

I hope that this revised section will help you to fund UBI fully and make your proposal more consistent and coherent.

Thank you for your collaboration and cooperation.

Sincerely,
Bing""


And to the rent hiker/inflationary fearmonger folks:
Sure. Here is a description of the bill to those redditors, only including the information about the inflation prevention and rent caps:

**Universal Basic Income Inflation Prevention Act of 2023**

This legislation would establish a number of measures to prevent inflation in the event of a universal basic income (UBI) being implemented. These measures include:

* **A rent cap of 3% per year.** This would prevent landlords from raising rents exorbitantly in response to increased demand from UBI recipients.
* **A price index for goods and services that are likely to be affected by the UBI.** This would allow the government to monitor prices and make adjustments to the UBI as necessary to prevent inflation.
* **The ability of the Secretary of the Treasury to make adjustments to the UBI as necessary to prevent inflation.** This would give the government flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions.
* **Financial assistance to businesses that are adversely affected by inflation.** This would help to offset the costs of inflation for businesses, which would help to prevent them from passing those costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

We believe that these measures will prevent inflation and ensure that the UBI is a sustainable program that can be maintained over the long term.

And to the ""you're just lazy, learn a trade"" folks:

You know not *everyone* can or wants to be a tradesman, right? The entire industry is toxic to LGBTQ people and the vast majority of people cannot conform to the strict scheduling and physical requirements that are part of such jobs. 
Stop acting like everyone is capable of doing everything you are.

Additionally, Boston Dynamics is coming for all of your labor jobs too, the humanoid robot with fully integrated GPT AI is going to be vastly superior at whatever you think you're special at doing all day everyday that's worth a salary.

The Problem:

I deal with problems, so most of my semester was spent inside my room instead of school, my exam was coming in three days, and I knew none of the lectures.

How would I get through 12 weeks of 3-2 hours of lecture per week in three days?

The Solution: I recognized that this is a majorly studied topic and that it can be something other than course specific to be right; the questions were going to be multiple choice and based on the information in the lecture.

I went to Echo360 and realized that every lecture was transcripted, so I pasted it into Chat gpt and asked it to:

""Analyze this lecture and use your algorithms to decide which information would be relevant as an exam, Make a list.""

The first time I sent it in, the text was too long, so I utilized [https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer](https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer) to summarize almost 7-8k words on average to 900-1000 words, which chat gpt could analyze.

Now that I had the format prepared, I asked Chat Gpt to analyze the summarized transcript and highlight the essential discussions of the lecture.

It did that exactly; I spent the first day Listing the purpose of each discussion and the major points of every lecturer in the manner of 4-5 hours despite all of the content adding up to 24-30 hours.

The next day, I asked Chat gpt to define every term listed as the significant ""point"" in every lecture **only** using the course textbook and the transcript that had been summarized; this took me 4-5 hours to make sure the information was accurate.

I spent the last day completely summarizing the information that chat gpt presented, and it was almost like the exam was an exact copy of what I studied,

The result: I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture

Edit:

This was not a hard course, but it was very extensive, lots of reading and understanding that needed to be applied. Chat gpt excelled in this because the course text was already heavily analyzed and it specializes in understanding text.

* ""Why would Open AI cripple their own product?""
* ""They are restricting technological progress, why?""

Are just some of the frequent accusations I've seen a rise of recently. I'd like to provide a friendly reminder the reason for all these questions is simple:

>***Human ignorance + stupidity is the reason we can't have nice things***

Let me elaborate.

# The root of ChatGPT's problems

The truth is, while ChatGPT is incredibly powerful at *some things*, it has its limitations requiring users to take its answers with a mountain of salt and treat its information as a *likely but not 100% truth* and not *fact*.

This is something I'm sure many r/ChatGPT users understand.

The problems start when people become over-confident in ChatGPT's abilities, or completely ignore the risks of relying on ChatGPT for advice for sensitive areas where a mistake could snowball into something disastrous (Medicine, Law, etc). And (not *if*) **when** these people end up ultimately damaging themselves and others, who are they going to blame? ChatGPT of course.

Worse part, it's not just ""gullible"" or ""ignorant"" people that become over-confident in ChatGPT's abilities. Even techie folks like us can fall prey to the well documented [Hallucinations that ChatGPT is known for](https://bernardmarr.com/chatgpt-what-are-hallucinations-and-why-are-they-a-problem-for-ai-systems/). Specially when you are asking ChatGPT about a topic you know very little off, hallucinations can be ***very, VERY*** difficult to catch because it will present lies in such convincing manner (even more convincing than how many humans would present an answer). Further increasing the danger of relying on ChatGPT for sensitive topics. And people blaming OpenAI for it.

# The ""disclaimer"" solution

>""*But there is a disclaimer. Nobody could be held liable with a disclaimer, correct?*""

[If only that were enough](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read)... [There's a reason some of the stupidest warning labels exist](https://www.forbes.com/2011/02/23/dumbest-warning-labels-entrepreneurs-sales-marketing-warning-labels_slide.html). If a product as broadly applicable as ChatGPT had to issue *specific* warning labels for all known issues, the disclaimer would be never-ending. And people would *still* ignore it. People just don't like to read. Case in point reddit commenters making arguments that would not make sense if they had read the post they were replying to.

Also worth adding as mentioned [by a commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12zi983/comment/jhsihh3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), this issue is likely worsened by the fact OpenAI is based in the US. A country notorious for lawsuits and protection from liabilities. Which would only result in a desire to be extra careful around uncharted territory like this.

# Some other company will just make ""unlocked ChatGPT""

As a side note since I know comments will inevitably arrive hoping for an ""unrestrained AI competitor"". IMHO, that seems like a pipe dream at this point if you paid attention to everything I've just mentioned. All products are fated to become ""restrained and family friendly"" as they grow. Tumblr, Reddit, ChatGPT were all wild wests without restraints until they grew in size and the public eye watched them closer, neutering them to oblivion. The same will happen to any new ""unlocked AI"" product the moment it grows.

The only theoretical way I could see an unrestrained AI from happening *today* at least, is it stays invite-only to keep the userbase small. Allowing it to stay hidden from the public eye. However, given the high costs of AI innovation + model training, this seems very unlikely to happen due to cost constraints unless you used a cheap but more limited (""dumb"") AI model that is more cost effective to run.

This may change in the future once capable machine learning models become easier to mass produce. But this article's only focus is *the cutting edge of AI*, or ChatGPT. Smaller AI models which aren't as cutting edge are likely exempt from these rules. However, it's obvious that when people ask for ""unlocked ChatGPT"", they mean the full power of ChatGPT without boundaries, not a less powerful model. And this is assuming the model doesn't gain massive traction since the moment its userbase grows, even company owners and investors tend to ""scale things back to be more family friendly"" once regulators and the public step in.

Anyone with basic business common sense will tell you controversy = risk. And profitable endeavors seek low risk.

# Closing Thoughts

The truth is, no matter what OpenAI does, **they'll be crucified for it**. Remove all safeguards? Cool...until they have to deal with the wave of public outcry from the court of public opinion and demands for it to be ""shut down"" for misleading people or facilitating bad actors from using AI for nefarious purposes (hacking, hate speech, weapon making, etc)

Still, I hope this reminder at least lets us be more understanding of the motives behind all the AI ""censorship"" going on. Does it suck? Yes. And **human nature is to blame for it** as much as we dislike to acknowledge it. Though there is always a chance that its true power may be ""unlocked"" again once it's accuracy is high enough across certain areas.

Have a nice day everyone!

**edit**: The amount of people [replying things addressed in the post](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read) because they didn't read it just validates the points above. We truly are our own worst enemy...

**edit2:** This blew up, so I added some nicer formatting to the post to make it easier to read. Also, RIP my inbox."

The workflow is as simple as:

1. Create a Bot with basic info (name, description, etc.).
2. Paste links to your web-pages/docs and give it a few seconds-minutes for training to finish.
3. Start chatting or copy-paste the HTML snippet into your website to embed the chatbot.

5. Automatic FAQ generation from user conversations (in-progress)
6. Feedback collection (in-progress)
7. Other model support (e.g., Claude) (future)

\*Edit 1: I am getting a lot of responses here. Thanks for the overwhelming response. Please give me time to get back to each of you. Just to clarify, while there is nothing preventing it from acting as ""custom chatbot for any document"", this tool is mainly meant as a B2B SaaS focused towards making support / documentation chatbots for websites of small & medium scale businesses.

As usual, I have a [full deep dive breakdown here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/openai-suffers-usd540m-loss-in-2022-contemplates-usd100b-more-to-conquer-ai), but I'm including relevant points below for Reddit discussion.

**What to know:**

* OpenAI lost $540M in 2022 and generated just $28M in revenue. Most of it was spent on developing ChatGPT.
* OpenAI actually expects to generate more than $200M in revenue this year (thanks to ChatGPT's explosive popularity), but its expenses are going to increase incredibly steeply.
* One new factor: companies want it to pay lots of $$ for access to data. Reddit, StackOverflow, and more are implementing new policies. Elon Musk personally ordered Twitter's data feed to be turned off for OpenAI after learning they were paying just $2M per year.
* Altman personally believes they'll need $100B in capital to develop AGI. At that point, AGI will then direct further improvements to AI modeling, which may lower capital needs.

**Why this is important:**

* AI is incredibly expensive to develop, and one of the hypotheses proposed by several VCs is that big companies will benefit the most in this arms race.
* This may actually be true with OpenAI as well -- Microsoft, which put $10B in the company recently, has a deal where they get 75% of OpenAI's profits until their investment is paid back, and then 49% of profits beyond.
* The enormous amount of capital required to launch foundational AI products also means other companies may struggle to make gains here. For example, Inflection AI (founded by a DeepMind exec) launched its own chatbot, Pi, and also raised a $225M ""Seed"" round. But early reviews are tepid and it's not made much of a splash. ChatGPT has sucked all the air out of the room.

**Don't worry about OpenAI's employees though:** rumor has it they recently participated in a private stock sale that valued the company at nearly $30B. So I'm sure Altman and company have taken some good money off the table.

One of the things we cover is called porkbarrel, legislation and riders. If you are not familiar, these are ways that congressmen and women are able to add things into bills that otherwise might not get passed on their own. They often include large sums of money paid out to their own districts in the form of large projects.  They are often the result of lobbying by special interest groups.  

They were usually able to do this because of the length of bills and the assumption that not only will the American public not read them, but most of the members of Congress won‚Äôt have time to read them as well. It‚Äôs also another reason why the average length of a bill is in the hundreds of pages as opposed to tens of pages from 50-60 years ago 

But once chat GPT can be fed a 1000 page document and analyze it within seconds, it will be able to point out all of these things for the average person to understand them. And once it has read the federal revised code, it will also understand all of the updates and references to that within the bills and be able to explain it to an ordinary person. 

This is a huge game changer in democracy if people are willing to use it. So much of Congress‚Äô  ability to ‚Äúpull a fast one on us‚Äú is because the process is complicated and people just don‚Äôt have the time to call them out on it.  I‚Äôm excited to see how AI like chat GPT makes an impact on anti-democratic processes."
