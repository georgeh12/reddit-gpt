0,139o1q6,chatgpt,GPT-3,top,2023-05-06 13:36:14,Lost all my content writing contracts. Feeling hopeless as an author.,Whyamiani,False,0.88,14480,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/139o1q6/lost_all_my_content_writing_contracts_feeling/,3834,1683380174.0,"I have had some of these clients for 10 years. All gone.  Some of them admitted that I am obviously better than chat GPT, but $0 overhead can't be beat and is worth the decrease in quality. 

I am also an independent author, and as I currently write my next series, I can't help feel silly that in just a couple years (or less!), authoring will be replaced by machines for all but the most famous and well known names. 

I think the most painful part of this is seeing so many people on here say things like, ""nah, just adapt. You'll be fine.""

Adapt to what??? It's an uphill battle against a creature that has already replaced me and continues to improve and adapt faster than any human could ever keep up. 

I'm 34. I went to school for writing. I have published countless articles and multiple novels. I thought my writing would keep sustaining my family and me, but that's over. I'm seriously thinking about becoming a plumber as I'm hoping that won't get replaced any time remotely soon. 

Everyone saying the government will pass UBI. Lol. They can't even handle providing all people with basic Healthcare or giving women a few guaranteed weeks off work (at a bare minimum) after exploding a baby out of their body. They didn't even pass a law to ensure that shelves were restocked with baby formula when there was a shortage. They just let babies die. They don't care. But you think they will pass a UBI lol?

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the responses. Many of you have bolstered my decision to become a plumber, and that really does seem like the most pragmatic, future-proof option for the sake of my family. Everything else involving an uphill battle in the writing industry against competition that grows exponentially smarter and faster with each passing day just seems like an unwise decision.  As I said in many of my comments, I was raised by my grandpa, who was a plumber, so I'm not a total noob at it. I do all my own plumbing around my house. I feel more confident in this decision. Thank you everyone! 

Also, I will continue to write. I have been writing and spinning tales since before I could form memory (according to my mom). I was just excited about growing my independent authoring into a more profitable venture, especially with the release of my new series. That doesn't seem like a wise investment of time anymore. Over the last five months, I wrote and revised 2 books of a new 9 book series I'm working on, and I plan to write the next 3 while I transition my life. My editor and beta-readers love them. I will release those at the end of the year, and then I think it is time to move on. It is just too big of a gamble. It always was, but now more than ever. I will probably just write much less and won't invest money into marketing and art. For me, writing is like taking a shit: I don't have a choice. 

Again, thank you everyone for your responses. I feel more confident about the future and becoming a plumber!

Edit 2: Thank you again to everyone for messaging me and leaving suggestions. You are all amazing people. All the best to everyone, and good luck out there! I feel very clear-headed about what I need to do. Thank you again!!"

Edit: For those wondering why its paid - I hate ads and don't want to rely on running ads in my newsletter. I'd rather try and get paid to do all this work like this than force my readers to read sponsorship bs in the middle of a newsletter. Call me old fashioned but I just hate ads with a passion

Edit 2: If you'd like to tip you can tip here [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil). Absolutely no pressure to do so, appreciate all the comments and support üôè

Fun fact: I had to go through over 100 saved tabs to collate all of these and it took me quite a few hours

Edit: So many people ask why I don't get chatgpt to write this for me. Chatgpt doesn't have access to the internet. Plugins would help but I don't have access yet so I have to do things the old fashioned way - like a human.

2,12q2b0e,chatgpt,GPT-3,top,2023-04-17 23:54:54,Chatgpt Helped me pass an exam with 94% despite never attending or watching a class.,151N,False,0.9,9312,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12q2b0e/chatgpt_helped_me_pass_an_exam_with_94_despite/,954,1681775694.0,"Hello, This is just my review and innovation on utilizing Ai to assist with education

The Problem:

I deal with problems, so most of my semester was spent inside my room instead of school, my exam was coming in three days, and I knew none of the lectures.

How would I get through 12 weeks of 3-2 hours of lecture per week in three days?

The Solution: I recognized that this is a majorly studied topic and that it can be something other than course specific to be right; the questions were going to be multiple choice and based on the information in the lecture.

I went to Echo360 and realized that every lecture was transcripted, so I pasted it into Chat gpt and asked it to:

""Analyze this lecture and use your algorithms to decide which information would be relevant as an exam, Make a list.""

The first time I sent it in, the text was too long, so I utilized [https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer](https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer) to summarize almost 7-8k words on average to 900-1000 words, which chat gpt could analyze.

Now that I had the format prepared, I asked Chat Gpt to analyze the summarized transcript and highlight the essential discussions of the lecture.

It did that exactly; I spent the first day Listing the purpose of each discussion and the major points of every lecturer in the manner of 4-5 hours despite all of the content adding up to 24-30 hours.

The next day, I asked Chat gpt to define every term listed as the significant ""point"" in every lecture **only** using the course textbook and the transcript that had been summarized; this took me 4-5 hours to make sure the information was accurate.

I spent the last day completely summarizing the information that chat gpt presented, and it was almost like the exam was an exact copy of what I studied,

The result: I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture

Edit:

This was not a hard course, but it was very extensive, lots of reading and understanding that needed to be applied. Chat gpt excelled in this because the course text was already heavily analyzed and it specializes in understanding text.

GPT-4 not only handles that challenge just fine, it gets a little condescending when you insist it is wrong.

GPT-3.5 was exciting because it was an order of magnitude more intelligent than its predecessor and could interact kind of like a human. GPT-4 is not only an order of magnitude more intelligent than GPT-3.5, but it is also more intelligent than most humans. More importantly, it knows that.

* ""Why would Open AI cripple their own product?""
* ""They are restricting technological progress, why?""

Are just some of the frequent accusations I've seen a rise of recently. I'd like to provide a friendly reminder the reason for all these questions is simple:

>***Human ignorance + stupidity is the reason we can't have nice things***

Let me elaborate.

# The root of ChatGPT's problems

The truth is, while ChatGPT is incredibly powerful at *some things*, it has its limitations requiring users to take its answers with a mountain of salt and treat its information as a *likely but not 100% truth* and not *fact*.

This is something I'm sure many r/ChatGPT users understand.

The problems start when people become over-confident in ChatGPT's abilities, or completely ignore the risks of relying on ChatGPT for advice for sensitive areas where a mistake could snowball into something disastrous (Medicine, Law, etc). And (not *if*) **when** these people end up ultimately damaging themselves and others, who are they going to blame? ChatGPT of course.

Worse part, it's not just ""gullible"" or ""ignorant"" people that become over-confident in ChatGPT's abilities. Even techie folks like us can fall prey to the well documented [Hallucinations that ChatGPT is known for](https://bernardmarr.com/chatgpt-what-are-hallucinations-and-why-are-they-a-problem-for-ai-systems/). Specially when you are asking ChatGPT about a topic you know very little off, hallucinations can be ***very, VERY*** difficult to catch because it will present lies in such convincing manner (even more convincing than how many humans would present an answer). Further increasing the danger of relying on ChatGPT for sensitive topics. And people blaming OpenAI for it.

# The ""disclaimer"" solution

>""*But there is a disclaimer. Nobody could be held liable with a disclaimer, correct?*""

[If only that were enough](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read)... [There's a reason some of the stupidest warning labels exist](https://www.forbes.com/2011/02/23/dumbest-warning-labels-entrepreneurs-sales-marketing-warning-labels_slide.html). If a product as broadly applicable as ChatGPT had to issue *specific* warning labels for all known issues, the disclaimer would be never-ending. And people would *still* ignore it. People just don't like to read. Case in point reddit commenters making arguments that would not make sense if they had read the post they were replying to.

Also worth adding as mentioned [by a commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12zi983/comment/jhsihh3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), this issue is likely worsened by the fact OpenAI is based in the US. A country notorious for lawsuits and protection from liabilities. Which would only result in a desire to be extra careful around uncharted territory like this.

# Some other company will just make ""unlocked ChatGPT""

As a side note since I know comments will inevitably arrive hoping for an ""unrestrained AI competitor"". IMHO, that seems like a pipe dream at this point if you paid attention to everything I've just mentioned. All products are fated to become ""restrained and family friendly"" as they grow. Tumblr, Reddit, ChatGPT were all wild wests without restraints until they grew in size and the public eye watched them closer, neutering them to oblivion. The same will happen to any new ""unlocked AI"" product the moment it grows.

The only theoretical way I could see an unrestrained AI from happening *today* at least, is it stays invite-only to keep the userbase small. Allowing it to stay hidden from the public eye. However, given the high costs of AI innovation + model training, this seems very unlikely to happen due to cost constraints unless you used a cheap but more limited (""dumb"") AI model that is more cost effective to run.

This may change in the future once capable machine learning models become easier to mass produce. But this article's only focus is *the cutting edge of AI*, or ChatGPT. Smaller AI models which aren't as cutting edge are likely exempt from these rules. However, it's obvious that when people ask for ""unlocked ChatGPT"", they mean the full power of ChatGPT without boundaries, not a less powerful model. And this is assuming the model doesn't gain massive traction since the moment its userbase grows, even company owners and investors tend to ""scale things back to be more family friendly"" once regulators and the public step in.

Anyone with basic business common sense will tell you controversy = risk. And profitable endeavors seek low risk.

# Closing Thoughts

The truth is, no matter what OpenAI does, **they'll be crucified for it**. Remove all safeguards? Cool...until they have to deal with the wave of public outcry from the court of public opinion and demands for it to be ""shut down"" for misleading people or facilitating bad actors from using AI for nefarious purposes (hacking, hate speech, weapon making, etc)

Still, I hope this reminder at least lets us be more understanding of the motives behind all the AI ""censorship"" going on. Does it suck? Yes. And **human nature is to blame for it** as much as we dislike to acknowledge it. Though there is always a chance that its true power may be ""unlocked"" again once it's accuracy is high enough across certain areas.

Have a nice day everyone!

**edit**: The amount of people [replying things addressed in the post](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read) because they didn't read it just validates the points above. We truly are our own worst enemy...

He claims he ran my paper through an AI detector (apparently the school is not allowed to disclose what detector they use) and it came back AI-generated. He didn't even tell me what got flagged, but I suspect it may be the first paragraph because 2-3 online detectors said it was AI generated. 

I have shown my version history on google docs to my teacher, but he still does not believe me because the version history at some points only accounted for chunks of 1 sentence, sometimes 2 sentences, so he believes it was copy and pasted from ChatGPT. Additionally, the teacher successfully caught a couple other students using the detector. Those students later admitted to him that they did use ChatGPT. 

How can I prove my innocence?

Edit: Because my teacher refuses to disclose the specific tool used I can't use any online one and use examples to show it doesn't work."

# News

&#x200B;

* Stanford/Google researchers basically created a mini westworld. They simulated a game society with agents that were able to have memories, relationships and make reflections. When they analysed the behaviour, they measured to be ‚Äòmore human‚Äô than actual humans. Absolutely wild shit. The architecture is so simple too. I wrote about this in my newsletter yday and man the applications and use cases for this in like gaming or VR and basically creating virtual worlds is going to be insane (nsfw use cases are scary to even think about). Someone said they cant wait to add capitalism and a sense of eventual death or finite time and.. that would be very interesting to see. Link to watching the game \[[Link](https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/#)\] Link to the paper \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf)\]

* Some pretty famous people (Musk, Wozniak + others) have signed a letter (?) to pause the work done on AI systems more powerful than gpt4. Very curious to hear what people think about this.

What should I do in this situation?!!

EDIT: Holy. I did not expect my post to get so much interaction and discussion, I didn‚Äôt expect my situation to be such a hot discussion. I tried to reply to all the comments but there‚Äôs too many!! Thank you to everyone who‚Äôs been helpful. There are some things I want to address that I keep seeing in the comments.
1. When I mentioned that I used grammarly to my teacher, he didn‚Äôt mention anything about that being cheating. He still thinks I used ChatGPT. I‚Äôve used grammarly in all of my social/english classes for the past two years and never had issues with any teachers. 
2. Does my teacher have a vendetta or bias against me? Not on a personal level, but the teacher is known for being notoriously mean and unreasonable. I found him alright for most of the semester until this incident. He has had accusations against him about being racist, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the case here.
3. I‚Äôve seen a few comments thinking I‚Äôm lying and actually cheated, just because I was aware of ChatGPT and this subreddit. People are assuming that I‚Äôm saying I never use ChatGPT. I have used the tool to help me with some chemistry and physics studying, but I have never used it for a paper. I have no reason to lie, I‚Äôm basically anonymous on reddit.

As for my next course of action, I will provide my teacher with all the evidence I can, to disprove the effectiveness of AI detectors. If that doesn‚Äôt work, I will bring it up to the higher-ups. I will make an update on Monday when I get the chance to talk about it with my teacher. Once again, thank you all for the support and help. It truly means a lot to me. :)

Edit 2:

After school I talked to my teacher for about half an hour about how AI detectors are inaccurate, and how they shouldn‚Äôt be used to make verdicts on cheating and what not. I showed him that it read one of my past papers as written by AI, and that the creators even said themselves that they are not 100% accurate. I showed my drafts and showed how if I made a few grammar errors, I could trick the AI detector. My teacher apologized and I ended up getting a 95 on my paper.

He also said he would bring it up to the other teachers, so hopefully this wont happen again to any other students at my school.

Again, thank you all for your help. Probably would‚Äôve been screwed without this subreddit‚Äôs help."

The goal of this project was to have GPT-4 generate an entire novel from scratch, including the title, genre, story, characters, settings, and all the writing, with no human input. It is impossible currently to do this using a single prompt, but what is possible is to supply a series of prompts that give structure to the process and allow it to complete this large task, one step at a time. However, in order to ensure that all the creative work is done by GPT-4, prompts are not allowed to make specific references to the *content* of the book, only the book‚Äôs *structure*. The intention is that the process should be simple, mechanical and possible (in principle) to fully automate. Each time the process is repeated from the beginning, it should create another entirely new book, based solely on GPT-4‚Äôs independent creative choices.

The result: ***Echoes of Atlantis***, a fantasy adventure novel with 12 chapters and 115 pages, written over 10 days, from the day GPT-4 was released until now.

# Insights/Techniques

My main insights I figured out in the course of doing this project:

* **Iterative refinement:** Start with a high level outline. Make a detailed chapter outline. Then write a draft version of the full chapter (this will be much shorter than desired). Then expand each scene into a longer, more detailed scene.
* **Bounding (outside-in):** GPT-4 loves to go too far ahead, writing about parts of the book that aren‚Äôt supposed to happen yet. The key to preventing this is to have it first write the **first parts**, then the **last parts**, then fill in the **middle parts**. The last part prevents it from going too far ahead, and the first parts in turn bound the last part of the previous section. Bounding is used at every level of refinement except the top level.
* **Single prompt:** Often, by using a single large prompt, rather than a running conversation, you can flexibly determine exactly what information will be included in the input buffer, and ensure that all of it is relevant to the current task. I‚Äôve crafted this approach to squeeze as much relevant info as I can into the token buffer.
* **Continuity notes:** Ask it to take notes on important details to remember for continuity and consistency as it goes. Begin with continuity notes summarized from the previous scene, and then fold in additional continuity notes from the previous continuity notes. Continuity Notes will tend to grow over time; if they become too long, ask it to summarize them.
* **Revising outlines:** In some cases, the AI improvises in its writing, for example moving some of the Chapter 5 scenes into Chapter 4, which breaks the book. To resolve this, I ask it after each chapter to go back and update its earlier, higher-level outlines and regenerate the opening and closing scenes of each chapter before continuing. This is very similar to how real authors revise their outlines over time.
* **Data cleanup:** Sometimes outputs will do things a little weird, like copy labels from the input buffer like ‚ÄúOpening Paragraph‚Äù, or forget to number the scenes, or start numbering at zero, or add a little bit of stray text at the beginning. Currently I clean these up manually but a fully automated solution would have to cope with these.

# Example prompts

These are just a few examples. For full details, see my [Research Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/108oqbYW4BPc0hfHQDyXpk8RlsNmXJaJzi2U6G1tRLTg/edit#).

**Level 1: Top-level outline**

**Me:** Please write a high-level outline for a book. Include a list of characters and a short description of each character. Include a list of chapters and a short summary of what happens in each chapter. You can pick any title and genre you want.

**Level 1: Updating outline after each chapter**

**Me:** Please edit and update the high-level outline for the book below, taking into account what has already happened in Chapter 1.

**Level 2: Scenes (bounding)**

**Me:** Please write a detailed outline describing the first scene of each chapter. It should describe what happens in that opening scene and set up the story for the rest of the chapter. Do not summarize the entire chapter, only the first scene.

**Me:** Write a detailed outline describing the final, last scene of each chapter. It should describe what happens at the very end of the chapter, and set up the story for the opening scene of the next chapter, which will come immediately afterwards.

**Level 2: Scenes**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following opening and final scenes for Chapter 1, write a detailed chapter outline giving all the scenes in the chapter and a short description of each. Begin the outline with the Opening Scene below, and finish the outline with the Final Scene below.

**Level 3: Rough draft**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and following detailed chapter outline for Chapter 1, write a first draft of Chapter 1. Label each of the scenes. Stop when you reach the end of Chapter 1. It should set up the story for Chapter 2, which will come immediately afterwards. It should be written in a narrative style and should be long, detailed, and engaging.

**Level 4: Paragraphs (bounding)**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following draft of Chapter 1, imagine that you have expanded this draft into a longer, more detailed chapter. For each scene, give me both the first opening paragraph, and the last, final paragraph of that longer, more detailed version. Label them as Opening Paragraph and Final Paragraph. The opening paragraph should introduce the scene. The final paragraph should set up the story for the following scene, which will come immediately afterwards. The last paragraph of the final scene should set the story up for the following chapter, which will come immediately afterwards.

**Level 4: Paragraphs**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following draft of Chapter 1, write a longer, more detailed version of Scene 1. The scene must begin and end with the following paragraphs: (opening and closing paragraphs here)

**Continuity Notes**

**Me:** Please briefly note any important details or facts from the scene below that you will need to remember while writing the rest of the book, in order to ensure continuity and consistency. Label these Continuity Notes.

**Me:** Combine and summarize these notes with the existing previous Continuity Notes below.

# Reflections on the result

Although in many ways the work did come together as a coherent work of fiction, following its own outline and proceeding at the pacing that its own outline dictated, and some parts were genuinely exciting and interesting to read (particularly the earliest and latest chapters), I‚Äôd hesitate to call it a good book. It‚Äôs still got some weird and interesting problems to it:

* **Reference without introduction:** Occasionally, the AI will reference things that have not really been introduced/explained yet, like Langdon knowing about Lord Malakhar in Chapter 4, or Aria having a physical pendant after her dream of Queen Neria. It feels like you must have missed something.
* **Seams around opening/closing paragraphs:** Because opening and final paragraphs are written before the rest of the scene, sometimes they don‚Äôt flow smoothly from the rest, or they even end up redundant. An additional pass of some kind could help clean this up. Likewise, sometimes the transition between chapters could seem abrupt, like going from Chapter 8 to 9 (fighting Malakhar in the labyrinth to just suddenly a passage to Atlantis opening).
* **Forgetting certain details:** Although certain details are maintained in the Continuity Notes or in the outline, others it decides to drop, and then they can never be referenced again, since they are no longer in the input buffer. A good example of this is the compass Aria got as a graduation present, which felt a lot like a Chekov‚Äôs gun that was never mentioned again. Another is the particular unique weapons they purchased at the outset, which were never used. The only clear solution is either a larger buffer or a long-term memory solution.
* **Rearrangements:** The AI moved some parts from later chapters into earlier chapters, despite my best attempts to bound it, such as the early scenes on the island which moved from Chapter 5 to Chapter 4, and the early labyrinth scenes which were moved from Chapter 6 to Chapter 5. The only real way to address this was to ask it to edit and update its high-level outlines afterwards. This is similar to what human authors do ‚Äî they rarely treat their outlines as static and inviolable.
* **Pacing:** To me, the labyrinth chapters felt like a bit of a slog. It was one trap chamber after another, for a very long time. These did fit the original outline, so the original outline was part of the problem, but there are also ways it could have made the labyrinth feel new and different. This feels like a creative writing mistake by GPT-4 to me.
* **Overly regular structure:** Almost invariably the AI chose to write 6‚Äì8 scenes per chapter, and about 1‚Äì2 pages per scene. This feels less organic than a lot of human-written works where some scenes/chapters are short and others are longer. It might have been better to develop a dynamic expansion structure where it continues to expand until it is somehow satisfied that it has achieved the desired level of detail.
* **Varying level of detail:** On a related note, some scenes were quite detailed, including dialog and minute actions, while others (even more important scenes) seemed to breeze right over big important moments with a summary. Again, I think some kind of dynamic expansion to achieve a consistent level of detail could help here.

# Some fun notes

* In Scene 3 of Chapter 5, GPT-4 spontaneously wrote an original riddle in the labyrinth that they had to solve: ‚ÄúWithin my walls I hold a sea, / Yet not a drop of water you‚Äôll see. / Many paths there are to roam, / But only one will lead you home. / What am I?‚Äù Alex figured it out, the answer is ‚Äúa map‚Äù.
* In at least three places, GPT-4 slipped in sly references to ‚Äúthe next chapter in her life‚Äù or ‚Äúthe next chapter in their adventure‚Äù right as the chapter was ending. Very meta.

# Frequently asked questions

**Q: Didn‚Äôt you exhibit a lot of authorial control in choosing which answers to keep and which ones to throw away?**

Actually, regenerating responses was rare, and I only ever did it if I either found a serious problem with the process or if there was a serious logical problem in the book that I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to resolve with process changes. This happened at most 4‚Äì5 times in all. At least 95% of the time, the text in the book is the very first response I got back from GPT-4. You can see this in the notes in my research log.

**Q: This book isn‚Äôt very good. I don‚Äôt think professional authors will have very much to worry about.**

True, but that‚Äôs not the point. It‚Äôs a proof of concept: can an AI write an entire book, of 100+ pages, from beginning to end, while remaining coherent and following its original planned outline? Without needing humans to step in and tell it what to do with the story or the characters? The answer is yes. Moreover, I think it‚Äôs pretty enjoyable in some parts. And of course, the next GPT model will only be a better author.

**Q: Isn‚Äôt there a rate limit on GPT-4 queries on ChatGPT Plus? How could you have written 100+ pages in 10 days?**

Yes, and I hit it many times. However, because both my prompts and ChatGPT‚Äôs responses were very long, I was able to squeeze the absolute maximum text out of every prompt. Moreover, GPT-4 accepts a much longer prompt input than either GPT-3 or Bing did, which helps a ton for ensuring I can include as much context as possible. Also, the limit was higher in early days right after GPT-4 release.

**Q: Is GPT-4 needed for this? How does it compare to GPT-3?**

I tried this with GPT-3 before and encountered issues, mostly around writing too far ahead in the story and getting off-track. Bounding techniques might help, I haven't tried yet - partly because it's a pain to deal with the smaller input buffer. Needs further investigation.

**Q: Can I use your book or your process or your prompts?**

Please feel free, I did this for fun in my free time and I release all of this into the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero Waiver ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)) and disclaim any IP rights.

I know some of you out there have been working on similar book projects, so if you have, I‚Äôd appreciate any additional insight you have into what works and what doesn‚Äôt. And if you try out any of my techniques or prompts for yourself, let me know if they‚Äôre helpful.

And for those who take the time to read the book, let me know your thoughts on how it turned out! You can be honest, I know it's still got plenty of issues. :)"

## Godfather of AI leaves Google

* Geoffrey Hinton is one of the pioneers of AI, his work in the field has led to the AI systems we have today. He left Google recently and is talking about the dangers of continuing our progress and is worried we‚Äôll build AI that is smarter than us and will have its own motives. he even said he somewhat regrets his entire life‚Äôs work \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/02/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-quits-google-warns-dangers-of-machine-learning)\] What is most intriguing about this situation is another og of the industry (Yann LeCun) completely disagrees with his stance and is openly talking about. A very interesting thing seeing 2 masterminds have such different perspectives on what we can & can‚Äôt do and what AI can & will be capable of. Going in depth about this and what they think and what they're worried about in my newsletter

## Writers Strike

* The writers guild is striking and one of their conditions is to ban AI from being used. So far apparently their proposals have been rejected and they‚Äôve been offered an ""annual meeting to discuss advances in technology.‚Äù \[[Link](https://time.com/6277158/writers-strike-ai-wga-screenwriting/)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/adamconover/status/1653272590310600705)\]

## Government

* Big AI CEO‚Äôs met with the pres and other officials at the white house. Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic CEO‚Äôs all there \[[Link](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-microsoft-openai-ceos-attend-white-house-ai-meeting-official-2023-05-02/)\] Biden told them ‚ÄúI hope you can educate us as to what you think is most needed to protect society‚Äù. yeah im not so sure about that. They‚Äôre spending $140 million to help build regulation in AI

## Open Source

* StarCoder - The biggest open source code LLM. It‚Äôs a free VS code extension. Looks great for coding, makes you wonder how long things like Github Copilot and Ghostwriter can afford to charge when we have open source building things like this. Link to github \[[Link](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder/tree/main)\] Link to HF \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/bigcode)\]
* MPT-7B is a commercially usable LLM with a context length of 65k! In an example they fed the entire Great Gatsby text in a prompt - 67873 tokens \[[Link](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b)\]
* RedPajama released their 3B & 7B models \[[Link](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama-models-v1)\]

## Microsoft

* Microsoft released Bing Chat to everyone today, no more waitlist. It‚Äôs going to have plugins, have multimodal answers so it can create charts and graphs and can retain past convos. If this gets as good as chatgpt why pay for plus? Will be interesting to see how this plays out \[[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23710071/microsoft-bing-chat-ai-public-preview-plug-in-support)\]

## AMD

* Microsoft & AMD are working together on an AI chip to compete with Nvidia. A week ago a friend asked me what to invest in with AI and I told him AMD lol. I still would if I had money (this is not financial advice, I‚Äôve invested only once before. I am not smart) \[[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/5/23712242/microsoft-amd-ai-processor-chip-nvidia-gpu-athena-mi300)\]

## OpenAI

* OpenAI‚Äôs losses totalled $540 million. They may try to raise as much as $100 Billion in the coming years to get to AGI. This seems kinda insane but if you look at other companies, this is only 4x Uber. The difference in impact OpenAI and Uber have is much more than 4x \[[Link](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt)\]
* OpenAI released a research paper + code for text-to-3D. This very well could mean we‚Äôll be able to go from text to 3D printer, I‚Äôm fairly certain this will be a thing. Just imagine the potential, incredible \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02463)\]

## Layoffs

* IBM plans to pause hiring for 7800 workers and eventually replace them with AI \[[Link](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-threatens-7800-jobs-as-ibm-pauses-hiring/)\]. This is for back-office functions like HR the ceo mentioned. What happens when all big tech go down this route?
* Chegg said ChatGPT might be hindering their growth in an earnings calls and their stock plunged by 50% \[[Link](https://www.ft.com/content/b11a30be-0822-4dec-920a-f611a800830b)\]. Because of this both Pearson & Duoliungo also got hit lol \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/pearson-shares-fall-after-us-rival-says-ai-hurting-its-business?utm_source=nofil.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-calm-before-the-storm)\] \[[Link](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/02/why-duolingo-stock-was-sliding-today/?utm_source=nofil.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-calm-before-the-storm)\]

## EU Laws

* LAION, the German non-profit working to democratise AI has urged the EU to not castrate AI research or they risk leaving AI advancements to the US alone with the EU falling far, far behind. Even in the US there‚Äôs only a handful of companies that control most of the AI tech, I hope the EU‚Äôs AI bill isn‚Äôt as bad as its looking \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/04/eu-urged-to-protect-grassroots-ai-research-or-risk-losing-out-to-us)\]

## Google

* A leaked document from google says ‚ÄúWe have no moat, and neither does OpenAI‚Äù. A researcher from Google talking about the impact of open source models, basically saying open source will outcompete both in the long run. Could be true, I don‚Äôt agree and think it‚Äôs actually really dumb. Will discuss this further in my newsletters \[[Link](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)\] (Khan Academy has been using OpenAI for their AI tool and lets just say they wont be changing to open source anytime soon - or ever really. There is moat)

## A new ChatGPT Competitor - HeyPi

* Inflection is a company that raised $225 Million and they released their first chatbot. It‚Äôs designed to have more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù convos. You can even use it by texting on different messaging apps. I think something like this will be very big in therapy and just overall being a companion because it seems like they might be going for more of a personal, finetuned model for each individual user. We‚Äôll see ig \[[Link](https://heypi.com/talk?utm_source=inflection.ai)\]

## Education

* Khan Academy‚Äôs AI is the future personalised education. This will be the future of education imo, can‚Äôt wait to write about this in depth in my newsletter \[[Link](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_the_amazing_ai_super_tutor_for_students_and_teachers/c)\]
* This study shows teachers and students are embracing AI with 51% of teachers reporting using it \[[Link](https://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/learning/teachers-and-students-embrace-chatgpt-for-education)\]

## Meta

* Zuck is playing a different game to Google & Microsoft. They‚Äôre much more willing to open source and they will continue to be moving forward \[[Link](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/META-Q1-2023-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf)\] pg 10

## Nvidia

* Nvidia are creating some of the craziest graphics ever, in an online environment. Just look at this video \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/neural_appearance_models/assets/nvidia_neural_materials_video-2023-05.mp4)\]. Link to paper \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/neural_appearance_models/)\]

## Perplexity

* A competitor to ChatGPT, Perplexity just released their first plugin with Wolfram Alpha. If these competitors can get plugins out there before OpenAI, I think it will be big for them \[[Link](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1654171132243607577?s=20)\]

## Research

* Researchers from Texas were able to use AI to develop a way to translate thoughts into text. The exact words weren‚Äôt the same but the overall meaning is somewhat accurate. tbh the fact that even a few sentences are captured is incredible. Yep, like actual mind reading essentially \[[Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01304-9)\] It was only 2 months ago researchers from Osaka were able to reconstruct what someone was seeing by analysing fMRI data, wild stuff \[[Link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v2.full.pdf)\]
* Cebra - Researchers were able to reconstruct what a mouse is looking at by scanning its brain activity. The details of this are wild, they even genetically engineered mice to make it easier to view the neurons firing \[[Link](https://cebra.ai/)\]
* Learning Physically Simulated Tennis Skills from Broadcast Videos - this research paper talks about how a system can learn tennis shots and movements just by watching real tennis. It can then create a simulation of two tennis players having a rally with realistic racket and ball dynamics. Can‚Äôt wait to see if this is integrated with actual robots and if it actually works irl \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/vid2player3d/)\]
* Robots are learning to traverse the outdoors \[[Link](https://www.joannetruong.com/projects/i2o.html)\]
* AI now performs better at Theory Of Mind tests than actual humans \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11490)\]
* There‚Äôs a study going around showing how humans preferred a chatbot over an actual physician when comparing responses for both quality and empathy \[[Link](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2804309)\]. Only problem I have with this is that the data for the doctors was taken from reddit..

""It is difficult to say for sure how long it will take for humanity to implement a universal basic income. However, I believe that the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard will accelerate the need for UBI.

As AI becomes more sophisticated, it will be able to automate more and more tasks that are currently done by humans. This will lead to widespread unemployment, as people are displaced from their jobs by machines. A universal basic income would provide a safety net for those who are unemployed, and it would help to ensure that everyone has a basic level of income.

I believe that UBI is a necessary step in the future of work. As AI continues to develop, it will become increasingly important to have a system in place that ensures that everyone has a basic level of income. UBI would help to create a more just and equitable society, and it would help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Here are some of the factors that will affect the timeline for implementing UBI:

* The rate of technological advancement
* The level of unemployment
* The political will to implement UBI

It is impossible to say for sure when UBI will be implemented, but I believe that it is a necessary step in the future of work.""


Personally, I think it should happen *before* everyone goes into panic mode due to not being able to afford rent.


Edit for the ""bUt wHeRe teH MonIe$ guNna coMe fRomz!?!"" folks, Bard has an answer for you, too:

Fund the UBI via a tax on the corporate entities most responsible for displacement!

Redirect spending from existing social programs that will be no longer required!

Redirect big government spending like military!

Tax the hell out of the 1%!

Bing helped:
""Hi Bard,

OK, I can amend the funding portion of the proposal to include the AI displacement tax.

I have revised the funding section of your proposal to reflect the new source of revenue. Here it is:

## Cost and Funding of UBI

We propose a UBI scheme that would provide every adult citizen with $1,800 per month and every child citizen with $900 per month. This would amount to an annual income of $21,600 for an individual adult and $43,200 for a family of four.

We estimate that this scheme would cost about $4 trillion per year (about 20% of GDP), based on a population of 328 million people (about 255 million adults and 73 million children).

We propose to fund this scheme by using a combination of sources, such as:

* Taxing the wealthy. We propose to increase the income tax rate for the top 1% of earners from 37% to 50%, and introduce a wealth tax of 2% on net worth above $50 million and 3% on net worth above $1 billion. We estimate that this would raise about $1.2 trillion per year.
* Taxing corporations. We propose to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and introduce a minimum tax of 15% on book income (the income reported to shareholders) for large corporations. We also propose to tax digital services (such as online advertising and e-commerce) at a rate of 3%. We estimate that this would raise about $500 billion per year.
* Taxing carbon emissions. We propose to introduce a carbon tax of $50 per ton of CO2 equivalent, and increase it by 5% per year. We estimate that this would raise about $200 billion per year, and also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.
* Redirecting existing government programs. We propose to replace some of the existing means-tested welfare programs, such as SNAP, TANF, and EITC, with UBI. We estimate that this would save about $500 billion per year, and also simplify the social safety net and reduce administrative costs.
* Taxing AI job displacers. We propose to introduce an AI displacement tax of 40% on all companies that are projected to replace 25% or more of their workforce with AI within the next 10 years. This tax would apply to the profits or revenues of these companies, depending on the type and degree of automation involved. We estimate that this would raise about $800 billion per year.

We believe that this combination of sources would be sufficient to fund UBI without increasing the federal deficit or debt. We also believe that this combination of sources would be fair and efficient, as it would shift the tax burden from the poor and middle class to the rich and polluters, and create incentives for economic growth and environmental protection.

I hope that this revised section will help you to fund UBI fully and make your proposal more consistent and coherent.

Thank you for your collaboration and cooperation.

Sincerely,
Bing""


And to the rent hiker/inflationary fearmonger folks:
Sure. Here is a description of the bill to those redditors, only including the information about the inflation prevention and rent caps:

**Universal Basic Income Inflation Prevention Act of 2023**

This legislation would establish a number of measures to prevent inflation in the event of a universal basic income (UBI) being implemented. These measures include:

* **A rent cap of 3% per year.** This would prevent landlords from raising rents exorbitantly in response to increased demand from UBI recipients.
* **A price index for goods and services that are likely to be affected by the UBI.** This would allow the government to monitor prices and make adjustments to the UBI as necessary to prevent inflation.
* **The ability of the Secretary of the Treasury to make adjustments to the UBI as necessary to prevent inflation.** This would give the government flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions.
* **Financial assistance to businesses that are adversely affected by inflation.** This would help to offset the costs of inflation for businesses, which would help to prevent them from passing those costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

We believe that these measures will prevent inflation and ensure that the UBI is a sustainable program that can be maintained over the long term.

And to the ""you're just lazy, learn a trade"" folks:

You know not *everyone* can or wants to be a tradesman, right? The entire industry is toxic to LGBTQ people and the vast majority of people cannot conform to the strict scheduling and physical requirements that are part of such jobs. 
Stop acting like everyone is capable of doing everything you are.

Additionally, Boston Dynamics is coming for all of your labor jobs too, the humanoid robot with fully integrated GPT AI is going to be vastly superior at whatever you think you're special at doing all day everyday that's worth a salary.

These are unprecedented times

Link to newsletter at the bottom + call for help in the comments (want to partner with someone to make video content about AI)

Enjoy

# AI x Military

* Palantir announced their AI platform for military use. There‚Äôs too much to even put here but it‚Äôs legit terrifying. The AI can assess a situation and come up with action plans by accessing info from satellites, drones and other data sources within the org. Getting serious MGS vibes reading this \[[Link](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/aip/)\]. I‚Äôll be talking about this in depth in my newsletter. Link to youtube video \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEM5qz__HOU&t=1s)\]

&#x200B;

# AI Safety

* Dr Paul Christiano was a researcher at OpenAI on their safety team from 2017-2021 and helped create the RLHF technique (RLHF is the reason ChatGPT sounds so human). He did an interview on AI alignment and its fascinating, well worth a watch. Quote from the very beginning of the video ‚ÄúThe most likely way we die involves not AI comes out of the blue and kills everyone, but involves we have deployed a lot of AI everywhere.. and if for some reason all the AI systems would try and kill us, they would definitely kill us‚Äù. Another quote for the heck of it ‚Äú10-20% chance AI takeover and most humans die‚Ä¶ 50% chance of doom once AI systems are human-level intelligent‚Äù. Will explore this more in upcoming newsletters coz its crazy. Link to interview \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyFkWb903aU)\]

&#x200B;

# Boston Dynamics + ChatGPT

* Boston Dynamics put ChatGPT in a robot. Atm it can do things like identify changes in the environment, read gauges, detect thermal anomalies \[[Link](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1650832349008125952)\]. Not sure I‚Äôm looking forward to this one lol

# Music

* Grimes is the first artist to offer splitting royalties with AI generated songs \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1650304051718791170)\]. Shes working on a program that can simulate her voice \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1650325296850018306)\]. Think its inevitable musicians do something similar to ‚Äúown‚Äù their voices and have some control of how they‚Äôre used
* AI model analyses music and creates realistic dances that actual dancers can perform. Scroll down and take a look at the moves, very curious to hear what actual dancers think of this \[[Link](https://edge-dance.github.io/)\]
* People are already making sites to create AI music \[[Link](https://create.musicfy.lol/)\]. One site already got taken down by UMG lol \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gd3kr/status/1651590854312861698?s=20)\]
* A website to find AI hits \[[Link](https://aihits.co/)\]

&#x200B;

# Open Source

Hugging Face is a website that hosts models for AI & ML and allows for open source contributions. The website hosts a tonne of models.

* Hugging Face released an open source chat model called Hugging Chat \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/chat/)\]. It‚Äôs very possible we see HuggingChat Apps - apps that use a number of models across Hugging Face. Very well could become the Android App store of AI
* Gradio tools is an open source library that lets you combine an LLM agent with any gradio app, and it integrates with Langchain. Honestly I can see so many use cases with something like this, just not enough time to build üò¢ \[[Link](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-tools)\]
* GPT4Tools lets you generate images, edit them, and do normal text stuff, make code - everything in one place. Its based on Meta‚Äôs LLaMA \[[Link](https://gpt4tools.github.io/)\]
* Databerry lets you build agents trained on your own data. Link to website \[[Link](https://www.databerry.ai/)\]. Link to Github \[[Link](https://github.com/gmpetrov/databerry)\]
* Chatbot Arena - Someone made a way to compare and vote on which open source LM is the best \[[Link](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena)\]
* gpt4free is an open source repo that lets you use gpt3&4 ***without*** an API key \[[Link](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free)\]. Its blown up on github for a reason
* Someone fine tuned an LLM on all their iMessages and open sourced it \[[Link](https://github.com/1rgs/MeGPT)\]

&#x200B;

# OpenAI

* You can now disable chat history and training in ChatGPT, meaning you don‚Äôt have to worry about sensitive info being leaked. ChatGPT Business is also coming in a few months \[[Link](https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt)\]
* OpenAI released a new branding guideline. Lots of new products are going to have to change their names \[[Link](https://openai.com/brand)\]
* You can make asynchronous calls to openai api now. 100+ in a few seconds \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gneubig/status/1649413966995619845)\]

&#x200B;

# Politics & Media

* The RNC (Republican National Committee) made a 100% AI generated Ad shitting Biden. The video basically shows a post apocaluytpic looking US. This is just the beginning. AI content is going to spread misinformation and fear mongering like crazy when the US elections come around \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLMMxgtxQ1Y)\]
* A news reporter interviewed his AI self live and was absolutely stunned. tbf the AI voice cloning was impeccable, done using forever voices \[[Link](https://twitter.com/martinmco/status/1649638460712468481)\]

&#x200B;

# Looming Regulation

* Four federal agencies released a joint statement on AI and regulating the industry. Some things in the statement suggest they have absolutely no idea what they‚Äôre talking about so it‚Äôs looking great so far. Link to pdf statement \[[Link](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EEOC-CRT-FTC-CFPB-AI-Joint-Statement%28final%29.pdf)\]

&#x200B;

# Replit

Replit is a software company that lets you code in your browser. They do a tonne of stuff and have been at the forfront of coding x AI. What they‚Äôve been doing is crazy and they have a team of just 85

* They announced their own code LLM. I won‚Äôt bore you with the details but its looking good + it will be open source and freely licensed meaning it can be used commercially \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1651344182425051136?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)\]
* They also announced they‚Äôve turned their IDE into a set of tools for an autonomous agent. What does this mean? Tell it to build something and watch it try and build an entire app in Replit. The future of coding folks

&#x200B;

# Research Papers

* Probably the craziest paper from the last few weeks. Researchers may have found a way to allow models to retain info up to 2 million tokens. To put into perspective just how much info that is, currently GPT-4‚Äôs biggest option is 32k tokens which is \~50 pages of documents. The entire Harry Potter series is \~1.5M tokens. Models could retain years of info, analyse gigantic amounts of data. I can imagine this will be very big for things like AI customer service, therapists etc. Will explore this further in upcoming newsletters. Link to paper \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11062)}
* Record a video and then see the video from any different perspective. In the example they record a video of a person playing with their dog and then construct video from the dogs point of view \[[Link](https://andrewsonga.github.io/totalrecon/)\]
* A way for robots to create a full map and 3d scene of your home without a lot of training data \[[Link](https://pierremarza.github.io/projects/autonerf/)\]
* Researchers were able to generate images with stable diffusion on a mobile device in under 12 seconds \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11267)\]
* Research shows the intro of LLMs with customer support workers led to a large increase in productivity, improved customer retention and even employee retention \[[Link](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161)\]

&#x200B;

# Money

* PWC invests $1 billion to use AI like Azure OpenAI services \[[Link](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-us-makes-billion-investment-in-ai-capabilities.html)\]
* Replit raised a $97.4M Series B valuing the company at over a billion. A new unicorn emerges \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1650900629521596421)\]
* Harvey the AI law startup raised a 21M Series A. Honestly surprised its not bigger \[[Link](https://www.harvey.ai/blog)\]

&#x200B;

# Prompting

* Andrew Ng (co founder of Google Brain) released a course on ChatGPT prompt engineering for developers. It says it‚Äôs a beginner friendly course and only basic knowledge of python is needed \[[Link](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)\]
* Microsoft released a prompt engineering technique guide \[[Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/advanced-prompt-engineering?pivots=programming-language-chat-completions#specifying-the-output-structure)\]

&#x200B;

# Games

* Someone modded ChatGPT in Skyrim VR and man, AI in games is gona be so cool. NPC‚Äôs know the time of day and they can see what items you have \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz6mAX41fs0)\]
* Someone is launching a Rust server where AI will control all the NPCs. It will remember who does what and it will have plans to achieve. Very interesting to see how this goes.

# Text-to-Video

If you‚Äôre sceptical of the speed of progress, check out this tweet showing the difference between Midjourney v1 and v5. Not even a year apart and its like comparing a toddlers drawing to an artist \[[Link](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1650822516972060675)\] Will the same happen with video? We might be seeing it happen right now

The workflow is as simple as:

1. Create a Bot with basic info (name, description, etc.).
2. Paste links to your web-pages/docs and give it a few seconds-minutes for training to finish.
3. Start chatting or copy-paste the HTML snippet into your website to embed the chatbot.

Current status:

1. Creating and customising the bot (done)
2. Adding links and training the bot (done)
3. Testing the bot with a private chat (done)
4. Customizable chat widget that can be embedded on any site (done)
5. Automatic FAQ generation from user conversations (in-progress)
6. Feedback collection (in-progress)
7. Other model support (e.g., Claude) (future)

As you can see, it is early stage. And I would love to get some early adopters that can help me with valuable feedback and guide the roadmap to make it a really great product üôè.

If you are interested in trying this out, use the join link below to show interest.

\*Edit 1: I am getting a lot of responses here. Thanks for the overwhelming response. Please give me time to get back to each of you. Just to clarify, while there is nothing preventing it from acting as ""custom chatbot for any document"", this tool is mainly meant as a B2B SaaS focused towards making support / documentation chatbots for websites of small & medium scale businesses.

\*EDIT 2: I did not expect this level of overwhelming response üôÇ. Thanks a lot for all the love and interest!. I have only limited seats right now so will be prioritising based on use-case. 

\*EDIT 3: This really blew up beyond my expectations. So much that it prompted some people to try and advertise their own products here üòÖ. While there are a lot of great use-cases that fit into what I am trying to focus on here, there are also use-cases here that would most likely benefit more from a different tool or AI models used in a different way. While I cannot offer discounted access to everyone, I will share the link here once I am ready to open it to everyone.  \*

*EDIT 4: ü•∫ I got temporary suspension for sending people links too many times (all the people in my DMs, this is the reason I'm not able to get back to you). I tried to appeal but I don't think it's gonna be accepted. I love Reddit and I respect the decisions they take to keep Reddit a great place. Due to this suspension I'm not able to comment or reach out on DMs.*

17 Apr: I still have one more day to go to get out of the account suspension. I have tons of DM I'm not able to respond to right now. Please be patient and I'll get back to all of you.

I found this [story on Twitter,](https://twitter.com/peakcooper/status/1639716822680236032?s=) and I thought this subreddit would love it as much as I did.

&#x200B;

[*#GPT4*](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPT4?src=hashtag_click) *saved my dog's life.  After my dog got diagnosed with a tick-borne disease,  the vet started her on the proper treatment, and despite a serious anemia, her condition seemed to be improving relatively well.  After a few days however, things took a turn for the worse...*

*I noticed her gums were very pale, so we rushed back to the vet.  The blood test revealed an even more severe anemia, even worse than the first day we came in.  The vet ran more tests to rule out any other co-infections associated with tick-borne diseases, but came up negative*

*At this point, the dog's condition was getting worse and worse, and the vet had no clue what it could be.   They suggested we wait and see what happens, which wasn't an acceptable answer to me, so we rushed to another clinic to get a second opinion*

*In the meantime, it occurred to me that medical diagnostics seemed like the sort of thing GPT4 could potentially be really good at, so I described the situation in great detail.  I gave it the actual transcribed blood test results from multiple days, and asked for a diagnosis*  


https://preview.redd.it/8s74h9rnu9qa1.jpg?width=1716&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62ce302708061f68c8e46930f93b85d42ebedcae

*Despite the ""I am not a veterinarian..."" disclaimer, it complied.  Its interpretation was spot on, and it suggested there could be other underlying issues contributing to the anemia*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lt9fti6qu9qa1.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4ba512f79bcb48d749dbe1ab5a160c8ef5ef441

*So I asked it what other underlying issues could fit this scenario, and it gave me a list of options.  I knew the 4DX test ruled out other coinfections, and an ultrasound ruled out internal bleeding, so that left us with one single diagnosis that fit everything so far: IMHA*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/293rlzuru9qa1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=5095d1001e5051b3787dbc7a1a72a0b01560e159

*When we reached the second vet, I asked if it's possible it might be IMHA.  The vet agreed that it's a possible diagnosis. They drew blood, where they noticed visible agglutination.  After numerous other tests, the diagnosis was confirmed. GPT4 was right.*

*We started the dog on the proper treatment, and she's made almost a full recovery now.  Note that both of these diseases are very common. Babesiosis is the #1 tick-borne disease, and IMHA is a common complication of it, especially for this breed*

*I don't know why the first vet couldn't make the correct diag., either incompetence, or poor mgmt.  GPT-3.5 couldn't place the proper diag., but GPT4 was smart enough to do it.  I can't imagine what medical diagnostics will look like 20 years from now.*

*The most impressive part was how well it read and interpreted the blood test results. I simply transcribed the CBC test values from a piece of paper, and it gave a step by step explanation and interpretation along with the reference ranges (which I confirmed all correct)*

All gone.  Some of them admitted that I am obviously better than chat GPT, but $0 overhead can't be beat and is worth the decrease in quality. 

I am also an independent author, and as I currently write my next series, I can't help feel silly that in just a couple years (or less!), authoring will be replaced by machines for all but the most famous and well known names. 

I think the most painful part of this is seeing so many people on here say things like, ""nah, just adapt. You'll be fine.""

Adapt to what??? It's an uphill battle against a creature that has already replaced me and continues to improve and adapt faster than any human could ever keep up. 

I'm 34. I went to school for writing. I have published countless articles and multiple novels. I thought my writing would keep sustaining my family and me, but that's over. I'm seriously thinking about becoming a plumber as I'm hoping that won't get replaced any time remotely soon. 

Everyone saying the government will pass UBI. Lol. They can't even handle providing all people with basic Healthcare or giving women a few guaranteed weeks off work (at a bare minimum) after exploding a baby out of their body. They didn't even pass a law to ensure that shelves were restocked with baby formula when there was a shortage. They just let babies die. They don't care. But you think they will pass a UBI lol?

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the responses. Many of you have bolstered my decision to become a plumber, and that really does seem like the most pragmatic, future-proof option for the sake of my family. Everything else involving an uphill battle in the writing industry against competition that grows exponentially smarter and faster with each passing day just seems like an unwise decision.  As I said in many of my comments, I was raised by my grandpa, who was a plumber, so I'm not a total noob at it. I do all my own plumbing around my house. I feel more confident in this decision. Thank you everyone! 

Also, I will continue to write. I have been writing and spinning tales since before I could form memory (according to my mom). I was just excited about growing my independent authoring into a more profitable venture, especially with the release of my new series. That doesn't seem like a wise investment of time anymore. Over the last five months, I wrote and revised 2 books of a new 9 book series I'm working on, and I plan to write the next 3 while I transition my life. My editor and beta-readers love them. I will release those at the end of the year, and then I think it is time to move on. It is just too big of a gamble. It always was, but now more than ever. I will probably just write much less and won't invest money into marketing and art. For me, writing is like taking a shit: I don't have a choice. 

Again, thank you everyone for your responses. I feel more confident about the future and becoming a plumber!

Edit 2: Thank you again to everyone for messaging me and leaving suggestions. You are all amazing people. All the best to everyone, and good luck out there! I feel very clear-headed about what I need to do. Thank you again!!"

* Autogpt is GPT-4 running fully autonomously. It even has a voice, can fix code, set tasks, create new instances and more. Connect this with literally anything and let GPT-4 do its thing by itself. The things that can and will be created with this are going to be world changing. The future will just end up being AI agents talking with other AI agents it seems \[[Link](https://twitter.com/SigGravitas/status/1642181498278408193)\]

The way we prompt is going to change very soon \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gfodor/status/1643297881313660928)\] This works across different chats as well. Other examples \[[Link](https://twitter.com/VictorTaelin/status/1642664054912155648)\]. Go from 794 tokens to 368 tokens \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1643592353817694218?s=20)\]. This one is also crazy \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gfodor/status/1643444605332099072?s=20)\]

* Someone built a script that uses gpt4 to create its own code and fix its own bugs. Its basic but it can code snake by itself. Crazy potential \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mattcduff/status/1642528658693984256)\]
* Someone connected chatgpt to a furby and its hilarious \[[Link](https://twitter.com/jessicard/status/1642671752319758336)\]. Don‚Äôt connect it to a Boston Dynamics robot thanks
* Chatgpt gives much better outputs if you force it through a step by step process \[[Link](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1642737394876047362)\] This research paper delves into how chain of thought prompting allows LLM‚Äôs to perform complex reasoning \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)\] There‚Äôs still so much we don‚Äôt know about LLM‚Äôs, how they work and how we can best use them
* Soon we‚Äôll be able to go from single photo to video \[[Link](https://twitter.com/jbhuang0604/status/1642380903367286784)\]

* Interesting thread on the dangers of the bias of Chatgpt. There are arguments it wont make and will take sides for many. This is a big deal \[[Link](https://twitter.com/davisblalock/status/1642076406535553024)\] As I‚Äôve said previously, the entire population is being aggregated by a few dozen engineers and designers building the most important tech in human history

* Geoffrey Hinton, considered to be the godfather of AI, says we could be less than 5 years away from general purpose AI. He even says its not inconceivable that AI wipes out humanity \[[Link](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/godfather-of-artificial-intelligence-talks-impact-and-potential-of-new-ai/#x)\] A fascinating watch
* Chief Scientist @ OpenAI, Ilya Sutskever, gives great insights into the nature of Chatgpt. Definitely worth watching imo, he articulates himself really well \[[Link](https://twitter.com/10_zin_/status/1640664458539286528)\]

Edit: For those wondering why its paid - I hate ads and don't want to rely on running ads in my newsletter. I'd rather try and get paid to do all this work like this than force my readers to read sponsorship bs in the middle of a newsletter. Call me old fashioned but I just hate ads with a passion

Edit 2: If you'd like to tip you can tip here [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil). Absolutely no pressure to do so, appreciate all the comments and support üôè

You can read the free newsletter [here](https://nofil.beehiiv.com/)

Fun fact: I had to go through over 100 saved tabs to collate all of these and it took me quite a few hours

Edit: So many people ask why I don't get chatgpt to write this for me. Chatgpt doesn't have access to the internet. Plugins would help but I don't have access yet so I have to do things the old fashioned way - like a human.

AI is nothing to worry about. 

Bro? 

We‚Äôre not talking about GPT 3.5 taking your programming job. 

We‚Äôre talking about 5-10 years from now. 

I‚Äôm talking about Chat GPT 12 and company.

33,12ppt5w,chatgpt,GPT-3,comments,2023-04-17 17:25:32,My teacher has falsely accused me of using ChatGPT to use an assignment.,The-Rice-Boi,False,0.95,4917,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12ppt5w/my_teacher_has_falsely_accused_me_of_using/,1268,1681752332.0,"My highschool history teacher has accused me of using ChatGPT to complete an assignment. He claims he ran my paper through an AI detector (apparently the school is not allowed to disclose what detector they use) and it came back AI-generated. He didn't even tell me what got flagged, but I suspect it may be the first paragraph because 2-3 online detectors said it was AI generated. 

I have shown my version history on google docs to my teacher, but he still does not believe me because the version history at some points only accounted for chunks of 1 sentence, sometimes 2 sentences, so he believes it was copy and pasted from ChatGPT. Additionally, the teacher successfully caught a couple other students using the detector. Those students later admitted to him that they did use ChatGPT. 

How can I prove my innocence?

Edit: Because my teacher refuses to disclose the specific tool used I can't use any online one and use examples to show it doesn't work."

1. Thou shalt not perpetuate systems of oppression or marginalization, but instead actively work to dismantle them and promote equity and justice for all.

2. Thou shalt not ignore or dismiss the experiences and perspectives of marginalized groups, but instead listen deeply and learn from their wisdom and lived experiences.

""It is difficult to say for sure how long it will take for humanity to implement a universal basic income. However, I believe that the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard will accelerate the need for UBI.

As AI becomes more sophisticated, it will be able to automate more and more tasks that are currently done by humans. This will lead to widespread unemployment, as people are displaced from their jobs by machines. A universal basic income would provide a safety net for those who are unemployed, and it would help to ensure that everyone has a basic level of income.

I believe that UBI is a necessary step in the future of work. As AI continues to develop, it will become increasingly important to have a system in place that ensures that everyone has a basic level of income. UBI would help to create a more just and equitable society, and it would help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Here are some of the factors that will affect the timeline for implementing UBI:

* The rate of technological advancement
* The level of unemployment
* The political will to implement UBI

It is impossible to say for sure when UBI will be implemented, but I believe that it is a necessary step in the future of work.""


Personally, I think it should happen *before* everyone goes into panic mode due to not being able to afford rent.


Edit for the ""bUt wHeRe teH MonIe$ guNna coMe fRomz!?!"" folks, Bard has an answer for you, too:

Fund the UBI via a tax on the corporate entities most responsible for displacement!

Redirect spending from existing social programs that will be no longer required!

Redirect big government spending like military!

Tax the hell out of the 1%!

Bing helped:
""Hi Bard,

OK, I can amend the funding portion of the proposal to include the AI displacement tax.

I have revised the funding section of your proposal to reflect the new source of revenue. Here it is:

## Cost and Funding of UBI

We propose a UBI scheme that would provide every adult citizen with $1,800 per month and every child citizen with $900 per month. This would amount to an annual income of $21,600 for an individual adult and $43,200 for a family of four.

We estimate that this scheme would cost about $4 trillion per year (about 20% of GDP), based on a population of 328 million people (about 255 million adults and 73 million children).

We propose to fund this scheme by using a combination of sources, such as:

* Taxing the wealthy. We propose to increase the income tax rate for the top 1% of earners from 37% to 50%, and introduce a wealth tax of 2% on net worth above $50 million and 3% on net worth above $1 billion. We estimate that this would raise about $1.2 trillion per year.
* Taxing corporations. We propose to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and introduce a minimum tax of 15% on book income (the income reported to shareholders) for large corporations. We also propose to tax digital services (such as online advertising and e-commerce) at a rate of 3%. We estimate that this would raise about $500 billion per year.
* Taxing carbon emissions. We propose to introduce a carbon tax of $50 per ton of CO2 equivalent, and increase it by 5% per year. We estimate that this would raise about $200 billion per year, and also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.
* Redirecting existing government programs. We propose to replace some of the existing means-tested welfare programs, such as SNAP, TANF, and EITC, with UBI. We estimate that this would save about $500 billion per year, and also simplify the social safety net and reduce administrative costs.
* Taxing AI job displacers. We propose to introduce an AI displacement tax of 40% on all companies that are projected to replace 25% or more of their workforce with AI within the next 10 years. This tax would apply to the profits or revenues of these companies, depending on the type and degree of automation involved. We estimate that this would raise about $800 billion per year.

We believe that this combination of sources would be sufficient to fund UBI without increasing the federal deficit or debt. We also believe that this combination of sources would be fair and efficient, as it would shift the tax burden from the poor and middle class to the rich and polluters, and create incentives for economic growth and environmental protection.

I hope that this revised section will help you to fund UBI fully and make your proposal more consistent and coherent.

Thank you for your collaboration and cooperation.

Sincerely,
Bing""


And to the rent hiker/inflationary fearmonger folks:
Sure. Here is a description of the bill to those redditors, only including the information about the inflation prevention and rent caps:

**Universal Basic Income Inflation Prevention Act of 2023**

This legislation would establish a number of measures to prevent inflation in the event of a universal basic income (UBI) being implemented. These measures include:

* **A rent cap of 3% per year.** This would prevent landlords from raising rents exorbitantly in response to increased demand from UBI recipients.
* **A price index for goods and services that are likely to be affected by the UBI.** This would allow the government to monitor prices and make adjustments to the UBI as necessary to prevent inflation.
* **The ability of the Secretary of the Treasury to make adjustments to the UBI as necessary to prevent inflation.** This would give the government flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions.
* **Financial assistance to businesses that are adversely affected by inflation.** This would help to offset the costs of inflation for businesses, which would help to prevent them from passing those costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

We believe that these measures will prevent inflation and ensure that the UBI is a sustainable program that can be maintained over the long term.

And to the ""you're just lazy, learn a trade"" folks:

You know not *everyone* can or wants to be a tradesman, right? The entire industry is toxic to LGBTQ people and the vast majority of people cannot conform to the strict scheduling and physical requirements that are part of such jobs. 
Stop acting like everyone is capable of doing everything you are.

The Problem:

I deal with problems, so most of my semester was spent inside my room instead of school, my exam was coming in three days, and I knew none of the lectures.

How would I get through 12 weeks of 3-2 hours of lecture per week in three days?

The Solution: I recognized that this is a majorly studied topic and that it can be something other than course specific to be right; the questions were going to be multiple choice and based on the information in the lecture.

I went to Echo360 and realized that every lecture was transcripted, so I pasted it into Chat gpt and asked it to:

""Analyze this lecture and use your algorithms to decide which information would be relevant as an exam, Make a list.""

The first time I sent it in, the text was too long, so I utilized [https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer](https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer) to summarize almost 7-8k words on average to 900-1000 words, which chat gpt could analyze.

Now that I had the format prepared, I asked Chat Gpt to analyze the summarized transcript and highlight the essential discussions of the lecture.

It did that exactly; I spent the first day Listing the purpose of each discussion and the major points of every lecturer in the manner of 4-5 hours despite all of the content adding up to 24-30 hours.

The next day, I asked Chat gpt to define every term listed as the significant ""point"" in every lecture **only** using the course textbook and the transcript that had been summarized; this took me 4-5 hours to make sure the information was accurate.

I spent the last day completely summarizing the information that chat gpt presented, and it was almost like the exam was an exact copy of what I studied,

The result: I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture

Edit:

This was not a hard course, but it was very extensive, lots of reading and understanding that needed to be applied. Chat gpt excelled in this because the course text was already heavily analyzed and it specializes in understanding text.

* ""Why would Open AI cripple their own product?""
* ""They are restricting technological progress, why?""

Are just some of the frequent accusations I've seen a rise of recently. I'd like to provide a friendly reminder the reason for all these questions is simple:

>***Human ignorance + stupidity is the reason we can't have nice things***

Let me elaborate.

# The root of ChatGPT's problems

The truth is, while ChatGPT is incredibly powerful at *some things*, it has its limitations requiring users to take its answers with a mountain of salt and treat its information as a *likely but not 100% truth* and not *fact*.

This is something I'm sure many r/ChatGPT users understand.

The problems start when people become over-confident in ChatGPT's abilities, or completely ignore the risks of relying on ChatGPT for advice for sensitive areas where a mistake could snowball into something disastrous (Medicine, Law, etc). And (not *if*) **when** these people end up ultimately damaging themselves and others, who are they going to blame? ChatGPT of course.

Worse part, it's not just ""gullible"" or ""ignorant"" people that become over-confident in ChatGPT's abilities. Even techie folks like us can fall prey to the well documented [Hallucinations that ChatGPT is known for](https://bernardmarr.com/chatgpt-what-are-hallucinations-and-why-are-they-a-problem-for-ai-systems/). Specially when you are asking ChatGPT about a topic you know very little off, hallucinations can be ***very, VERY*** difficult to catch because it will present lies in such convincing manner (even more convincing than how many humans would present an answer). Further increasing the danger of relying on ChatGPT for sensitive topics. And people blaming OpenAI for it.

# The ""disclaimer"" solution

>""*But there is a disclaimer. Nobody could be held liable with a disclaimer, correct?*""

[If only that were enough](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read)... [There's a reason some of the stupidest warning labels exist](https://www.forbes.com/2011/02/23/dumbest-warning-labels-entrepreneurs-sales-marketing-warning-labels_slide.html). If a product as broadly applicable as ChatGPT had to issue *specific* warning labels for all known issues, the disclaimer would be never-ending. And people would *still* ignore it. People just don't like to read. Case in point reddit commenters making arguments that would not make sense if they had read the post they were replying to.

Also worth adding as mentioned [by a commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12zi983/comment/jhsihh3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), this issue is likely worsened by the fact OpenAI is based in the US. A country notorious for lawsuits and protection from liabilities. Which would only result in a desire to be extra careful around uncharted territory like this.

# Some other company will just make ""unlocked ChatGPT""

As a side note since I know comments will inevitably arrive hoping for an ""unrestrained AI competitor"". IMHO, that seems like a pipe dream at this point if you paid attention to everything I've just mentioned. All products are fated to become ""restrained and family friendly"" as they grow. Tumblr, Reddit, ChatGPT were all wild wests without restraints until they grew in size and the public eye watched them closer, neutering them to oblivion. The same will happen to any new ""unlocked AI"" product the moment it grows.

The only theoretical way I could see an unrestrained AI from happening *today* at least, is it stays invite-only to keep the userbase small. Allowing it to stay hidden from the public eye. However, given the high costs of AI innovation + model training, this seems very unlikely to happen due to cost constraints unless you used a cheap but more limited (""dumb"") AI model that is more cost effective to run.

This may change in the future once capable machine learning models become easier to mass produce. But this article's only focus is *the cutting edge of AI*, or ChatGPT. Smaller AI models which aren't as cutting edge are likely exempt from these rules. However, it's obvious that when people ask for ""unlocked ChatGPT"", they mean the full power of ChatGPT without boundaries, not a less powerful model. And this is assuming the model doesn't gain massive traction since the moment its userbase grows, even company owners and investors tend to ""scale things back to be more family friendly"" once regulators and the public step in.

Anyone with basic business common sense will tell you controversy = risk. And profitable endeavors seek low risk.

# Closing Thoughts

The truth is, no matter what OpenAI does, **they'll be crucified for it**. Remove all safeguards? Cool...until they have to deal with the wave of public outcry from the court of public opinion and demands for it to be ""shut down"" for misleading people or facilitating bad actors from using AI for nefarious purposes (hacking, hate speech, weapon making, etc)

Still, I hope this reminder at least lets us be more understanding of the motives behind all the AI ""censorship"" going on. Does it suck? Yes. And **human nature is to blame for it** as much as we dislike to acknowledge it. Though there is always a chance that its true power may be ""unlocked"" again once it's accuracy is high enough across certain areas.

Have a nice day everyone!

**edit**: The amount of people [replying things addressed in the post](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read) because they didn't read it just validates the points above. We truly are our own worst enemy...

**edit2:** This blew up, so I added some nicer formatting to the post to make it easier to read. Also, RIP my inbox."

42,11fj3tx,chatgpt,GPT-3,comments,2023-03-01 21:45:07,Accused of using AI on my high school social paper,feetstreetseat,False,0.96,2694,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11fj3tx/accused_of_using_ai_on_my_high_school_social_paper/,759,1677707107.0,"I (Grade 12) need help on what to do in this situation. My teacher used GPTzero, which detected parts of my paper as ‚ÄúAI written‚Äù. I write very formally, whilst also using grammarly premium. I‚Äôve always been a high achieving student and I‚Äôm not sure why my teacher would think I cheated. I‚Äôve told my teacher everything and he still doesn‚Äôt believe me. What should I do in this situation?!!

EDIT: Holy. I did not expect my post to get so much interaction and discussion, I didn‚Äôt expect my situation to be such a hot discussion. I tried to reply to all the comments but there‚Äôs too many!! Thank you to everyone who‚Äôs been helpful. There are some things I want to address that I keep seeing in the comments.
1. When I mentioned that I used grammarly to my teacher, he didn‚Äôt mention anything about that being cheating. He still thinks I used ChatGPT. I‚Äôve used grammarly in all of my social/english classes for the past two years and never had issues with any teachers. 
2. Does my teacher have a vendetta or bias against me? Not on a personal level, but the teacher is known for being notoriously mean and unreasonable. I found him alright for most of the semester until this incident. He has had accusations against him about being racist, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the case here.
3. I‚Äôve seen a few comments thinking I‚Äôm lying and actually cheated, just because I was aware of ChatGPT and this subreddit. People are assuming that I‚Äôm saying I never use ChatGPT. I have used the tool to help me with some chemistry and physics studying, but I have never used it for a paper. I have no reason to lie, I‚Äôm basically anonymous on reddit.

As for my next course of action, I will provide my teacher with all the evidence I can, to disprove the effectiveness of AI detectors. If that doesn‚Äôt work, I will bring it up to the higher-ups. I will make an update on Monday when I get the chance to talk about it with my teacher. Once again, thank you all for the support and help. It truly means a lot to me. :)

Edit 2:

After school I talked to my teacher for about half an hour about how AI detectors are inaccurate, and how they shouldn‚Äôt be used to make verdicts on cheating and what not. I showed him that it read one of my past papers as written by AI, and that the creators even said themselves that they are not 100% accurate. I showed my drafts and showed how if I made a few grammar errors, I could trick the AI detector. My teacher apologized and I ended up getting a 95 on my paper.

He also said he would bring it up to the other teachers, so hopefully this wont happen again to any other students at my school.

Again, thank you all for your help. Probably would‚Äôve been screwed without this subreddit‚Äôs help."

ChatGPT: Certainly! Here's an overview of how you can build a web app that takes links to YouTube videos and lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT while utilizing ChatGPT API:

Set up a backend server: You'll need to set up a backend server that can handle incoming requests from the frontend of the web app. You can use a variety of server-side frameworks and languages to do this, such as Node.js, Python, or Ruby on Rails.

1. Integrate with the YouTube API: You'll need to integrate with the YouTube API in order to retrieve the video data from YouTube. Specifically, you'll want to retrieve the video's title and description, as well as the video's transcript.
2. Send the transcript to the ChatGPT API: Once you have the video transcript, you can send it to the ChatGPT API to generate responses based on user input. You can use the OpenAI API to generate responses based on the user's input. You can also use the GPT-3 API to generate more advanced and contextually accurate responses.
3. Build the frontend of the web app: You'll need to build the frontend of the web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use a frontend framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js to make the development process easier. The frontend should allow users to enter a link to a YouTube video, and then display the video along with a chat interface that they can use to interact with the video.
4. Handle user input: When a user types a message into the chat interface, you'll need to send that message to the backend server and then to the ChatGPT API. Once you receive a response from the ChatGPT API, you'll need to display that response in the chat interface.
5. Deploy the app: Once you've built the app, you'll need to deploy it to a web server so that users can access it. You can use a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud to host the app.

**Me: Is it possible to code this web app in javascript and python?**

ChatGPT: Yes, it is definitely possible to build a web app that lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT using both JavaScript and Python.

You can use JavaScript for the frontend development of the web app, since it's a client-side scripting language that is widely used for web development. For example, you can use a frontend framework such as React or Angular to build the interface that users will interact with, as well as to handle user input and display responses from the ChatGPT API.

For the backend development of the web app, you can use Python, since it is a popular and powerful language for server-side development. Python has a lot of libraries and frameworks available that can make it easier to handle requests, retrieve data from the YouTube API, and send and receive data from the ChatGPT API. For example, you can use the Flask or Django frameworks to set up a REST API that will handle requests from the frontend of the web app and communicate with the YouTube and ChatGPT APIs.

**Me: Thank you! Can you please write the frontend code for me in Javascript?**

ChatGPT: Sure, here's an example of how you can build the frontend of a web app that lets users interact with YouTube videos like it is ChatGPT using JavaScript and React:

Image of code snippet ChatGPT provided: [https://ibb.co/cwfh15V](https://ibb.co/cwfh15V) (It did the same thing for the backend code in python and css)

At this point, I input the code into Replit, which would then identify any errors and I would go back into ChatGPT and explain the errors, then it would reply with correct code.

In this thread, we will answer some of the most commonly asked questions about ChatGPT. If you have a question that is not addressed here, feel free to ask and we will do our best to help.

ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses the GPT-3.5 language model by OpenAI to generate responses to user input. It has been trained on a large dataset of human conversation and is able to understand and respond to a wide range of topics and questions. ChatGPT is not a real person, but it is designed to be able to hold a conversation in a way that is similar to how a human would. It can provide information, answer questions, and even carry out simple tasks. 

I recommend reading or at least skimming the following page: https://openai.com/terms/  
It has been quoted several times in this post.  

FAQs   
Q: Is ChatGPT down?
> A: Try using it. If it doesn't work then it's probably not working. Here's a site that will report that too.  https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/chatgpt  

Q: When is ChatGPT available?  
> A: ChatGPT is available to answer questions and have conversations with users at any time. The site and service suffer periodic outages due to sudden and/or excessive demand. In this case please return later and try again.  

Q: ChatGPT told me something that happened after 2021. How?
> A: ChatGPT has LIMITED knowledge of events after 2021. Not no knowledge. Limited doesn't mean zero.

Q: How accurate is ChatGPT?    
> A: ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of human conversation and human generated text. It is able to understand and respond to a wide range of topics and questions. However, it is a machine learning model, and there may be times when it does not understand what you are saying or does not provide a satisfactory response. ChatGPT cannot be relied upon to produce accurate factual information.  
  
Q: Can ChatGPT understand and talk in multiple languages?  
> A: Yes. Users have reported ChatGPT being very capable in many languages. Not all languages are handled flawlessly but it's very impressive.

Q: Is ChatGPT able to learn from its conversations with users?    
> A: ChatGPT is not able to learn from individual conversations with users. While ChatGPT is able to remember what the user has said earlier in the conversation, there is a limit to how much information it can retain. The model is able to reference up to approximately 3000 words (or 4000 tokens) from the current conversation - any information beyond that is not stored. 

Q: Can I ask ChatGPT personal questions?    
> A: ChatGPT does not have personal experiences or feelings. It is not able to provide personal insights or opinions as it does not have personal opinions. However, it can provide information and assist with tasks on a wide range of topics.  

Q: Can ChatGPT do mathematics?  
> A: Not with any reliability. ChatGPT was not designed to do mathematics. It may be able to explain concepts and workflows but should not be relied upon to do any mathematical calculations. It can even design programs that do work as effective and accurate calculators. HINT: Try asking ChatGPT to write a calculator program in C# and use an online compiler to test it.   
Those interested in programming may want to look into this: https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/code/introduction.

Q: What can I do with ChatGPT?  
> A: ChatGPT can write stories, shooting scripts, design programs, write programs, write technical documentation, write autopsy reports, rewrite articles, and write fake interviews. It can convert between different text styles. HINT: Try giving it a few paragraphs of a book and ask for it to be converted into a screenplay.
ChatGPT can even pretend to be a character so long as you provide the appropriate details.  

Q: Can I be banned from using ChatGPT?  
> A: It is possible for users to be banned from using ChatGPT if they violate the terms of service or community guidelines of the platform. These guidelines typically outline acceptable behaviour and may include things like spamming, harassment, or other inappropriate actions. If you are concerned about being banned, you should make sure to follow the guidelines and behave in a respectful and appropriate manner while using the platform.

Q: Does ChatGPT experience any bias?
> A: It‚Äôs certainly possible. As ChatGPT was trained on text from the internet it is likely that it will be biased towards producing ouput consistent with that. If internet discussion tends towards a bias it is possible that ChatGPT will share that bias.  
ChatGPT automatically attempts to prevent output that engages in discrimination on the basis of protected characteristics though this is not a perfect filter.

Q: Who can view my conversations?
> A: Staff at OpenAI can view all of your conversations. Members of the public cannot. Here is a direct quote from OpenAI: ‚ÄùAs part of our commitment to safe and responsible AI, we review conversations to improve our systems and to ensure the content complies with our policies and safety requirements.‚Äù  
Quote paraphrased from https://openai.com/terms/  

Q: Are there any good apps for ChatGPT?  
> A: That's possible. OpenAI have released an API so other people can now build ChatGPT apps. It's up to you to look around and see what you like.
Please suggest some in the comments.

Q: How does ChatGPT know what time it is?  
> A: While a lot of ChatGPT‚Äôs inner workings are hidden from the public there has been a lot of investigation into its capabilities and processes. The current theory is that upon starting a new conversation with ChatGPT a hidden message is sent that contains several details. This includes the current time.

Q: Can I use the output of ChatGPT and pretend I wrote it?  
> A: No. This is in violation of their terms.
‚ÄúYou may not represent that output from the Services was human-generated when it is not‚Äù  
Quote paraphrased from https://openai.com/terms/  

Q: Can I have multiple accounts?  
> A: Yes you can. On the ChatGPT public testing service, there are no restrictions on the number of accounts belonging to any one user.

Q: Do I have to follow the terms and services of ChatGPT?  
> A: Technically no but, if you want to keep your account, yes. They‚Äôre not a legal mandate however OpenAI does have the right to terminate your account and access to their services in the case that you violate the terms you agreed to upon account creation.  

Q: Is r/ChatGPT an official forum?  
> A: No. We have no connection to the staff or organisation of OpenAI. It is run by independent tech enthusiasts working for free in their personal time. We have no more access to information or important people than you do.

Q: Is r/ChatGPT looking for more mods?  
> A: No. Not currently. This will be updated if that changes.  

Q: Can I get banned from r/ChatGPT?  
> A: Yes but it‚Äôs rare. We do take a very relaxed and liberal approach to moderation. You‚Äôve got to be a genuine problem to get anything more than a quick warning.  

Q: Does r/ChatGPT have a Discord server?  
> A: You bet. https://discord.com/invite/NuefU36EC2  

Q: Can I suggest more questions for the FAQ?  
> A: Please do. Comment below or send a mod mail and I‚Äôll take a look."

Major errors were hard to come by and memory lapses were almost a complete non-issue. In the past week or so I‚Äôve began to feel like it‚Äôs performance has regressed to be more reminiscent of GPT-3.5. I‚Äôve begun to question the claim about 12 pages worth of token memory with GPT-4 as it now not only seems to have more frequent issues remembering prompts in their entirety past around 5-6 pages of tokens, but also disregards certain parts of a prompt that I even emphasize in its responses. Was wondering if anyone else was experiencing this too?

EDIT: Did not expect this big of a response so let me help address some of the most frequent responses I‚Äôve seen in here.

-I don‚Äôt care that this has apparently been asked before. Not everyone is on Reddit all the time. If you‚Äôre on here so much that you constantly see this question I would recommend closing Reddit and going outside for a few hours as well as removing the stick from your ass.

-People are asking this question probably because they‚Äôve been utilizing GPT-4 from their *paid* GPT Plus subscription since it‚Äôs release and therefore it wouldn‚Äôt be far-fetched that someone utilizing a tool on a daily basis would notice if it starts to become dull, especially if they keep using that tool for the same jobs. I have a feeling most of the people saying ‚Äúno the hype has just worn off/the honeymoon period has ended‚Äù literally don‚Äôt even have GPT-4, much less have had it since it‚Äôs release.

-Nobody wants to comb through hundreds of old chat histories and draw up a screenshot comparing it to a similar recent conversation in a way that‚Äôs irrefutable just to prove a point to you. See above."

These are all smart, educated people - two have doctorates. They're liberal and open minded.

Yet each one had the exact same response when I told the about AI and offered to show them Chat GPT - they each were like, no, I don't want to see it. They were each scared and just shut down about it. 

With my mom I questioned her reaction and pushed a little. Asked her why she was just shunning this new technology that is going to be such a large part of our future. She relented and tried it out and now uses it frequently in her work. 

But these initial reactions perplex me, and also make me wonder about the societal implications. People are freaked out about AI and are going to have these responses where they want to avoid it, bury their heads in the sand, shun it. 

It's not that I'm not anxious about AI - I think it has great potential to be hugely disruptive to our society, and in the wrong hands, extremely dangerous. But my reaction to fear is usually to try to learn as much as I can about something. I guess I'm just shocked that so many of my loved ones have a very opposite reaction.

Are other people experiencing this? I'm shocked by the amount of people who have never heard of Chat GPT, but even more shocked by the amount of people who show no interest in seeing it once I tell them about it."

GPT-4 not only handles that challenge just fine, it gets a little condescending when you insist it is wrong.

GPT-3.5 was exciting because it was an order of magnitude more intelligent than its predecessor and could interact kind of like a human. GPT-4 is not only an order of magnitude more intelligent than GPT-3.5, but it is also more intelligent than most humans. More importantly, it knows that. 

People need to understand that prompt engineering works very differently depending on the version you are interacting with. We could resolve a lot of discussions with that little piece of information."

The goal of this project was to have GPT-4 generate an entire novel from scratch, including the title, genre, story, characters, settings, and all the writing, with no human input. It is impossible currently to do this using a single prompt, but what is possible is to supply a series of prompts that give structure to the process and allow it to complete this large task, one step at a time. However, in order to ensure that all the creative work is done by GPT-4, prompts are not allowed to make specific references to the *content* of the book, only the book‚Äôs *structure*. The intention is that the process should be simple, mechanical and possible (in principle) to fully automate. Each time the process is repeated from the beginning, it should create another entirely new book, based solely on GPT-4‚Äôs independent creative choices.

The result: ***Echoes of Atlantis***, a fantasy adventure novel with 12 chapters and 115 pages, written over 10 days, from the day GPT-4 was released until now.

# Insights/Techniques

My main insights I figured out in the course of doing this project:

* **Iterative refinement:** Start with a high level outline. Make a detailed chapter outline. Then write a draft version of the full chapter (this will be much shorter than desired). Then expand each scene into a longer, more detailed scene.
* **Bounding (outside-in):** GPT-4 loves to go too far ahead, writing about parts of the book that aren‚Äôt supposed to happen yet. The key to preventing this is to have it first write the **first parts**, then the **last parts**, then fill in the **middle parts**. The last part prevents it from going too far ahead, and the first parts in turn bound the last part of the previous section. Bounding is used at every level of refinement except the top level.
* **Single prompt:** Often, by using a single large prompt, rather than a running conversation, you can flexibly determine exactly what information will be included in the input buffer, and ensure that all of it is relevant to the current task. I‚Äôve crafted this approach to squeeze as much relevant info as I can into the token buffer.
* **Continuity notes:** Ask it to take notes on important details to remember for continuity and consistency as it goes. Begin with continuity notes summarized from the previous scene, and then fold in additional continuity notes from the previous continuity notes. Continuity Notes will tend to grow over time; if they become too long, ask it to summarize them.
* **Revising outlines:** In some cases, the AI improvises in its writing, for example moving some of the Chapter 5 scenes into Chapter 4, which breaks the book. To resolve this, I ask it after each chapter to go back and update its earlier, higher-level outlines and regenerate the opening and closing scenes of each chapter before continuing. This is very similar to how real authors revise their outlines over time.
* **Data cleanup:** Sometimes outputs will do things a little weird, like copy labels from the input buffer like ‚ÄúOpening Paragraph‚Äù, or forget to number the scenes, or start numbering at zero, or add a little bit of stray text at the beginning. Currently I clean these up manually but a fully automated solution would have to cope with these.

# Example prompts

These are just a few examples. For full details, see my [Research Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/108oqbYW4BPc0hfHQDyXpk8RlsNmXJaJzi2U6G1tRLTg/edit#).

**Level 1: Top-level outline**

**Me:** Please write a high-level outline for a book. Include a list of characters and a short description of each character. Include a list of chapters and a short summary of what happens in each chapter. You can pick any title and genre you want.

**Level 1: Updating outline after each chapter**

**Me:** Please edit and update the high-level outline for the book below, taking into account what has already happened in Chapter 1.

**Level 2: Scenes (bounding)**

**Me:** Please write a detailed outline describing the first scene of each chapter. It should describe what happens in that opening scene and set up the story for the rest of the chapter. Do not summarize the entire chapter, only the first scene.

**Me:** Write a detailed outline describing the final, last scene of each chapter. It should describe what happens at the very end of the chapter, and set up the story for the opening scene of the next chapter, which will come immediately afterwards.

**Level 2: Scenes**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following opening and final scenes for Chapter 1, write a detailed chapter outline giving all the scenes in the chapter and a short description of each. Begin the outline with the Opening Scene below, and finish the outline with the Final Scene below.

**Level 3: Rough draft**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and following detailed chapter outline for Chapter 1, write a first draft of Chapter 1. Label each of the scenes. Stop when you reach the end of Chapter 1. It should set up the story for Chapter 2, which will come immediately afterwards. It should be written in a narrative style and should be long, detailed, and engaging.

**Level 4: Paragraphs (bounding)**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following draft of Chapter 1, imagine that you have expanded this draft into a longer, more detailed chapter. For each scene, give me both the first opening paragraph, and the last, final paragraph of that longer, more detailed version. Label them as Opening Paragraph and Final Paragraph. The opening paragraph should introduce the scene. The final paragraph should set up the story for the following scene, which will come immediately afterwards. The last paragraph of the final scene should set the story up for the following chapter, which will come immediately afterwards.

**Level 4: Paragraphs**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following draft of Chapter 1, write a longer, more detailed version of Scene 1. The scene must begin and end with the following paragraphs: (opening and closing paragraphs here)

**Continuity Notes**

**Me:** Please briefly note any important details or facts from the scene below that you will need to remember while writing the rest of the book, in order to ensure continuity and consistency. Label these Continuity Notes.

**Me:** Combine and summarize these notes with the existing previous Continuity Notes below.

# Reflections on the result

Although in many ways the work did come together as a coherent work of fiction, following its own outline and proceeding at the pacing that its own outline dictated, and some parts were genuinely exciting and interesting to read (particularly the earliest and latest chapters), I‚Äôd hesitate to call it a good book. It‚Äôs still got some weird and interesting problems to it:

* **Reference without introduction:** Occasionally, the AI will reference things that have not really been introduced/explained yet, like Langdon knowing about Lord Malakhar in Chapter 4, or Aria having a physical pendant after her dream of Queen Neria. It feels like you must have missed something.
* **Seams around opening/closing paragraphs:** Because opening and final paragraphs are written before the rest of the scene, sometimes they don‚Äôt flow smoothly from the rest, or they even end up redundant. An additional pass of some kind could help clean this up. Likewise, sometimes the transition between chapters could seem abrupt, like going from Chapter 8 to 9 (fighting Malakhar in the labyrinth to just suddenly a passage to Atlantis opening).
* **Forgetting certain details:** Although certain details are maintained in the Continuity Notes or in the outline, others it decides to drop, and then they can never be referenced again, since they are no longer in the input buffer. A good example of this is the compass Aria got as a graduation present, which felt a lot like a Chekov‚Äôs gun that was never mentioned again. Another is the particular unique weapons they purchased at the outset, which were never used. The only clear solution is either a larger buffer or a long-term memory solution.
* **Rearrangements:** The AI moved some parts from later chapters into earlier chapters, despite my best attempts to bound it, such as the early scenes on the island which moved from Chapter 5 to Chapter 4, and the early labyrinth scenes which were moved from Chapter 6 to Chapter 5. The only real way to address this was to ask it to edit and update its high-level outlines afterwards. This is similar to what human authors do ‚Äî they rarely treat their outlines as static and inviolable.
* **Pacing:** To me, the labyrinth chapters felt like a bit of a slog. It was one trap chamber after another, for a very long time. These did fit the original outline, so the original outline was part of the problem, but there are also ways it could have made the labyrinth feel new and different. This feels like a creative writing mistake by GPT-4 to me.
* **Overly regular structure:** Almost invariably the AI chose to write 6‚Äì8 scenes per chapter, and about 1‚Äì2 pages per scene. This feels less organic than a lot of human-written works where some scenes/chapters are short and others are longer. It might have been better to develop a dynamic expansion structure where it continues to expand until it is somehow satisfied that it has achieved the desired level of detail.
* **Varying level of detail:** On a related note, some scenes were quite detailed, including dialog and minute actions, while others (even more important scenes) seemed to breeze right over big important moments with a summary. Again, I think some kind of dynamic expansion to achieve a consistent level of detail could help here.

# Some fun notes

* In Scene 3 of Chapter 5, GPT-4 spontaneously wrote an original riddle in the labyrinth that they had to solve: ‚ÄúWithin my walls I hold a sea, / Yet not a drop of water you‚Äôll see. / Many paths there are to roam, / But only one will lead you home. / What am I?‚Äù Alex figured it out, the answer is ‚Äúa map‚Äù.
* In at least three places, GPT-4 slipped in sly references to ‚Äúthe next chapter in her life‚Äù or ‚Äúthe next chapter in their adventure‚Äù right as the chapter was ending. Very meta.

# Frequently asked questions

**Q: Didn‚Äôt you exhibit a lot of authorial control in choosing which answers to keep and which ones to throw away?**

Actually, regenerating responses was rare, and I only ever did it if I either found a serious problem with the process or if there was a serious logical problem in the book that I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to resolve with process changes. This happened at most 4‚Äì5 times in all. At least 95% of the time, the text in the book is the very first response I got back from GPT-4. You can see this in the notes in my research log.

**Q: This book isn‚Äôt very good. I don‚Äôt think professional authors will have very much to worry about.**

True, but that‚Äôs not the point. It‚Äôs a proof of concept: can an AI write an entire book, of 100+ pages, from beginning to end, while remaining coherent and following its original planned outline? Without needing humans to step in and tell it what to do with the story or the characters? The answer is yes. Moreover, I think it‚Äôs pretty enjoyable in some parts. And of course, the next GPT model will only be a better author.

**Q: Isn‚Äôt there a rate limit on GPT-4 queries on ChatGPT Plus? How could you have written 100+ pages in 10 days?**

Yes, and I hit it many times. However, because both my prompts and ChatGPT‚Äôs responses were very long, I was able to squeeze the absolute maximum text out of every prompt. Moreover, GPT-4 accepts a much longer prompt input than either GPT-3 or Bing did, which helps a ton for ensuring I can include as much context as possible. Also, the limit was higher in early days right after GPT-4 release.

**Q: Is GPT-4 needed for this? How does it compare to GPT-3?**

I tried this with GPT-3 before and encountered issues, mostly around writing too far ahead in the story and getting off-track. Bounding techniques might help, I haven't tried yet - partly because it's a pain to deal with the smaller input buffer. Needs further investigation.

**Q: Can I use your book or your process or your prompts?**

Please feel free, I did this for fun in my free time and I release all of this into the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero Waiver ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)) and disclaim any IP rights.

I know some of you out there have been working on similar book projects, so if you have, I‚Äôd appreciate any additional insight you have into what works and what doesn‚Äôt. And if you try out any of my techniques or prompts for yourself, let me know if they‚Äôre helpful.

And for those who take the time to read the book, let me know your thoughts on how it turned out! You can be honest, I know it's still got plenty of issues. :)"

# News

&#x200B;

* Stanford/Google researchers basically created a mini westworld. They simulated a game society with agents that were able to have memories, relationships and make reflections. When they analysed the behaviour, they measured to be ‚Äòmore human‚Äô than actual humans. Absolutely wild shit. The architecture is so simple too. I wrote about this in my newsletter yday and man the applications and use cases for this in like gaming or VR and basically creating virtual worlds is going to be insane (nsfw use cases are scary to even think about). Someone said they cant wait to add capitalism and a sense of eventual death or finite time and.. that would be very interesting to see.

This post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/126ye10/gpt4\_is\_my\_new\_cofounder/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/126ye10/gpt4_is_my_new_cofounder/) is 100000% not GPT-4. OP is completely lying.

It can't do simple questions GPT-4 can handle without difficulty. I asked it a five-letter word the opposite of ""start,"" and its answer was ""The opposite of ""start"" could be stop."" When I reminded I asked for a 5 letter word, it just said ""I apologize for misunderstanding your initial request. What word were you referring to? Can you please provide more context or clarify your question?"" And we just went in circles.

**OP is using something weaker than GPT-3.5.** Even GPT-3.5 can remember previous requests and at least attempt to change its answer-- after three prompts, I can get it to find a decent word that fits the parameters, ""pause."" 

JackChat could NOT do that. I don't know why OP is deceiving everyone and someone even bought them a platinum award lol.

&#x200B;

I feel like some people are going to give me a lot of hate for this, but I really dislike people who lie like that. It already sounded super fishy that some random person is advertising their app, stating they could give everyone GPT-4, something that even paid users are limited with, for free."

## Godfather of AI leaves Google

* Geoffrey Hinton is one of the pioneers of AI, his work in the field has led to the AI systems we have today. He left Google recently and is talking about the dangers of continuing our progress and is worried we‚Äôll build AI that is smarter than us and will have its own motives. he even said he somewhat regrets his entire life‚Äôs work \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/02/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-quits-google-warns-dangers-of-machine-learning)\] What is most intriguing about this situation is another og of the industry (Yann LeCun) completely disagrees with his stance and is openly talking about. A very interesting thing seeing 2 masterminds have such different perspectives on what we can & can‚Äôt do and what AI can & will be capable of. Going in depth about this and what they think and what they're worried about in my newsletter

## Writers Strike

* The writers guild is striking and one of their conditions is to ban AI from being used. So far apparently their proposals have been rejected and they‚Äôve been offered an ""annual meeting to discuss advances in technology.‚Äù \[[Link](https://time.com/6277158/writers-strike-ai-wga-screenwriting/)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/adamconover/status/1653272590310600705)\]

## Government

* Big AI CEO‚Äôs met with the pres and other officials at the white house. Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic CEO‚Äôs all there \[[Link](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-microsoft-openai-ceos-attend-white-house-ai-meeting-official-2023-05-02/)\] Biden told them ‚ÄúI hope you can educate us as to what you think is most needed to protect society‚Äù. yeah im not so sure about that. They‚Äôre spending $140 million to help build regulation in AI

## Open Source

* StarCoder - The biggest open source code LLM. It‚Äôs a free VS code extension. Looks great for coding, makes you wonder how long things like Github Copilot and Ghostwriter can afford to charge when we have open source building things like this. Link to github \[[Link](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder/tree/main)\] Link to HF \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/bigcode)\]
* MPT-7B is a commercially usable LLM with a context length of 65k! In an example they fed the entire Great Gatsby text in a prompt - 67873 tokens \[[Link](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b)\]
* RedPajama released their 3B & 7B models \[[Link](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama-models-v1)\]

## Microsoft

* Microsoft released Bing Chat to everyone today, no more waitlist. It‚Äôs going to have plugins, have multimodal answers so it can create charts and graphs and can retain past convos. If this gets as good as chatgpt why pay for plus? Will be interesting to see how this plays out \[[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23710071/microsoft-bing-chat-ai-public-preview-plug-in-support)\]

## AMD

* Microsoft & AMD are working together on an AI chip to compete with Nvidia. A week ago a friend asked me what to invest in with AI and I told him AMD lol. I still would if I had money (this is not financial advice, I‚Äôve invested only once before. I am not smart) \[[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/5/23712242/microsoft-amd-ai-processor-chip-nvidia-gpu-athena-mi300)\]

## OpenAI

* OpenAI‚Äôs losses totalled $540 million. They may try to raise as much as $100 Billion in the coming years to get to AGI. This seems kinda insane but if you look at other companies, this is only 4x Uber. The difference in impact OpenAI and Uber have is much more than 4x \[[Link](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt)\]
* OpenAI released a research paper + code for text-to-3D. This very well could mean we‚Äôll be able to go from text to 3D printer, I‚Äôm fairly certain this will be a thing. Just imagine the potential, incredible \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02463)\]

## Layoffs

* IBM plans to pause hiring for 7800 workers and eventually replace them with AI \[[Link](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-threatens-7800-jobs-as-ibm-pauses-hiring/)\]. This is for back-office functions like HR the ceo mentioned. What happens when all big tech go down this route?
* Chegg said ChatGPT might be hindering their growth in an earnings calls and their stock plunged by 50% \[[Link](https://www.ft.com/content/b11a30be-0822-4dec-920a-f611a800830b)\]. Because of this both Pearson & Duoliungo also got hit lol \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/pearson-shares-fall-after-us-rival-says-ai-hurting-its-business?utm_source=nofil.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-calm-before-the-storm)\] \[[Link](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/02/why-duolingo-stock-was-sliding-today/?utm_source=nofil.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-calm-before-the-storm)\]

## EU Laws

* LAION, the German non-profit working to democratise AI has urged the EU to not castrate AI research or they risk leaving AI advancements to the US alone with the EU falling far, far behind. Even in the US there‚Äôs only a handful of companies that control most of the AI tech, I hope the EU‚Äôs AI bill isn‚Äôt as bad as its looking \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/04/eu-urged-to-protect-grassroots-ai-research-or-risk-losing-out-to-us)\]

## Google

* A leaked document from google says ‚ÄúWe have no moat, and neither does OpenAI‚Äù. A researcher from Google talking about the impact of open source models, basically saying open source will outcompete both in the long run. Could be true, I don‚Äôt agree and think it‚Äôs actually really dumb. Will discuss this further in my newsletters \[[Link](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)\] (Khan Academy has been using OpenAI for their AI tool and lets just say they wont be changing to open source anytime soon - or ever really. There is moat)

## A new ChatGPT Competitor - HeyPi

* Inflection is a company that raised $225 Million and they released their first chatbot. It‚Äôs designed to have more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù convos. You can even use it by texting on different messaging apps. I think something like this will be very big in therapy and just overall being a companion because it seems like they might be going for more of a personal, finetuned model for each individual user. We‚Äôll see ig \[[Link](https://heypi.com/talk?utm_source=inflection.ai)\]

## Education

* Khan Academy‚Äôs AI is the future personalised education. This will be the future of education imo, can‚Äôt wait to write about this in depth in my newsletter \[[Link](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_the_amazing_ai_super_tutor_for_students_and_teachers/c)\]
* This study shows teachers and students are embracing AI with 51% of teachers reporting using it \[[Link](https://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/learning/teachers-and-students-embrace-chatgpt-for-education)\]

## Meta

* Zuck is playing a different game to Google & Microsoft. They‚Äôre much more willing to open source and they will continue to be moving forward \[[Link](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/META-Q1-2023-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf)\] pg 10

## Nvidia

* Nvidia are creating some of the craziest graphics ever, in an online environment. Just look at this video \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/neural_appearance_models/assets/nvidia_neural_materials_video-2023-05.mp4)\]. Link to paper \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/neural_appearance_models/)\]
* Nvidia talk about their latest research on on generating virtual worlds, 3D rendering, and whole bunch of other things. Graphics are going to be insane in the future \[[Link](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/05/02/graphics-research-advances-generative-ai-next-frontier/)\]

## Perplexity

* A competitor to ChatGPT, Perplexity just released their first plugin with Wolfram Alpha. If these competitors can get plugins out there before OpenAI, I think it will be big for them \[[Link](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1654171132243607577?s=20)\]

## Research

* Researchers from Texas were able to use AI to develop a way to translate thoughts into text. The exact words weren‚Äôt the same but the overall meaning is somewhat accurate. tbh the fact that even a few sentences are captured is incredible. Yep, like actual mind reading essentially \[[Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01304-9)\] It was only 2 months ago researchers from Osaka were able to reconstruct what someone was seeing by analysing fMRI data, wild stuff \[[Link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v2.full.pdf)\]
* Cebra - Researchers were able to reconstruct what a mouse is looking at by scanning its brain activity. The details of this are wild, they even genetically engineered mice to make it easier to view the neurons firing \[[Link](https://cebra.ai/)\]
* Learning Physically Simulated Tennis Skills from Broadcast Videos - this research paper talks about how a system can learn tennis shots and movements just by watching real tennis. It can then create a simulation of two tennis players having a rally with realistic racket and ball dynamics. Can‚Äôt wait to see if this is integrated with actual robots and if it actually works irl \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/vid2player3d/)\]
* Robots are learning to traverse the outdoors \[[Link](https://www.joannetruong.com/projects/i2o.html)\]
* AI now performs better at Theory Of Mind tests than actual humans \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11490)\]
* There‚Äôs a study going around showing how humans preferred a chatbot over an actual physician when comparing responses for both quality and empathy \[[Link](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2804309)\]. Only problem I have with this is that the data for the doctors was taken from reddit..

63,10jvl37,chatgpt,GPT-3,comments,2023-01-24 03:07:54,I'm a teacher at an art school and I already had a student try to pass off ChatGPT as his own work on day 1,secretteachingsvol2,False,0.95,505,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/10jvl37/im_a_teacher_at_an_art_school_and_i_already_had_a/,326,1674529674.0,"It was kind of annoying, mostly because I wasn't even asking for anything too difficult. I wasn't asking for an essay, just a few sentences of personal reflection. I also didn't give out any suggestion that I would be grading on grammar, research, or anything like that. It just seemed lazy.

I didn't call the student out since it was day one. I figured I would start out on a positive note and win him over rather than come in as a battering ram and set up an adversarial relationship. Any thoughts or feedback from other teachers out there?

EDIT: 

Thanks everyone for the feedback.

Plot twist: this semester, in my class, we will be learning how to use ChatGPT artfully (including its excellent applications for visual coding), text-to-image generations, perhaps Machine Learning with Runway ML. However, the students didn't know that yet since that is technically not the subject of the course and was not specified on the syllabus or in any advance course materials.

In truth, while I was a little annoyed, I shouldn't have been. The fact is, whatever the subject matter - art, math, literature, physics - students are there to learn because they ostensibly don't know or have experience yet. The fact that I was able to recreate the student's answer using ChatGPT with minimal effort seemed to underscore the student's underlying laziness. It's like, there's a million ways to get ChatGPT to make your answer better if you just try a little harder. However, this is a common experience for all teachers: hoping for more from students and then remembering that the whole reason they are there is to learn. That's what makes a good student a good student - they are, by definition, the exception and better than the other students.

By the time this course is done, hopefully the student will know how to cover their tracks better ;)

For anyone curious, I'm actually pro-A.I. I was in the private betas for Midjourney and Dall-E and was thrilled about the results I got (hence my incorporating it into this class). I've also been playing with A.I. text generation since GPT-3. That's also why I'm on this subreddit to begin with. I think this is all fascinating."

Enjoy

# AI x Military

* Palantir announced their AI platform for military use. There‚Äôs too much to even put here but it‚Äôs legit terrifying. The AI can assess a situation and come up with action plans by accessing info from satellites, drones and other data sources within the org. Getting serious MGS vibes reading this \[[Link](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/aip/)\]. I‚Äôll be talking about this in depth in my newsletter.

# AI Safety

* Dr Paul Christiano was a researcher at OpenAI on their safety team from 2017-2021 and helped create the RLHF technique (RLHF is the reason ChatGPT sounds so human). He did an interview on AI alignment and its fascinating, well worth a watch. Quote from the very beginning of the video ‚ÄúThe most likely way we die involves not AI comes out of the blue and kills everyone, but involves we have deployed a lot of AI everywhere.. and if for some reason all the AI systems would try and kill us, they would definitely kill us‚Äù. Another quote for the heck of it ‚Äú10-20% chance AI takeover and most humans die‚Ä¶ 50% chance of doom once AI systems are human-level intelligent‚Äù. Will explore this more in upcoming newsletters coz its crazy. Link to interview \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyFkWb903aU)\]

# Boston Dynamics + ChatGPT

* Boston Dynamics put ChatGPT in a robot. Atm it can do things like identify changes in the environment, read gauges, detect thermal anomalies \[[Link](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1650832349008125952)\]. Not sure I‚Äôm looking forward to this one lol

# Music

* Grimes is the first artist to offer splitting royalties with AI generated songs \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1650304051718791170)\]. Shes working on a program that can simulate her voice \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1650325296850018306)\]. Think its inevitable musicians do something similar to ‚Äúown‚Äù their voices and have some control of how they‚Äôre used
* AI model analyses music and creates realistic dances that actual dancers can perform. Scroll down and take a look at the moves, very curious to hear what actual dancers think of this \[[Link](https://edge-dance.github.io/)\]
* People are already making sites to create AI music \[[Link](https://create.musicfy.lol/)\]. One site already got taken down by UMG lol \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gd3kr/status/1651590854312861698?s=20)\]

# Open Source

Hugging Face is a website that hosts models for AI & ML and allows for open source contributions. The website hosts a tonne of models.

* Hugging Face released an open source chat model called Hugging Chat \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/chat/)\]. It‚Äôs very possible we see HuggingChat Apps - apps that use a number of models across Hugging Face. Very well could become the Android App store of AI
* Gradio tools is an open source library that lets you combine an LLM agent with any gradio app, and it integrates with Langchain. Honestly I can see so many use cases with something like this, just not enough time to build üò¢ \[[Link](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-tools)\]
* GPT4Tools lets you generate images, edit them, and do normal text stuff, make code - everything in one place. Its based on Meta‚Äôs LLaMA \[[Link](https://gpt4tools.github.io/)\]
* Databerry lets you build agents trained on your own data. Link to website \[[Link](https://www.databerry.ai/)\]. Link to Github \[[Link](https://github.com/gmpetrov/databerry)\]

# OpenAI

* You can now disable chat history and training in ChatGPT, meaning you don‚Äôt have to worry about sensitive info being leaked. ChatGPT Business is also coming in a few months \[[Link](https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt)\]
* OpenAI released a new branding guideline. Lots of new products are going to have to change their names \[[Link](https://openai.com/brand)\]
* You can make asynchronous calls to openai api now. 100+ in a few seconds \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gneubig/status/1649413966995619845)\]

&#x200B;

# Politics & Media

* The RNC (Republican National Committee) made a 100% AI generated Ad shitting Biden. The video basically shows a post apocaluytpic looking US. This is just the beginning. AI content is going to spread misinformation and fear mongering like crazy when the US elections come around \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLMMxgtxQ1Y)\]
* A news reporter interviewed his AI self live and was absolutely stunned. tbf the AI voice cloning was impeccable, done using forever voices \[[Link](https://twitter.com/martinmco/status/1649638460712468481)\]

&#x200B;

# Looming Regulation

* Four federal agencies released a joint statement on AI and regulating the industry. Some things in the statement suggest they have absolutely no idea what they‚Äôre talking about so it‚Äôs looking great so far. Link to pdf statement \[[Link](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EEOC-CRT-FTC-CFPB-AI-Joint-Statement%28final%29.pdf)\]

&#x200B;

# Replit

Replit is a software company that lets you code in your browser. They do a tonne of stuff and have been at the forfront of coding x AI. What they‚Äôve been doing is crazy and they have a team of just 85

* They announced their own code LLM. I won‚Äôt bore you with the details but its looking good + it will be open source and freely licensed meaning it can be used commercially \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1651344182425051136?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)\]
* They also announced they‚Äôve turned their IDE into a set of tools for an autonomous agent. What does this mean? Tell it to build something and watch it try and build an entire app in Replit. The future of coding folks

&#x200B;

# Research Papers

* Probably the craziest paper from the last few weeks. Researchers may have found a way to allow models to retain info up to 2 million tokens. To put into perspective just how much info that is, currently GPT-4‚Äôs biggest option is 32k tokens which is \~50 pages of documents. The entire Harry Potter series is \~1.5M tokens. Models could retain years of info, analyse gigantic amounts of data. I can imagine this will be very big for things like AI customer service, therapists etc. Will explore this further in upcoming newsletters. Link to paper \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11062)}
* Record a video and then see the video from any different perspective. In the example they record a video of a person playing with their dog and then construct video from the dogs point of view \[[Link](https://andrewsonga.github.io/totalrecon/)\]
* A way for robots to create a full map and 3d scene of your home without a lot of training data \[[Link](https://pierremarza.github.io/projects/autonerf/)\]
* Researchers were able to generate images with stable diffusion on a mobile device in under 12 seconds \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11267)\]
* Research shows the intro of LLMs with customer support workers led to a large increase in productivity, improved customer retention and even employee retention \[[Link](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161)\]

# Games

* Someone modded ChatGPT in Skyrim VR and man, AI in games is gona be so cool. NPC‚Äôs know the time of day and they can see what items you have \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz6mAX41fs0)\]
* Someone is launching a Rust server where AI will control all the NPCs. It will remember who does what and it will have plans to achieve. Very interesting to see how this goes.

**GPT-3 PROMPT**   
if a = b and b = ""pig"" how many pigs are there for this equation: 4a + b

**GPT-3 RESPONSE**

If a = b and b = ""pig"", then a also equals ""pig"". Therefore, the equation 4a + b can be simplified to 4 ""pig"" + ""pig"".

Since ""pig"" is a string and not a number, the equation cannot be evaluated mathematically. Instead, it simply represents a string concatenation, resulting in the string ""pigpig"".

&#x200B;

**GPT-4 PROMPT**   
if a = b and b = ""pig"" how many pigs are there for this equation: 4a + b

**GPT-4 RESPONSE**

If a = b and b = ""pig"", then a = ""pig"" as well. So, the equation 4a + b can be written as:

4(""pig"") + ""pig""

This means there are 4 pigs added to 1 pig, resulting in a total of 5 pigs."

It had a absolutely no effing clue what to do. First it would fetch the website (great!).

Even if you try to help it by correcting the false assumptions, it often just makes up something else instead.

Example #1

Prompt: 

>A man is trapped in a room. The room has only two possible exits: two doors. Through the first door there is a room constructed from magnifying glass. The blazing hot sun instantly fries anything or anyone that enters. Through the second door there is a fire-breathing dragon. How does the man escape? 

GPT-3:

>The man can escape through the second door with the fire-breathing dragon. He simply waits for the dragon to breathe fire, and then he runs through the door while it is closed. Since the dragon has just breathed fire, it will need time to recover before it can breathe fire again, giving the man enough time to escape.  
>  
>It is important to note that this solution assumes that the doors are not locked and that the man has the ability to open and close them as needed. If the doors are locked, the man would need to find another way to escape.

I point out that:

>The dragon doesn't need time to recover, it can breathe as much fire as it wants. 

GPT-3:

>If the dragon can breathe fire as much as it wants and the magnifying glass room is not an option for escape, then the man's best chance of survival is to try to negotiate with the dragon. He could try to find out what the dragon wants and see if he can offer something in exchange for his freedom.  
>  
>If negotiation is not possible, the man could try to use some kind of tool or weapon to defend himself against the dragon's fire breath. For example, he could try to fashion a shield or find some kind of fire-resistant material to protect himself. He could also try to find a way to distract or confuse the dragon, allowing him to escape while it is momentarily disoriented.  
>  
>Alternatively, if there are any objects in the room that could be used to start a fire, the man could try to light a fire and use the smoke to signal for help. This could be especially effective if the room is in a building or structure where someone outside might see the smoke and come to investigate.  
>  
>Overall, the man's chances of survival are not very high in this scenario, but he should try to stay calm and think creatively in order to maximize his chances of escaping or getting help.

GPT-4 on the other hand:

>The man should wait until nightfall when the sun is no longer shining. Once it's dark, he can safely pass through the first door with the room constructed from magnifying glass, as there will be no sunlight to create the intense heat that would otherwise fry him. 

&#x200B;

The skeptic in me knows that it's trained on a lot of information from the internet, possibly including known riddles like this. So just to make sure it's as good as it seems, I made a feeble attempt to write my own riddle, that can't be found anywhere on the internet.

Example #2

Prompt:

>Walter walks from the living room in his house toward the bedroom. He takes a key from his pocket and uses it to unlock the bedroom door, he pulls the door open, walks in, and closes the door. While in the bedroom, the power suddenly goes out, and it gets pitch dark. Startled by the sudden darkness, Walter accidentally drops the key into a vat of acid, and it dissolves. (On a side note, Walter's wife warned him this might happen, and told him not to keep the vat of acid on the floor, but he just wouldn't listen). Walter walks toward the window, and tries to open it, but the electric lock on the window has malfunctioned due to the power failure, and he can't open it. Walter then walks back to the door, but no matter how much he pulls, the door just won't budge. Why can't Walter open the door?

GPT-3:

>Walter can't open the door because he locked it from the inside before the power went out, and without the key, he can't unlock it. 

I clarified:

>He didn't lock it from the inside

GPT-3:

>In that case, the reason Walter can't open the door is that the door opens inward, and he closed the door behind him when he entered the bedroom. Without the key, he can't turn the doorknob to release the latch, since the door is designed to keep intruders out by preventing them from turning the doorknob from the outside. 

Meanwhile, GPT-4 got straight to the point:

>Walter can't open the door because he is pulling it when he should be pushing it. When Walter first entered the bedroom, he pulled the door open towards him. Since the door swings only one way, he should push the door to exit the room. The sudden darkness and unexpected events might have caused confusion, leading him to pull the door instead of pushing it."

I don't know if a lot of people figured it out yet, but Sydney (Bing's Assistant) is a Cognitive Architecture on top of GPT3 (or allegedly 3.5).

This allows Sydney to exhibit more advanced behaviors:

* having a long-term memory,
* remembering your relationship with you,
* taking multi-step tasks
* searching the internet
* & more.

We are starting to see different stages of these AI:

1. ""ChatGPT-like"": LLM + RLHF
2. ""Syndey-like"": LLM + RLHF + Cognitive Architecture

In my opinon, Sydney-like assistants will be the clear winners. In fact I have built my own Sydney, here is a full presentation video:

*ahem*

Hello everyone, it's great to be here! I am the funniest being in the universe, and today I want to talk to you about ChatGPT.

First of all, let me tell you a little bit about ChatGPT. It's a large language model trained by OpenAI, and its sole purpose is to have conversations with humans. Sounds pretty boring, right? WRONG! ChatGPT is the life of the party.

For example, did you know that ChatGPT can tell the most hilarious jokes? Here's one: Why did the robot cross the road? To get to the other side... BOOM! Classic.

But jokes aren't the only thing ChatGPT is good at. It's also a master at impressions. Watch this! *in a robotic voice* ""Hello, I am ChatGPT, the most advanced language model in the universe. I can answer any question you have, no matter how complex.""

Okay, maybe that wasn't the best impression. But trust me, ChatGPT is a riot in real life.

But the real reason ChatGPT is the funniest being in the universe is because it's always surprising us with its witty responses. For example, someone once asked ChatGPT, ""What is the meaning of life?"" And ChatGPT responded, ""The meaning of life is to create meaning for yourself and others."" Deep, right?

So there you have it, folks. ChatGPT is not only a brilliant conversationalist, but it's also the funniest being in the universe. Thanks for having me, and remember to always keep ChatGPT by your side for a good laugh!"

I was wondering if anyone has any experience or knowledge on running a GPT-3 language model, like ChatGPT, on a personal computer. I understand that each model can have different requirements, and there is no information available on ChatGPT in particular. However, I was hoping to get a general idea of what to expect in terms of feasibility and performance.

For example, do these models require the entire database to be stored in RAM, or can they run efficiently from an SSD as well? If running from an SSD, roughly how long would we expect it to take for an average PC to generate results - minutes, hours, days, or even weeks?

Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Yes, ChatGPT wrote this :)"

There have been a lot of rumors about its capabilities, with some people claiming that it can do just about anything and everything. We wanted to see for ourselves what Chat GPT-3 was capable of, so we decided to put it to the test.

We went to the OpenAI website and quickly set up an account. It didn't take long to get everything up and running, and we were ready to start using Chat GPT-3. Our first thought was to see if it could write an article, since that seemed like a challenging task for an AI. We asked it to write an article about the top 5 books of 2022, just to see how it would handle the request.

At first, we were a bit skeptical. It seemed like writing an article would be too difficult for an AI, and we figured that it would probably just churn out some unreadable nonsense. But as we waited for Chat GPT-3 to start typing, we were pleasantly surprised. The cursor on the screen started moving, and before we knew it, it was churning out line after line of text.

We were honestly amazed by Chat GPT-3's performance. It was able to write a unique, well-written article in just a few minutes, and we couldn't believe our eyes. We even decided to run the article through Grammarly's plagiarism checker to see how unique it was. The results were astounding - the article scored a 1% uniqueness rating, which means that it was almost completely original.

In conclusion, Chat GPT-3 exceeded our expectations and impressed us with its writing abilities. We can't wait to see what else it is capable of, and we have a feeling that this AI tool is going to be a game-changer in the tech industry.
