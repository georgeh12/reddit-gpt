While these advancements can undoubtedly enhance our work, it's important to remember that data science isn't about using the most advanced or expensive tools; it's about extracting valuable insights from data to drive informed decision-making.

Data Collection and Categorization

Before diving into advanced machine learning algorithms or statistical models, we need to start with the basics: collecting and organizing data. Fortunately, both Python and R offer a wealth of libraries that make it easy to collect data from a variety of sources, including web scraping, APIs, and reading from files. Key libraries in Python include [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), while R has [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html), [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).

These libraries not only make it easy to collect data but also to clean and structure it for analysis. With just a few lines of code, you can filter, sort, and transform data into a format that's ready for exploration and modeling.

Data Analysis and Visualization

Once your data is collected and organized, the next step is to analyze and visualize it. Both Python and R excel in this area, providing a wide range of libraries and packages for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Python's pandas, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) libraries offer powerful functionality for data manipulation, while [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [plotly](https://plotly.com/) provide versatile tools for creating visualizations. Similarly, in R, you can use dplyr, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) for data manipulation, and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [lattice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html), and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for visualization. These packages enable you to create insightful visualizations and perform statistical analyses without relying on expensive or proprietary software.

Modeling and Prediction

Finally, when it comes to building models and making predictions, Python and R have a plethora of options available. Libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)in Python, or [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/), [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf), and [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)in R, provide powerful machine learning algorithms and statistical models that can be applied to a wide range of problems. What's more, these libraries are open-source and have extensive documentation and community support, making it easy to learn and apply new techniques without needing specialized training or expensive software licenses.

Simplicity is key, embrace it and you'll learn a lot faster than trying to glean insights from some poorly trained AI model.

[Number Of Parameters GPT-3 vs. GPT-4](https://preview.redd.it/t6m0epzlgyca1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5972941053f833e76fd3a5009fc68a61f9e5406)

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

For the past 5 years I've been locked into this job with a workvisa, but I got my greencard approved a couple weeks ago and finally have some more freedom and am looking into making a complete career switch.

I don't have the best people skills (although it improved managing 20+ employees for 5 years), but have good technical and math skills. I grew up in Belgium where every year in high school I made it to the national Math Olympics final. I got a Bachelor of Science degree in Bioscience Engineering and a Masters of Science degree in Management, Economics and Consumer Sciences. I always felt I was learning things faster than others, was always best in class, but spent the majority of my time helping my parents on their farm until I moved to the US.

While managing this dairy in the US, I did a lot of little things on the side.

* I played around with some crypto, was arbitraging bets on the US elections on different crypto betting websites and protocols (eg. receiving odds of 1.9x for Biden to win, while receiving odds above 3x for Trump to win election)
* Buying and selling large amounts of crypto for cash for a 10-15% mark-up
* Buying bitcoin miners from China after their crypto ban and selling them locally for a profit
* I saw publicly traded bitcoin mining companies were way overvalued, but shorting them is risky since it's hard to predict what will happen to the bitcoin-price so I started to run efficient bitcoin miners in a facility with cheap electricity, while shorting stocks like RIOT to eliminate the risk of the bitcoinprice going up. I made a copy of a % of RIOT for a 10th of what their stock was worth and shorted them at the same time.
* Buying SPY at the stock market while shorting mSPY (mirrored SPY) on mirror protocol (DeFi - Decentralized Finance) with aUST (acnhored UST) as collateral, leveraging this up many times to get yields around +100% APY on USD (by taking insurance for a UST-depeg through Unslashed (who did pay us out through a Kleros-court case). I lost 300k $ on this after making 600k $ with it because of SPY pricing jumping up by 4% to come back down 4% a bleep of a second afterwards on the actual stock market (dark pool after hours). [see here](https://forum.mirror.finance/t/liquidations-caused-by-unrepresentative-oracle-pricing-of-mspy-on-jan-3-2022/2569)

All of this together made some good amount of money, but right now I'm trying to figure out what to do with our future. The biggest reason I want to quit my current job is that I have a wife and 3 little kids who I don't see enough. I want to spend more time with them, but it's not working out in my current position. I also feel like I want to use my technical/logical/math skills more, but after all this time it's hard to figure out what to do exactly and how to even start on getting there. 

We are thinking of either:

* Running our own small business, but we can't seem to figure out what exactly.
* Software Engineering
* Data Scientist/AI/ML
* Other managerial jobs I could get, although I don't think I ""love"" managing people
* ...

&#x200B;

I'm open to any advice, on positions, on who to talk to, on which path to take. Thanks in advance!"

I  am also looking for new, up and coming tech, and definitely not afraid to try new things!**

IDE: **VSCode with the Jupyter Notebook Extension**. What I like about it is that I can view data structures like series/dataframes in a table format by clicking the variable in the Jupyter: Variables pane at the bottom. I started with plain vanilla jupyter notebooks from Anaconda so this was pretty nice. I have seen demos that **Jupyter Lab** has something like this, so if anyone has used both VSCode's notebooks and used Lab, your input would be appreciated. I hear good things about **PyCharm and Spyder**. Some people also use **Google Collab, DataSpell, and DeepNote** but I don't know enough about it. I did play around with DeepNote, and it was very cool but I didn't feel compelled to switch (and you have to pay for it!). 

Tools:

* A code helper: A few months back I was googling everything and I would've listed **Stackoverflow**. I might actually use that occasionally, but these days I use **ChatGPT** and **Bing AI**. For more current info or news-based I'll use Bing AI since it uses live search results, and for information that is knowledge based I might use ChatGPT. ChatGPT saves conversations so it's great for exploring topics in depth and referencing that conversation later. For those who have used both, maybe you know what I'm talking about and can provide a better explanation as to which is better for what purpose.
* Software: **Excel** is an obvious one. For instance, if I have a huge dataset and I just want to delete out columns that I don't need with Ctrl+click to select, it's easier and quicker than copy + pasting or typing out each of the string column names I want to ""df.drop()"". Excel is great for quick and simple stuff. Some software I have been learning about are I guess what I would consider as no- or low-code data analytics platforms, such as **Alteryx, KNIME, and Orange**. These software let you practically run an entire ETL pipeline. I believe Alteryx and KNIME are the gold-standard in this category, and Orange is a ""lite"" version of the two and is available in Anaconda. I think these are pretty cool, and I personally haven't found a huge use case for them since I've been chugging away in my notebooks with Python, but I can see the value. Would love for someone to chime in on these tools and how they compare to manually doing stuff in code, especially for large datasets.
* Version Control: This is where I'm primarily lacking, but I know that **Github** is the go-to. I don't use this but I know that a ton of people do. I don't even know where to start to be honest. I usually just create a new .ipynb file for each analysis or phase of an ETL pipeline haha. I'm also not too aware of what other innovative tools for version control exist.
* Python Libraries: Besides the obvious stuff like Pandas/NumPy, MatplotLib/Seaborn, and your popular ML libraries, I've recently found out about this library called **Polars**. It's basically a Rust version of Pandas, and it's super powerful. Some operations that I've run, that would've taken hours with Pandas, took me minutes. But I've been hearing that **Pandas 2.0** which will be released some time this month, has been looking at using PyArrow dtypes (if I recall correctly) and the speed is comparable to Polars. I mean these two are FAST. Another contender is **DuckDB** but I think the new Pandas and Polars are still faster. I mostly use Pandas but if there is some heavy lifting, I'll swap the dataframe to a polars one with a quick function, run it with polars, then back to pandas.

Anyway, that's just some things I can immediately think of. Looking forward to your suggestions! Bonus points for anything new and innovative. Cheers.

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

The only thing you do is put dictionaries with a name and text key, then search your embeddings instance. We return anything you stick in there with it too for your programming pleasure - think dates, page numbers, file names, whatever.

You can just... Build chat bots that are pretty smart like this for next to nothing by reading in your docs or whatever. It's cheap and incredibly effective. I know next to nothing about how to preprocess data for this thing, I've tried different sizes of chunks, lines, sentences and haven't found a one size fits all solution (other than more gpt to summarize) but - just try it, it's cheap as hell and there's so much you can do. Like the rest of the current state of gpt - it just kinda works. Start with one to five sentences (or lines for code) and experiment!

For you proper data scientists (nerds!) - you can just get the numpy array out and do regular embeddings stuff with it. If you do, I'd love to hear about it! Clustering, classification, etc are suddenly super easy, and the raw data is stored in json so you can upload it to something better when you're ready.

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

We recently published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11856) introducing this novel method and an [open-source](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) Python implementation that is easy-to-use for all data types (image, text, tabular, audio, etc). For data scientists, we've made a quick [Jupyter tutorial](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples/blob/master/active_learning_multiannotator/active_learning.ipynb) to run ActiveLab on your own data. For ML researchers, we've made all of our [benchmarking code](https://github.com/cleanlab/multiannotator-benchmarks/tree/main/active_learning_benchmarks) available for reproducibility so you can see for yourself how effective ActiveLab is in practice.

Labeled data is key to train models, but data annotators often make mistakes. One can collect multiple annotations per datapoint to get a more reliable consensus label, but this is expensive! To train the best ML model with the least data labeling, a key question is: **which new data should I label, or which of my current labels should be checked again?**

https://preview.redd.it/txcqiokmndla1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=d202b8ffabd1174d81616bcbcddea5eea9c93203

ActiveLab automatically answers this question for you, allowing you to train the most accurate ML model via a smaller number of total annotations than required to reach similar accuracy with popular active learning methods.  ActiveLab is highly practical — it runs quickly and works with: any type of ML model, batch settings where many examples are (re)labeled before model retraining, and settings where multiple annotators can label an example (or just one annotator).

I am starting with the speed detection using a a dataset I found by commaai on GitHub. Thing is, there was never any discussion about how to preprocess video to get it into an RNN. We discussed how RNN's work but not much preprocessing. Are there any keras preprocessing layers anyone would suggest? Speed detection is not really an image classification problem. I have at least split the video into an array of frame data using openCV already. This capstone seems very advanced compared to the instruction given. 

P.s. I only took the class because the state offered to pay for it and it sounded interesting. After it started they informed me that I I don't pass the final I will have to pay it all back. So, let's just say there is strong monetary motivation to figure this out."

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Many of us in the data science and ML space work with **multi-label data**, where the image or text is tagged with multiple labels. Often these datasets contain **frequent label errors** and/or **missing tags** (check what we found below in the CelebA dataset) that make it hard to train highly accurate ML models. Support for multi-label data was one of the top features requested — so we [added it](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/multilabel_classification.html), [benchmarked it](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/multilabel/), and published all of the [research](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/multilabel/).

[Find errors and missing labels in multi-label datasets.](https://preview.redd.it/tn0m9lg8mx2a1.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=80d4d09a24b6929894a5ce994042f491a6b8f544)

We are excited to share this newest research on algorithms to automatically find label errors in multi-label classification datasets. Image/document tagging represents important instances of **multi-label classification** tasks, where each example can belong to multiple (or none) of K possible classes. Because annotating such data requires many decisions for each example, often multi-label classification datasets contain tons of label errors, which harm the performance of ML models.

We’ve open-sourced our algorithms in the [recent release of cleanlab v2.2](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab/releases/tag/v2.2.0). All you need to do to use them is write one line of open-source code via [cleanlab.filter.find\_label\_issues](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/multilabel_classification.html).

    from cleanlab.filter import find_label_issues
    
    ranked_label_issues = find_label_issues(

        return_indices_ranked_by=""self_confidence"",
    )
    # labels: list of lists of (multiple) labels of each example
    # pred_probs: predicted class probabilities from any trained classifier

Running the new `find_label_issues()`function on the [CelebA](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) image tagging dataset reveals around **30,000 mislabeled images**! Check out a few of them in the blog post!

My internship experience is limited to front end development but as I was accruing credits towards my statistics major over the past year and a half and taking a course on machine learning, I've decided that I want to go into the field of data science. Unfortunately I don't have any internship experience in the field but after alot of consideration, a career in data science seems to be what I have the most interest in.

Through my coursework and projects I've had alot of exposure to python and data and ml frameworks, namely numpy and pyTorch. I also have experience in SQL and backend query languages.  

My question is, what should I focus on doing to make myself a more appealing candidate to get into the field of data science? Are there any certificate programs like the TensorFlow developer certificate that would help in me getting a job in this field? I should note that I had my fair share of personal issues in college and that my gpa is a 2.7 which really concerns me about my chances.

I apologize if this question is too open-ended or lacks basic research on my part, I've been struggling on what career I wanna go into and just recently decided I want to orient myself towards data science. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Also, as a side if you can touch a little bit on what job security looks like in the field I would greatly appreciate it. I've been paying attention to the openAI language model and like I'm sure many others, was frightened by what it could do. I understand there's no way it could replace a data scientist in it's current state however who knows what it can do in future iterations? How likely is it that large language models like chatGPT will either replace or displace a large percentage of data scientists in the field?"

As a person whose only notions of basketball come from Space Jam, this surprised me. Wasn't the guy the best out there? How could someone who's best in his field ruin it? After hearing the argument out though, I began to understand what the video was really getting at: to them, Michael Jordan had ruined the field BECAUSE he was so good. A sport that was once full of diverse personalities and strategies then turned into multiple teams trying to produce their own Michael Jordan copycat with copycat moves and copycat strategies.

I'm not well versed enough in basketball to know how right or wrong that guy was. But this concept that something could ruin an entire field simply by being too good stuck with me. And all these years later, I consistently think about it while doing my job as a Data Scientist. And the more GPT-X and ChatGPT advance, the more this concept haunts me.

I've been working in this field for 5 years. During the first 4 years, the job was exciting. Every new problem required extensive research on my part: looking for papers, datasets, implementations, implementing my own stuff, experimenting, comparing the results... That was the biggest part of my job. Yeah I still had to do some software engineering stuff here and there, but I felt like I had a well defined and specialized role at my company. Even in the NLP field, the variety of technologies I had to work with was a lot of fun: sometimes I used RNNs, sometimes embedding based similarity functions, sometimes more classic approaches, and then towards the end it was transformer after transformer, but at least I still had to finetune them myself.

Over the past few months and years, this has started to change, however. GPT-1 and 2 were promising, but were more of a proof of concept than anything realistically usable. But with GPT3's and ChatGPT's latest performance, it feels like NLP is becoming more and more standardized. I wouldn't call it a solved field, far from it. But, sadly, unless you work for a big tech company,  I think the days of exploratory research-type work in the NLP field are over.

Even in academia, the latest NLP papers I've seen come out of prestigious universities went from actual engineering/mathematical advances to ""Look, if you ""engineer"" the prompt like this, it works better sometimes!""

And now, with the exploding popularity of ChatGPT, any random lambda would come to the conclusion that if you need to use AI, ChatGPT is the answer.

Now, some of you may already be thinking ""but hold on, with my finetuned transformer I get a 1% increase in accuracy over out-of-the-box GPT-3!"". The thing is: even if you can, it doesn't really matter. I really doubt the sales team of your company is gonna pay much attention to your pleas to give you 6 months to work on a product rather than 6 minutes. Because yes, that's the increase in productivity we're dealing with: What took me months a few years ago only takes minutes now. The range of problems I can apply NLP too has also increased, as out-of-the-box GPT-3 works well enough not to require a dataset for more ""general"" tasks. And the results are either comparable or even better.

In the span of a year, NLP went from my favorite ML field to one I never see myself working in again if given the choice. And while a lot of non NLP fields are, for now, untouched by the exploding popularity of the GPT family, I'm afraid that what happened to the NLP field will be replicated in other fields, and that in a few years, only super specialized issues won't have a solution somewhere in the form of a ridiculously big model accessible via an API key provided by a big tech company. And even if GPT3 was open source, the sheer size of it makes it close to impossible to realistically train for anything less than the biggest of tech companies out there. Even finetuning it would be a challenge.

I'm not saying the job of data scientist will disappear, in fact, I'd say it will be asked more than ever since boomers who don't understand what the title actually implies will want some in their company. But we won't be doing nearly as much actual data sciency stuff as we did in the past. Instead we'll have to become even bigger software engineer/data analyst/DevOps/project manager hybrids than we already were. The only exception is for people who either work in big tech companies or on very specialized problems that require an in-house model.

It's not that much of a problem for people who like the roles I listed above. But for people like me, whose enjoyment came out of the exploratory side of the job, I believe the future to be bleak."

For the past 5 years I've been locked into this job with a workvisa, but I got my greencard approved a couple weeks ago and finally have some more freedom and am looking into making a complete career switch.

I don't have the best people skills (although it improved managing 20+ employees for 5 years), but have good technical and math skills. I grew up in Belgium where every year in high school I made it to the national Math Olympics final. I got a Bachelor of Science degree in Bioscience Engineering and a Masters of Science degree in Management, Economics and Consumer Sciences. I always felt I was learning things faster than others, was always best in class, but spent the majority of my time helping my parents on their farm until I moved to the US.

While managing this dairy in the US, I did a lot of little things on the side.

* I played around with some crypto, was arbitraging bets on the US elections on different crypto betting websites and protocols (eg. receiving odds of 1.9x for Biden to win, while receiving odds above 3x for Trump to win election)
* Buying and selling large amounts of crypto for cash for a 10-15% mark-up
* Buying bitcoin miners from China after their crypto ban and selling them locally for a profit
* I saw publicly traded bitcoin mining companies were way overvalued, but shorting them is risky since it's hard to predict what will happen to the bitcoin-price so I started to run efficient bitcoin miners in a facility with cheap electricity, while shorting stocks like RIOT to eliminate the risk of the bitcoinprice going up. I made a copy of a % of RIOT for a 10th of what their stock was worth and shorted them at the same time.
* Buying SPY at the stock market while shorting mSPY (mirrored SPY) on mirror protocol (DeFi - Decentralized Finance) with aUST (acnhored UST) as collateral, leveraging this up many times to get yields around +100% APY on USD (by taking insurance for a UST-depeg through Unslashed (who did pay us out through a Kleros-court case). I lost 300k $ on this after making 600k $ with it because of SPY pricing jumping up by 4% to come back down 4% a bleep of a second afterwards on the actual stock market (dark pool after hours). [see here](https://forum.mirror.finance/t/liquidations-caused-by-unrepresentative-oracle-pricing-of-mspy-on-jan-3-2022/2569)

All of this together made some good amount of money, but right now I'm trying to figure out what to do with our future. The biggest reason I want to quit my current job is that I have a wife and 3 little kids who I don't see enough. I want to spend more time with them, but it's not working out in my current position. I also feel like I want to use my technical/logical/math skills more, but after all this time it's hard to figure out what to do exactly and how to even start on getting there. 

We are thinking of either:

* Running our own small business, but we can't seem to figure out what exactly.
* Software Engineering
* Data Scientist/AI/ML
* Other managerial jobs I could get, although I don't think I ""love"" managing people
* ...

I'm open to any advice, on positions, on who to talk to, on which path to take. Thanks in advance!"

While these advancements can undoubtedly enhance our work, it's important to remember that data science isn't about using the most advanced or expensive tools; it's about extracting valuable insights from data to drive informed decision-making.

Data Collection and Categorization

Before diving into advanced machine learning algorithms or statistical models, we need to start with the basics: collecting and organizing data. Fortunately, both Python and R offer a wealth of libraries that make it easy to collect data from a variety of sources, including web scraping, APIs, and reading from files. Key libraries in Python include [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), while R has [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html), [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).

These libraries not only make it easy to collect data but also to clean and structure it for analysis. With just a few lines of code, you can filter, sort, and transform data into a format that's ready for exploration and modeling.

Data Analysis and Visualization

Once your data is collected and organized, the next step is to analyze and visualize it. Both Python and R excel in this area, providing a wide range of libraries and packages for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Python's pandas, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) libraries offer powerful functionality for data manipulation, while [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [plotly](https://plotly.com/) provide versatile tools for creating visualizations. Similarly, in R, you can use dplyr, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) for data manipulation, and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [lattice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html), and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for visualization. These packages enable you to create insightful visualizations and perform statistical analyses without relying on expensive or proprietary software.

Modeling and Prediction

Finally, when it comes to building models and making predictions, Python and R have a plethora of options available. Libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)in Python, or [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/), [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf), and [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)in R, provide powerful machine learning algorithms and statistical models that can be applied to a wide range of problems. What's more, these libraries are open-source and have extensive documentation and community support, making it easy to learn and apply new techniques without needing specialized training or expensive software licenses.

Simplicity is key, embrace it and you'll learn a lot faster than trying to glean insights from some poorly trained AI model.

First of all, machine learning is a bit useless if everybody just leverage openAI (or Google) LLM. I mean why would companies ever need any other AI if they can all just pay google or microsoft to do the AI-related jobs for them?

And even when it comes to data reasoning, AI will be able to do that job much faster as compared to data scientists. If you check azure openAI landing page, they literally mentioned code generation and data reasoning as their selling points.

Now, I think I want to concentrate on data science, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, I am interested in prediction and online social network analysis. I suspect my main interests will be in the area of AI/ML.

Eventually, after I finish my refreshing of MIT single-variable calculus and MIT multivariable calculus relearning, I will be taking MIT Linear Algebra (3 months); MIT Python programming (3 months); MIT Micromaster program in statistics and data science audit (18 months); MIT Micromasters in statistics and data science for certificate (12 months; shorter because 2nd time); Machine learning by Stanford (3 months); MIT AI Products and Services (2 months);  graph theory (3 months); and Harvard or University of Canterbury text analytics (3 months).I believe the above path will allow me to freelance as a data scientist, ML engineer and/or AI engineer. As I learn and complete projects, I will build my GitHub portfolio for potential contracts. I also hope to volunteer at several non-profits to help and to learn. Specifically, climate crisis prediction, whistleblower retaliation analysis and mental health.

I am a simple man, but I excelled in mathematics and mathematical programming--96% average-in MIT single variable, multivariable and differential equation calculus, which got me recognized by the MIT mathematics department, and top 12.97% at Project Euler mathematical programming on an international scale. I also earned a B+ in MIT classical mechanics. I did quite well in chemical engineering and finished with a B+ average even though I doubled up on my chemical engineering and engineering courses. Not because I love pain, but because I was accepted into the professional school of chemical engineering from a community college, and I did not have the sophomore chemical engineering and engineering courses finished. It was quite difficult, but it was worth it as chemical engineering is a unique thought process that has opened doors for me.

I also did well as a chemical engineer in the pharmaceutical industry. I optimized 25 processes, and was awarded three vice president's awards from vice president of research, development and validation. In total, I worked for 5 corporations and the the government.

If I succeed with my coursework, will I be competitive? I have read, in r/datascience, that some believe coding is more important than mathematics. Meanwhile, MIT, Berkeley, Princeton, Harvard and Northwestern University, as a few examples, concentrate on mathematics for a strong foundation in the above mentioned subjects. Princeton says that one should take as much probability as possible, and Berkeley emphasized that an excellent foundation in math is important. What is your opinion?"

I  am also looking for new, up and coming tech, and definitely not afraid to try new things!**

IDE: **VSCode with the Jupyter Notebook Extension**. What I like about it is that I can view data structures like series/dataframes in a table format by clicking the variable in the Jupyter: Variables pane at the bottom. I started with plain vanilla jupyter notebooks from Anaconda so this was pretty nice. I have seen demos that **Jupyter Lab** has something like this, so if anyone has used both VSCode's notebooks and used Lab, your input would be appreciated. I hear good things about **PyCharm and Spyder**. Some people also use **Google Collab, DataSpell, and DeepNote** but I don't know enough about it. I did play around with DeepNote, and it was very cool but I didn't feel compelled to switch (and you have to pay for it!). 

Tools:

* A code helper: A few months back I was googling everything and I would've listed **Stackoverflow**. I might actually use that occasionally, but these days I use **ChatGPT** and **Bing AI**. For more current info or news-based I'll use Bing AI since it uses live search results, and for information that is knowledge based I might use ChatGPT. ChatGPT saves conversations so it's great for exploring topics in depth and referencing that conversation later. For those who have used both, maybe you know what I'm talking about and can provide a better explanation as to which is better for what purpose.
* Software: **Excel** is an obvious one. For instance, if I have a huge dataset and I just want to delete out columns that I don't need with Ctrl+click to select, it's easier and quicker than copy + pasting or typing out each of the string column names I want to ""df.drop()"". Excel is great for quick and simple stuff. Some software I have been learning about are I guess what I would consider as no- or low-code data analytics platforms, such as **Alteryx, KNIME, and Orange**. These software let you practically run an entire ETL pipeline. I believe Alteryx and KNIME are the gold-standard in this category, and Orange is a ""lite"" version of the two and is available in Anaconda. I think these are pretty cool, and I personally haven't found a huge use case for them since I've been chugging away in my notebooks with Python, but I can see the value. Would love for someone to chime in on these tools and how they compare to manually doing stuff in code, especially for large datasets.
* Version Control: This is where I'm primarily lacking, but I know that **Github** is the go-to. I don't use this but I know that a ton of people do. I don't even know where to start to be honest. I usually just create a new .ipynb file for each analysis or phase of an ETL pipeline haha. I'm also not too aware of what other innovative tools for version control exist.
* Python Libraries: Besides the obvious stuff like Pandas/NumPy, MatplotLib/Seaborn, and your popular ML libraries, I've recently found out about this library called **Polars**. It's basically a Rust version of Pandas, and it's super powerful. Some operations that I've run, that would've taken hours with Pandas, took me minutes. But I've been hearing that **Pandas 2.0** which will be released some time this month, has been looking at using PyArrow dtypes (if I recall correctly) and the speed is comparable to Polars. I mean these two are FAST. Another contender is **DuckDB** but I think the new Pandas and Polars are still faster. I mostly use Pandas but if there is some heavy lifting, I'll swap the dataframe to a polars one with a quick function, run it with polars, then back to pandas.

Anyway, that's just some things I can immediately think of. Looking forward to your suggestions! Bonus points for anything new and innovative. Cheers.

[Number Of Parameters GPT-3 vs. GPT-4](https://preview.redd.it/t6m0epzlgyca1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5972941053f833e76fd3a5009fc68a61f9e5406)

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

It's basically a generic interface to try embeddings, and it's less than a hundred lines of code. Built this so you can just authenticate and test without having to fuss with numpy, pinecone, etc.

The only thing you do is put dictionaries with a name and text key, then search your embeddings instance. We return anything you stick in there with it too for your programming pleasure - think dates, page numbers, file names, whatever.

You can just... Build chat bots that are pretty smart like this for next to nothing by reading in your docs or whatever. It's cheap and incredibly effective. I know next to nothing about how to preprocess data for this thing, I've tried different sizes of chunks, lines, sentences and haven't found a one size fits all solution (other than more gpt to summarize) but - just try it, it's cheap as hell and there's so much you can do. Like the rest of the current state of gpt - it just kinda works. Start with one to five sentences (or lines for code) and experiment!

For you proper data scientists (nerds!) - you can just get the numpy array out and do regular embeddings stuff with it. If you do, I'd love to hear about it! Clustering, classification, etc are suddenly super easy, and the raw data is stored in json so you can upload it to something better when you're ready.

I know it's small, but little abstractions make life better. Anything we can do to lower the barrier to experimentation is worth doing. Hope it helps someone!"

So, I went through all the lectures and examples provided for Central Michigan's ML and AI boot camp  which, although much more expensive than a Udemy class, are not as high quality. The classes are hosted on Ed2go. Now, for a capstone project, to pass the class, I need to design models to take video input of from driver POV and overlay on an output video the current speed of the vehicle, boxes around the signs with sign classification, and road edges / centerline lines. I am starting with the speed detection using a a dataset I found by commaai on GitHub. Thing is, there was never any discussion about how to preprocess video to get it into an RNN. We discussed how RNN's work but not much preprocessing. Are there any keras preprocessing layers anyone would suggest? Speed detection is not really an image classification problem. I have at least split the video into an array of frame data using openCV already. This capstone seems very advanced compared to the instruction given. 

P.s. I only took the class because the state offered to pay for it and it sounded interesting. After it started they informed me that I I don't pass the final I will have to pay it all back. So, let's just say there is strong monetary motivation to figure this out."

I'm looking at four laptop for DS. Not really interested in gaming, just the gpu, good cpu and massive ram. So that kind of brings me to the gaming laptop segment. 

**Main uses:**

- Data preprocessing, Prototyping cuda, rapids ai for accelerating classical data science and machine learning, DL inferencing, building conda enabled containers, 3D modeling/rendering and simulations using python, NLP, openCV, pytorch



1. Thinkpad p16:  4200$/3900$ (64 vs 32 gb ram)

64gb/32gb ddr5, i9 12900hx, rtx a4500 16gb vram, 1 TB, 3480 vs 2400, 230W power adapter 



2. Thinkpad p1 gen5:  3900$

32gb ddr5, i9 12900h vpro, rtx 3080ti 16gb vram, 1 TB, 2560 vs 1600, 230W power adapter



3. Asus Proart studiobook: 2999$

I saw a TED talk from one of the OpenAI founders. You can see it here: https://youtu.be/C_78DM8fG6E

It's mind-blowing. He shows some new features that are coming soon to ChatGPT. He asks for a meal and uses the DALL-E integration to get an image of it. He even gets a shopping order put together on Instakart. He just needs to click and the food will be delivered to his house. 

The most impressive thing was the data analysis where he uploaded a CSV and the LLM figured out what the columns referred to on its own and then asked for plots and a prediction etc. The spat out Python code that he could dive into as well. 

It sounds like it could do data cleaning, preprocessing and modelling fairly easily. It would take some iterations, but if you have it the right direction, it would speed up the process 10x or more. 

I think this will basically simplify work for data scientists but will also enable ordinary folks with no quant backgrounds to do sophisticated analysis. 

I'm no longer a data scientist and work in product management. But if I were still in data science, I'd focus on my ability to help people self serve. I think the role will split to expert data scientists who build and productionise ML models and analytics enablers who help people get more out of the tools.

These solution typically have some modules related to data science out of the box. Take for example Kinaxis, which has its Planning.AI within its ecosystem. Others like Blue Yonder, SAP and O9 also feature some readily built-in data science solutions to tackle supply chain problems. 

Sure other industries also have their own popular proprietary solutions bought from the market.

However, for supply chain specifically, I kinda have the impression that the usage of open source solutions like R/Python/Julia is lesser known. Python has PuLP, R has ROI package and Julia has JuliaOpt. But choosing which one over the other is not always clear. You have more resources online debating the merits of R vs Python, say for deep learning with concrete examples of how they are being used in the industry. 

I just joined the supply chain industry and there is a lot of focus on getting certified on these paid solutions (Kinaxis, Blue Yonder, O9, etc). While the opportunity to learn the proprietary systems is great, I hope to ensure my previously acquired skills in R/Python remain relevant in this industry. For example, previously I used R forecast package to perform demand forecasting. This was because the client was mainly using Excel tool and the SAP system has very basic forecasting feature. 

But now it seems that this proprietary systems are gettibg more sophisticated with the supply chain offering that you can run some level of AI within their integrated systems.

So how is R/Python being used alongside the proprietary solution in the supply chain industry?"

[Sam Altman Might Have Just Pulled Off The Coup Of The Decade](https://preview.redd.it/35vtxrwnekea1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=a61dd557e1d00c96448c429c9f9bb78516205a6f)

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

We all have heard an uncountable amount of predictions about how AI will ***terk err jerbs!***

However, here we have a proper study on the topic from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania. They investigate how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) could automate tasks across different occupations \[1\].

Although I’m going to discuss how the study comes with a set of “imperfections”, the findings still make me really excited. The findings suggest that machine learning is going to deliver some serious productivity gains.

People in the data science world fought tooth and nail for years to squeeze some value out of incomplete data sets from scattered sources while hand-holding people on their way toward a data-driven organization. At the same time, the media was flooded with predictions of omniscient AI right around the corner.

*Let’s dive in and take an* exciting glimpse into the future of labor markets\*!\*

# What They Did

The study looks at all US occupations. It breaks them down into tasks and assesses the possible level of for each task. They use that to estimate how much automation is possible for a given occupation.

The researchers used the [O\*NET database,](https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html) which is an occupation database specifically for the U.S. market. It lists 1,016 occupations along with its standardized descriptions of tasks.

The researchers annotated each task once manually and once using GPT-4. Thereby, each task was labeled as either somewhat (<50%) or significantly (>50%) automatable through LLMs. In their judgment, they considered both the direct “exposure” of a task to GPT as well as to a secondary GPT-powered system, e.g. LLMs integrated with image generation systems.

To reiterate, a higher “exposure” means that an occupation is more likely to get automated.

Lastly, they enriched the occupation data with wages and demographic information. This was used to determine whether e. g. high or low-paying jobs are at higher risk to be automated.

So far so good. This all sounds pretty decent. Sure, there is a lot of qualitative judgment going into their data acquisition process. However, we gotta cut them some slag. These kinds of studies always struggle to get any hard data and so far they did a good job.

However, there are a few obvious things to criticize. But before we get to that let’s look at their results.

# Key Findings

The study finds that 80% of the US workforce, across all industries, could have at least some tasks affected. Even more significantly, 19% of occupations are expected to have at least half of their tasks significantly automated!

Furthermore, they find that higher levels of automation exposure are associated with:

* Programming and writing skills
* Higher wages (contrary to previous research!)
* Higher levels of education (Bachelor’s and up)

Lower levels of exposure are associated with:

* Science and critical thinking skills
* Manual work and tasks that might potentially be done using physical robots

This is somewhat unsurprising. We of course know that LLMs will likely not increase productivity in the plumbing business. However, their findings underline again how different this wave is. In the past, simple and repetitive tasks fell prey to automation.

*This time it’s the suits!*

If we took this study at face value, many of us could start thinking about life as full-time pensioners.

But not so fast! This, like all the other studies on the topic, has a number of flaws.

# Necessary Criticism

First, let’s address the elephant in the room!

OpenAI co-authored the study. They have a vested interest in the hype around AI, both for commercial and regulatory reasons. Even if the external researchers performed their work with the utmost thoroughness and integrity, which I am sure they did, the involvement of OpenAI could have introduced an unconscious bias.

*But there’s more!*

The occupation database contains over 1000 occupations broken down into tasks. Neither GPT-4 nor the human labelers can possibly have a complete understanding of all the tasks across all occupations. Hence, their judgment about how much a certain task can be automated has to be rather hand-wavy in many cases.

Flaws in the data also arise from the GPT-based labeling itself.

The internet is flooded with countless sensationalist articles about how AI will replace jobs. It is hard to gauge whether this actually causes GPT models to be more optimistic when it comes to their own impact on society. However, it is possible and should not be neglected.

The authors do also not really distinguish between labor-augmenting and labor-displacing effects and it is hard to know what “affected by” or “exposed to LLMs” actually means. Will people be replaced or will they just be able to do more?

Last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation. For instance ""making someone feel cared for"" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list.

# Take-Away And Implications

GPT models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so.

Nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10%.

As the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased. Time will tell whether foundational LLMs, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of APIs will be having the biggest impact.

In any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world. At the same time, change rarely happens without pain. I strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change. All in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future.

Efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future. Well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks.

Jokes aside!

What an exciting time for science and humanity!

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

The only thing you do is put dictionaries with a name and text key, then search your embeddings instance. We return anything you stick in there with it too for your programming pleasure - think dates, page numbers, file names, whatever.

You can just... Build chat bots that are pretty smart like this for next to nothing by reading in your docs or whatever. It's cheap and incredibly effective. I know next to nothing about how to preprocess data for this thing, I've tried different sizes of chunks, lines, sentences and haven't found a one size fits all solution (other than more gpt to summarize) but - just try it, it's cheap as hell and there's so much you can do. Like the rest of the current state of gpt - it just kinda works. Start with one to five sentences (or lines for code) and experiment!

For you proper data scientists (nerds!) - you can just get the numpy array out and do regular embeddings stuff with it. If you do, I'd love to hear about it! Clustering, classification, etc are suddenly super easy, and the raw data is stored in json so you can upload it to something better when you're ready.

I know it's small, but little abstractions make life better. Anything we can do to lower the barrier to experimentation is worth doing. Hope it helps someone!"

The most impressive thing was the data analysis where he uploaded a CSV and the LLM figured out what the columns referred to on its own and then asked for plots and a prediction etc. The spat out Python code that he could dive into as well. 

It sounds like it could do data cleaning, preprocessing and modelling fairly easily. It would take some iterations, but if you have it the right direction, it would speed up the process 10x or more. 

I think this will basically simplify work for data scientists but will also enable ordinary folks with no quant backgrounds to do sophisticated analysis. 

I'm no longer a data scientist and work in product management. But if I were still in data science, I'd focus on my ability to help people self serve. I think the role will split to expert data scientists who build and productionise ML models and analytics enablers who help people get more out of the tools. 

What do you think? Is this a threat to data scientists? Or is it a productivity booster that will only make life better?"

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

My internship experience is limited to front end development but as I was accruing credits towards my statistics major over the past year and a half and taking a course on machine learning, I've decided that I want to go into the field of data science. Unfortunately I don't have any internship experience in the field but after alot of consideration, a career in data science seems to be what I have the most interest in.

Through my coursework and projects I've had alot of exposure to python and data and ml frameworks, namely numpy and pyTorch. I also have experience in SQL and backend query languages.  

My question is, what should I focus on doing to make myself a more appealing candidate to get into the field of data science? Are there any certificate programs like the TensorFlow developer certificate that would help in me getting a job in this field? I should note that I had my fair share of personal issues in college and that my gpa is a 2.7 which really concerns me about my chances.

I apologize if this question is too open-ended or lacks basic research on my part, I've been struggling on what career I wanna go into and just recently decided I want to orient myself towards data science. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Also, as a side if you can touch a little bit on what job security looks like in the field I would greatly appreciate it. I've been paying attention to the openAI language model and like I'm sure many others, was frightened by what it could do. I understand there's no way it could replace a data scientist in it's current state however who knows what it can do in future iterations? How likely is it that large language models like chatGPT will either replace or displace a large percentage of data scientists in the field?"
