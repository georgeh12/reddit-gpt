*OpenAI may have tested on the training data. Besides, human benchmarks are meaningless for bots.*

 **Problem 1: training data contamination**

To benchmark GPT-4’s coding ability, OpenAI evaluated it on problems from Codeforces, a website that hosts coding competitions. Surprisingly, Horace He pointed out that GPT-4 solved 10/10 pre-2021 problems and 0/10 recent problems in the easy category. The training data cutoff for GPT-4 is September 2021. This strongly suggests that the model is able to memorize solutions from its training set — or at least partly memorize them, enough that it can fill in what it can’t recall.

As further evidence for this hypothesis, we tested it on Codeforces problems from different times in 2021. We found that it could regularly solve problems in the easy category before September 5, but none of the problems after September 12.

In fact, we can definitively show that it has memorized problems in its training set: when prompted with the title of a Codeforces problem, GPT-4 includes a link to the exact contest where the problem appears (and the round number is almost correct: it is off by one). Note that GPT-4 cannot access the Internet, so memorization is the only explanation."

I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

I do **not** count alternative **frontend** projects because they just call the API from OpenAI. 
I do **not** consider alternative **transformer decoder** to GPT 3.5 either because the training data of them are (mostly) not for chat system.

This is a massive, massive deal. For context, the reason GPT-3 apps took off over the past few months before ChatGPT went viral is because a) text-davinci-003 was released and was a significant performance increase and b) the cost was cut from $0.06/1k tokens to $0.02/1k tokens, which made consumer applications feasible without a large upfront cost.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

[video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

I did a quick experiment with Pytorch 2.0 Native scaled\_dot\_product\_attention. I was able to a single forward pass within 9GB of memory which is astounding. I think by patching existing Pretrained GPT models and adding more positional encodings, one could easily fine-tune those models to 32k attention on a single A100 80GB. Here is the code I used:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6csxe28lv9oa1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff8b48a77f49fab7d088fd8ba220f720860249bc

I think it should be possible to replicate even GPT-4 with open source tools something like Bloom + FlashAttention & fine-tune on 32k tokens.

**Update**: I was successfully able to start the training of GPT-2 (125M) with a context size of 8k and batch size of 1 on a 16GB GPU. Since memory scaled linearly from 4k to 8k. I am expecting, 32k would require \~64GB and should train smoothly on A100 80 GB. Also, I did not do any other optimizations. Maybe 8-bit fine-tuning can further optimize it.

**Update 2**: I basically picked Karpaty's nanoGPT and patched the pretrained GPT-2 by repeating the embeddings N-times. I was unable to train the model at 8k because generation would cause the crash.  So I started the training for a context window of 4k on The Pile: 1 hour in and loss seems to be going down pretty fast. Also Karpaty's generate function is super inefficient, O(n\^4) I think so it took forever to generate even 2k tokens. So I generate 1100 tokens just to see if the model is able to go beyond 1k limit. And it seems to be working. [Here are some samples](https://0bin.net/paste/O-+eopaW#nmtzX1Re7f1Nr-Otz606jkltvKk/kUXY96/8ca+tb4f) at 3k iteration.

**Update 3**: I have started the training and I am publishing the training script if anyone is interested in replicating or building upon this work. Here is the complete training script:

[https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c](https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c)

I will post an update after the weekend once the training has progressed somewhat.

**Post-Weekend Update**: After \~50k iterations (the model has seen \~200 million tokens, I know this is just too small compared to 10s of billions trained by giga corps), loss only dropped from 4.6 to 4.2 on The Pile:

https://preview.redd.it/vi0fpskhsuoa1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fccc5277d91a6400adc6d968b0f2f0ff0da2afc

AFAIR, the loss of GPT-2 on the Pile if trained with 1024 tokens is \~2.8. It seems like the size of the dimension for each token is kind of limiting how much loss can go down since GPT-2 (small) has an embedding dimension of 768. Maybe someone can experiment with GPT-2 medium etc. to see how much we can improve.

I am currently experimenting with the viability of LLM models for Japanese to English translation. I've been experimenting with GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 utilizing the DAN protocols, and GPT 4 for this project for around 3 months now with very promising results and I think I've identified several limitations with GPT that if addressed can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of translations.

&#x200B;

The project I'm working on is attempting to translate a light novel series from japanese to english. During these tests I did a deep dive, asking GPT how it is attempting the translations and asking it to modify its translation methodology through various means (I am considering doing a long video outlining all this and showing off the prompts and responses at a later date). Notably this includes asking it to utilize its understanding of the series its translating from its training knowledge to aide in the translation, and providing it with a ""seed"" translation. Basically the seed is a side by side japanese and english translation to show GPT what I'm looking for in terms of grammar and formatting. The english translation notably is a human translation, not a machine translation. The results from these tests provided SIGNIFICANT improvements to the final translation, so significant in fact that a large portion of the text could reasonably be assumed to be human-translated.

&#x200B;

Link to the project I'm working on so you can see my documentation and results: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT\_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

I've probably done around 50-100 hours of extensive testing with translation and methodology over the past 2-3 months. Over that time I've discovered the following:

1. Both GPT3 and GPT4 are significant improvements over traditional translation services such as google or deepl. This may be because Japanese and English are very different languages in how they are written and how their grammar works so prior translation services simply did a direct translation while GPT is capable of understanding the text and rewriting it to account for that. For example in japanese, there are no pronouns like ""he"" and ""her"" so a person's gender might not be clear from the sentence alone. Google Translate and DeepL typically just take a 50/50 guess, while GPT from my experience has been much more capable in getting this right based on understanding the larger context from the paragraph.
2. GPT has a tendency to censor text deliberately if it feels the translation may offend people. This isn't just for things that are blatantly offensive like slurs, it also includes mild sexual content, the kind that is typically approved for teen viewing/reading. The biggest problem is that it doesn't tell you it is censoring anything unless you ask it, meaning everything else may be a solid translation yet it may censor information which can ultimately hurt the translation, especially for story related translations like in my tests. These restrictions can be bypassed with correct prompting. I've had luck using GPT 3's DAN protocols however DAN's translations arent as strong as GPT 4, and I've had luck with GPT 4 by framing the translation as a game with extreme win and loss conditions and telling it that if it censors the translation, it may offend the author of the content since people in japan hold different values from our own.
3. GPT puts too high a focus on accuracy even if instructed not to. This is a good thing to a degree since outside of censorship you know the translation is accurate, however even when explicitly told to put maximum emphasis on readability, even if it hurts the accuracy, and it is allowed to rewrite sentences from the ground up to aide readability, it still puts too strong an emphasis on accuracy. I have determined this through testing that for some reason it is ignoring the request to focus on readability and will still maximize accuracy. The best way I've found to fix this issue is through demonstration, specifically the ""seed"" I mentioned earlier. By giving it a japanese and english translation of the same work but earlier in the story, it then understands how to put more emphasis on readability. The results is something that is 95% within the range of accuracy a professional translator would use while much easier to read.
4. GPT's biggest limitation is the fact that it ""forgets"" the seed way too quickly, usually within a few prompts. I've done testing with its data retention and it appears that if you give it too much information to remember at once it slowly bugs out. With GPT 3 its a hard crash type bug where it just spews nonsense unrelated to your request, however GPT 4 can remember a lot more information and will hard crash if you give it too much info but otherwise builds up errors slowly as you give it more info. I initially believed that there were issues with the token count, but further testing shows that the GPT model simply isn't optimized for this method of translation and a new or reworked model that you can give a seed and it will remember it longer would be better. The seed is one of the best tools for improving its performance

Next steps:

I would like to try to either create my own model or modify an existing one to optimize it for translation. If any1 knows any tools or guides I'd appreciate it."

Apologies if it’s been shared here already. 

*We introduce Alpaca 7B, a model fine-tuned from the LLaMA 7B model on 52K instruction-following demonstrations. On our preliminary evaluation of single-turn instruction following, Alpaca behaves qualitatively similarly to OpenAI’s text-davinci-003, while being surprisingly small and easy/cheap to reproduce (<600$).*

Basically, starting w an open source Meta 7B LLaMa model, they recruited GPT-3.5 to use for self-instruct training (as opposed to RLHF) and were able to produce a model that behaved similar to GPT-3.5. Amazingly, the process only took few weeks and $600 in compute cost.  

Any thoughts on how such low cost to train/deploy LLMs could affect companies like AMD, Nvidia and Intel etc? This seems like new idiom of AI tech and trying to wrap my head around CPU/GPU demand implications given the apparent orders of magnitude training cost reduction.

I am no programmer, and I have a very basic knowledge of machine learning, but I am fascinated by the possibilities offered by all the new models we have seen so far. 

Some people around me say they are not that impressed by what AIs can do, so I built a small test (with a little help by chatGPT to code the whole thing): can you always 100% distinguish between AI art or text and old works of art or literature?

Here is the site: http://aiorart.com/

I find that AI-generated text is still generally easy to spot, but of course it is very challenging to go against great literary works. AI images can sometimes be truly deceptive.

I wonder what you will all think of it... and how all that will evolve in the coming months!

Preliminary evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge shows Vicuna-13B achieves more than 90%\* quality of OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard while outperforming other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca in more than 90%\* of cases. The cost of training Vicuna-13B is around $300. The training and serving [code](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), along with an online [demo](https://chat.lmsys.org/), are publicly available for non-commercial use.

# Training details

Vicuna is created by fine-tuning a LLaMA base model using approximately 70K user-shared conversations gathered from ShareGPT.com with public APIs. To ensure data quality, we convert the HTML back to markdown and filter out some inappropriate or low-quality samples. Additionally, we divide lengthy conversations into smaller segments that fit the model’s maximum context length.

Our training recipe builds on top of [Stanford’s alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) with the following improvements.

* **Memory Optimizations:** To enable Vicuna’s understanding of long context, we expand the max context length from 512 in alpaca to 2048, which substantially increases GPU memory requirements. We tackle the memory pressure by utilizing [gradient checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174) and [flash attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135).
* **Multi-round conversations:** We adjust the training loss to account for multi-round conversations and compute the fine-tuning loss solely on the chatbot’s output.
* **Cost Reduction via Spot Instance:** The 40x larger dataset and 4x sequence length for training poses a considerable challenge in training expenses. We employ [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) [managed spot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/spot-jobs.html) to reduce the cost by leveraging the cheaper spot instances with auto-recovery for preemptions and auto zone switch. This solution slashes costs for training the 7B model from $500 to around $140 and the 13B model from around $1K to $300.

# Limitations

We have noticed that, similar to other large language models, Vicuna has certain limitations. For instance, it is not good at tasks involving reasoning or mathematics, and it may have limitations in accurately identifying itself or ensuring the factual accuracy of its outputs. Additionally, it has not been sufficiently optimized to guarantee safety or mitigate potential toxicity or bias. To address the safety concerns, we use the OpenAI [moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview) API to filter out inappropriate user inputs in our online demo. Nonetheless, we anticipate that Vicuna can serve as an open starting point for future research to tackle these limitations.

Abstract:

>Existing language models (LMs) predict tokens with a softmax over a finite vocabulary, which can make it difficult to predict rare tokens or phrases. We introduce **NPM**, the first **nonparametric masked language model** that **replaces this softmax with a nonparametric distribution over every phrase in a reference corpus**. We show that NPM can be efficiently trained with a contrastive objective and an in-batch approximation to full corpus retrieval. Zero-shot evaluation on 9 closed-set tasks and 7 open-set tasks demonstrates that **NPM outperforms significantly larger parametric models, either with or without a retrieve-and-generate approach**. It is particularly **better on dealing with rare patterns (word senses or facts),** and **predicting rare or nearly unseen words (e.g., non-Latin script)**.

I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

*OpenAI may have tested on the training data. Besides, human benchmarks are meaningless for bots.*

 **Problem 1: training data contamination**

To benchmark GPT-4’s coding ability, OpenAI evaluated it on problems from Codeforces, a website that hosts coding competitions. Surprisingly, Horace He pointed out that GPT-4 solved 10/10 pre-2021 problems and 0/10 recent problems in the easy category. The training data cutoff for GPT-4 is September 2021. This strongly suggests that the model is able to memorize solutions from its training set — or at least partly memorize them, enough that it can fill in what it can’t recall.

As further evidence for this hypothesis, we tested it on Codeforces problems from different times in 2021. We found that it could regularly solve problems in the easy category before September 5, but none of the problems after September 12.

In fact, we can definitively show that it has memorized problems in its training set: when prompted with the title of a Codeforces problem, GPT-4 includes a link to the exact contest where the problem appears (and the round number is almost correct: it is off by one). Note that GPT-4 cannot access the Internet, so memorization is the only explanation."

I recently read [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/i_lost_everything_that_made_me_love_my_job/) about a 2D modeler experiencing an existential crisis about their job being disrupted by midjourney ([HN discussion here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35319861)). I can't help but feel the same as someone who has been working in the applied ML space for the past few years. 

Despite my background in ""classical"" ML, I'm feeling some anxiety about the rapid pace of LLM development and face a fear of missing out / being left behind.

I'd love to get involved again in ML research apart from my day job, but one of the biggest obstacles is the fact that training most of foundational LLM research requires huge compute more than anything else \[1\]. I understand that there are some directions in distributing compute ([https://petals.ml](https://petals.ml/)), or distilling existing models  ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)). 

I thought I might not be the only one being humbled by the recent advances in ChatGPT, etc. and wanted to hear how other people feel / are getting involved.

\[1\] I can't help but be reminded of Sutton's description of the [""bitter lesson"" of modern AI research](https://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html): ""breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation... eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach."""

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

The command format  used in this example was designed to mimic the syntax of systems like autogpt. For context, autogpt and similar apps look for JSON commands which are then passed to methods to invoke server-side code.

The goal is to show that a user can bury malicious prompts inside of text. If the prompt is sufficiently convincing, GPT will do what it says instead of follow the original task. *An attack like this could be used to execute any command the bot is capable of.*

Consider the case of LLMs tasked to scrape internet data or read databases. Just one malicious prompt could corrupt the entire process. Since the bot understands natural language, almost any user could attempt an attack like this."

Preliminary evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge shows Vicuna-13B achieves more than 90%\* quality of OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard while outperforming other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca in more than 90%\* of cases. The cost of training Vicuna-13B is around $300. The training and serving [code](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), along with an online [demo](https://chat.lmsys.org/), are publicly available for non-commercial use.

# Training details

Vicuna is created by fine-tuning a LLaMA base model using approximately 70K user-shared conversations gathered from ShareGPT.com with public APIs. To ensure data quality, we convert the HTML back to markdown and filter out some inappropriate or low-quality samples. Additionally, we divide lengthy conversations into smaller segments that fit the model’s maximum context length.

Our training recipe builds on top of [Stanford’s alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) with the following improvements.

* **Memory Optimizations:** To enable Vicuna’s understanding of long context, we expand the max context length from 512 in alpaca to 2048, which substantially increases GPU memory requirements. We tackle the memory pressure by utilizing [gradient checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174) and [flash attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135).
* **Multi-round conversations:** We adjust the training loss to account for multi-round conversations and compute the fine-tuning loss solely on the chatbot’s output.
* **Cost Reduction via Spot Instance:** The 40x larger dataset and 4x sequence length for training poses a considerable challenge in training expenses. We employ [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) [managed spot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/spot-jobs.html) to reduce the cost by leveraging the cheaper spot instances with auto-recovery for preemptions and auto zone switch. This solution slashes costs for training the 7B model from $500 to around $140 and the 13B model from around $1K to $300.

# Limitations

We have noticed that, similar to other large language models, Vicuna has certain limitations. For instance, it is not good at tasks involving reasoning or mathematics, and it may have limitations in accurately identifying itself or ensuring the factual accuracy of its outputs. Additionally, it has not been sufficiently optimized to guarantee safety or mitigate potential toxicity or bias. To address the safety concerns, we use the OpenAI [moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview) API to filter out inappropriate user inputs in our online demo. Nonetheless, we anticipate that Vicuna can serve as an open starting point for future research to tackle these limitations.

I get to plot a histogram with the numbers and they are close to what I would consider an exponential distribution with such parameter (you can see the plot).

Given that GPT 3.5 does not have access to a Python interpreter, how on earth is it able to do so? I have also tried other distributions and parameters and it kind of works. It's not perfect, but with normal distributions it is usually close to what scipy.stats would generate.

I could understand that it can have learnt to interpret Python code to some extent, but honestly I can't find explanation for random sampling from a probability distribution. For a Normal distribution, I can tell it about the desired mean and variance, and it samples values that are more than reasonable (and close to the true mean/variance specified).

Any thoughts? I honestly am unable to wrap my head around how a LLM can have the understanding on how to sample tokens (at digit level) to fit any probability distribution. To me it seems very unlikely to have similar data either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages."

But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

Any comments, inputs, rants, counter-arguments are welcome.

I did a quick experiment with Pytorch 2.0 Native scaled\_dot\_product\_attention. I was able to a single forward pass within 9GB of memory which is astounding. I think by patching existing Pretrained GPT models and adding more positional encodings, one could easily fine-tune those models to 32k attention on a single A100 80GB. Here is the code I used:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6csxe28lv9oa1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff8b48a77f49fab7d088fd8ba220f720860249bc

I think it should be possible to replicate even GPT-4 with open source tools something like Bloom + FlashAttention & fine-tune on 32k tokens.

**Update**: I was successfully able to start the training of GPT-2 (125M) with a context size of 8k and batch size of 1 on a 16GB GPU. Since memory scaled linearly from 4k to 8k. I am expecting, 32k would require \~64GB and should train smoothly on A100 80 GB. Also, I did not do any other optimizations. Maybe 8-bit fine-tuning can further optimize it.

**Update 2**: I basically picked Karpaty's nanoGPT and patched the pretrained GPT-2 by repeating the embeddings N-times. I was unable to train the model at 8k because generation would cause the crash.  So I started the training for a context window of 4k on The Pile: 1 hour in and loss seems to be going down pretty fast. Also Karpaty's generate function is super inefficient, O(n\^4) I think so it took forever to generate even 2k tokens. So I generate 1100 tokens just to see if the model is able to go beyond 1k limit. And it seems to be working. [Here are some samples](https://0bin.net/paste/O-+eopaW#nmtzX1Re7f1Nr-Otz606jkltvKk/kUXY96/8ca+tb4f) at 3k iteration.

**Update 3**: I have started the training and I am publishing the training script if anyone is interested in replicating or building upon this work. Here is the complete training script:

[https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c](https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c)

I will post an update after the weekend once the training has progressed somewhat.

**Post-Weekend Update**: After \~50k iterations (the model has seen \~200 million tokens, I know this is just too small compared to 10s of billions trained by giga corps), loss only dropped from 4.6 to 4.2 on The Pile:

https://preview.redd.it/vi0fpskhsuoa1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fccc5277d91a6400adc6d968b0f2f0ff0da2afc

AFAIR, the loss of GPT-2 on the Pile if trained with 1024 tokens is \~2.8. It seems like the size of the dimension for each token is kind of limiting how much loss can go down since GPT-2 (small) has an embedding dimension of 768. Maybe someone can experiment with GPT-2 medium etc. to see how much we can improve.

From my personal experience, the quality of the model depends a lot on the fine-tuning data as opposed to just the sheer size. If you choose your retraining data correctly, you can fine-tune your smaller model to perform better than the state-of-the-art GPT-X. The future of LLMs might look more open-source than imagined 3 months back?

Would love to hear everyone's opinions on how they see the future of LLMs evolving? Will it be few players (OpenAI) cracking the AGI and conquering the whole world or a lot of smaller open-source models which ML engineers fine-tune for their use-cases?

P.S. I am kinda betting on the latter and building [UpTrain](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain), an open-source project which helps you collect that high quality fine-tuning dataset"

Abstract:

>Recent advancements in decision-making large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive performance across various benchmarks. However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing these methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess certain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, **specifically the ability to learn from mistakes**. **Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve novel problems through a process of trial and error.** Building on recent research, we propose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with **dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities.** To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective heuristic that **enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances, avoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment.** To assess our approach, we evaluate the agent's ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments and knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA environments. We observe success rates of 97% and 51%, respectively, and provide a discussion on the emergent property of self-reflection.

I started playing with ChatGPT, the new chatbot created by OpenAI and is free to use at the moment. 

I asked it to describe a scene between Batman and Joker on a subway platform and the result is mind blowing! I let you have a read of the story yourself:

Generated by ChatGPT:

The scene is set in a dimly lit subway station, with the Joker standing on the platform, gazing up at Batman who is perched on a nearby overhead beam. The Joker is dressed in his signature purple suit and green hair, a wicked grin plastered across his face.

In his hand, he holds a deck of playing cards, flipping them expertly through his fingers. The sound of the cards shuffling echoes through the empty station.

Batman, dressed in his dark suit and cape, stares down at the Joker with a steely gaze. His muscles are tense, ready for any sudden movements from the villain.

The Joker cackles, his laughter bouncing off the walls of the station. ""Hello, Batsy! Long time no see. How's the crime-fighting business these days?""

Batman remains silent, watching the Joker carefully.

The Joker's grin widens. ""Come on, Bats. Don't be so serious all the time. Let's have some fun."" He tosses a card at Batman, who easily catches it.

""I'm not here to play games, Joker,"" Batman says in a grave tone.

The Joker's laughter turns into a maniacal cackle. ""But that's the whole point, Batsy! Life is a game. And I'm the master of it.""

He pulls out a bomb from his pocket and holds it up, the timer ticking down. ""Let's see how well you can play, shall we?""

Batman leaps down from the beam, landing gracefully on the platform. He advances towards the Joker, who backs away, still holding the bomb.

The tension in the air is palpable as the two foes face off, each ready to outsmart the other. The sound of the bomb's timer counts down, adding to the tension of the scene.

The Joker's grin never fades, even as Batman inches closer. ""It's always a pleasure to play with you, Batsy. But I think it's time for me to make my exit.""

With a flourish, the Joker disappears in a cloud of smoke, leaving Batman standing alone on the platform. The bomb detonates, causing a small explosion and sending debris flying.

But Batman remains unharmed, ready to continue the never-ending battle against the Joker and all the evil that plagues the city.

End of the story.

This is a massive, massive deal. For context, the reason GPT-3 apps took off over the past few months before ChatGPT went viral is because a) text-davinci-003 was released and was a significant performance increase and b) the cost was cut from $0.06/1k tokens to $0.02/1k tokens, which made consumer applications feasible without a large upfront cost.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

*OpenAI may have tested on the training data. Besides, human benchmarks are meaningless for bots.*

 **Problem 1: training data contamination**

To benchmark GPT-4’s coding ability, OpenAI evaluated it on problems from Codeforces, a website that hosts coding competitions. Surprisingly, Horace He pointed out that GPT-4 solved 10/10 pre-2021 problems and 0/10 recent problems in the easy category. The training data cutoff for GPT-4 is September 2021. This strongly suggests that the model is able to memorize solutions from its training set — or at least partly memorize them, enough that it can fill in what it can’t recall.

As further evidence for this hypothesis, we tested it on Codeforces problems from different times in 2021. We found that it could regularly solve problems in the easy category before September 5, but none of the problems after September 12.

In fact, we can definitively show that it has memorized problems in its training set: when prompted with the title of a Codeforces problem, GPT-4 includes a link to the exact contest where the problem appears (and the round number is almost correct: it is off by one). Note that GPT-4 cannot access the Internet, so memorization is the only explanation."

* **Minimal prompt overhead** \- Every token counts. We are continuously working on getting the best results with the least possible number of tokens.
* **Human in the Loop** \- Ability to ""course correct"" agents who go astray via human feedback.
* **Full state serialization** \- Pick up where you left off; L♾️pGPT can save the complete state of an agent, including memory and the states of its tools to a file or python object. No external databases or vector stores required (but they are still supported)!"

It warns of the potential for GPT-4 to produce malicious code and highly tailored propaganda and the risk that biased training data could result in baked-in stereotypes or unfair race and gender preferences in hiring. 

The complaint also mentions significant privacy failures with OpenAI's product interface, such as a recent bug that exposed OpenAI ChatGPT histories and possibly payment details of ChatGPT plus subscribers.

116,zstequ,MachineLearning,GPT,relevance,2022-12-22 18:39:30,[D] When chatGPT stops being free: Run SOTA LLM in cloud,_underlines_,False,0.95,347,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/zstequ/d_when_chatgpt_stops_being_free_run_sota_llm_in/,95,1671734370.0,"Edit: Found [LAION-AI/OPEN-ASSISTANT](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant) a very promising project opensourcing the idea of chatGPT. [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

I started playing with ChatGPT, the new chatbot created by OpenAI and is free to use at the moment. 

I asked it to describe a scene between Batman and Joker on a subway platform and the result is mind blowing! I let you have a read of the story yourself:

Generated by ChatGPT:

The scene is set in a dimly lit subway station, with the Joker standing on the platform, gazing up at Batman who is perched on a nearby overhead beam. The Joker is dressed in his signature purple suit and green hair, a wicked grin plastered across his face.

In his hand, he holds a deck of playing cards, flipping them expertly through his fingers. The sound of the cards shuffling echoes through the empty station.

Batman, dressed in his dark suit and cape, stares down at the Joker with a steely gaze. His muscles are tense, ready for any sudden movements from the villain.

The Joker cackles, his laughter bouncing off the walls of the station. ""Hello, Batsy! Long time no see. How's the crime-fighting business these days?""

Batman remains silent, watching the Joker carefully.

The Joker's grin widens. ""Come on, Bats. Don't be so serious all the time. Let's have some fun."" He tosses a card at Batman, who easily catches it.

""I'm not here to play games, Joker,"" Batman says in a grave tone.

The Joker's laughter turns into a maniacal cackle. ""But that's the whole point, Batsy! Life is a game. And I'm the master of it.""

He pulls out a bomb from his pocket and holds it up, the timer ticking down. ""Let's see how well you can play, shall we?""

Batman leaps down from the beam, landing gracefully on the platform. He advances towards the Joker, who backs away, still holding the bomb.

The tension in the air is palpable as the two foes face off, each ready to outsmart the other. The sound of the bomb's timer counts down, adding to the tension of the scene.

The Joker's grin never fades, even as Batman inches closer. ""It's always a pleasure to play with you, Batsy. But I think it's time for me to make my exit.""

With a flourish, the Joker disappears in a cloud of smoke, leaving Batman standing alone on the platform. The bomb detonates, causing a small explosion and sending debris flying.

But Batman remains unharmed, ready to continue the never-ending battle against the Joker and all the evil that plagues the city.

End of the story.

I used the first two paragraphs in OpenAI’s Dall E 2 to generate an image and [this](https://labs.openai.com/s/p8L8Z6c3S7qZ26U7owfbx7lS) is the result I got.

I've been working on a project that I'm excited to share with this  community. It's called SmartGPT, a tool that extends the capabilities of  GPT-4 by generating and analyzing multiple responses to enhance the  quality of the final output.

When you ask SmartGPT a question, it generates several responses,  identifies their strengths and weaknesses, and then refines these  observations into a more accurate and comprehensive answer. It's  essentially like giving GPT-4 an opportunity to brainstorm before  settling on a final response.

The idea was inspired by a YouTube video that discussed potential ways  to improve the performance of GPT models. Here's the link if you're  interested: [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVzuvf9D9BU).

While very simple on the surface, this may actually be very true: what if we are training our language models to be very shallow thinkers and not actually look far enough ahead? Could single token prediction actually be a fundamental flaw?

In this repo, I try a very early experiment called GPT-3T, a model that predicts 3 tokens ahead at one time step. While incredibly simple on the surface, this could potentially be one way to overcome the planning issue that you find in GPTs. Forcing an autoregressive model to predict further ahead at scale *may* bring out much more interesting emergent behaviours than what we’ve seen in single token GPTs.

__

**Experiments**

My personal experiments are overall inconclusive on either side: I have only pre-trained a very small model (300 million params on WebText-10K) and it achieves a decent ability to generate text. However as you can see, this model heavily under optimized but I do not have the resources to carry this out further.

If anyone would like to try this experiment with more scale, I would love to get an answer to this question to improve upon this model. This repo is intended to allow anyone who would like to pre-train a GPT-3T model easily to run this experiment. From what I have seen, this has not been tried before and I am very curious to see results.

What do you all think of this approach to full stack gpt-assisted web development? In a sense its no code because the human user does not write or even edit the code - but in a sense its the opposite, because only an experienced web developer or at least a product manager would know how to instruct GPT in a useful manner.

\*\*\* We are seeking donations to ensure this project continues and, quite literally, keep the lights on. Cryptos, cash, cards, openai access tokens with free credits, hardware, cloud GPUs, etc... all is appreciated. Please DM to support this really cool open source project \*\*\*

PS. I'm the injured engineer who made this thing out of necessity, because i injured my wrist building an AI platform that's become way too big for one engineer to maintain. So AMA :)"

This limits their use cases and prohibits more ambitious prompts.

This was recently resolved by researchers at Google Brain in Alberta, Canada. In their recent paper they describe a new method of using associative memory which removes the text limit and they also prove that some large language models are universal Turing machines.

This will pave the way for entire novels being shared with large language models, personal genomes, etc.

The paper talks about the use of ""associative memory"" which is also known as content-addressable memory (CAM). This type of memory allows the system to retrieve data based on its content rather than its location. Unlike traditional memory systems that use specific memory addresses to access data, associative memory uses CAM to find data based on a pattern or keyword.

Presumably, this will open up a new market for associative memory since I would happily pay some extra money for content to be permanently stored in associative memory and to remove the text limit. This will also drive down the price of associative memory if millions of people are willing to pay a monthly fee for storage and the removal of prompt text limits.

The paper does point that there are still problems with conditional statements that confuse the large language models. However, I believe this can be resolved with semantic graphs. This would involve collecting data from various sources and using natural language processing techniques to extract entities and relationships from the text. Once the graph is constructed, it could be integrated into the language model in a variety of ways. One approach is to use the graph as an external memory, similar to the approach taken in the paper. The graph can be encoded as a set of key-value pairs and used to augment the model's attention mechanism during inference. The attention mechanism can then focus on relevant nodes in the graph when generating outputs.

Another potential approach is to incorporate the graph into the model's architecture itself. For example, the graph can be used to inform the initialization of the model's parameters or to guide the attention mechanism during training. This could help the model learn to reason about complex concepts and relationships more effectively, potentially leading to better performance on tasks that require this kind of reasoning.

The use of knowledge graphs can also help ground truth large language models and reduce hallucinations.

I'm curious to read your thoughts."
