2,13dk32o,MachineLearning,GPT,controversial,2023-05-10 08:11:24,[D] When will a GPT-like model outperform Stockfish in chess?,ThePerson654321,False,0.51,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/13dk32o/d_when_will_a_gptlike_model_outperform_stockfish/,55,1683706284.0,"Hello!

GPT-4 has shown significant improvement over GPT-3 in terms of playing chess, with what I estimate to be a ELO rating of around 1000 now. While this is impressive, it is still nowhere near the performance level of Stockfish. This has led me to ponder the following question:

How many years do you think it will take for a GPT-like model (not specifically or even intentionally trained for chess) to surpass Stockfish in terms of chess-playing abilities?"

First, we identified the biggest hole in the AI market: a voice-first, web-connected, clean mobile app to bring ChatGPT to the masses. Then, it helped me with feature dev, backend, frontend, and even this post.

Ended up calling it [Jackchat](https://www.jackchat.ai/) (had to name it after myself lol). You can use voice to talk to ChatGPT (big voice button), it can talk back to you with voice, it’s connected to the web, it's free, and it doesn’t require an account to use. Surprisingly, it's replaced me and most of my friend’s Google usage.
