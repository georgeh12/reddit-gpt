I'm excited to share my latest article about a new open-source technology called OpenChatKit.

For those who work in NLP, you're probably familiar with ChatGPT - a powerful language model that can perform various natural language processing tasks. However, ChatGPT is not open-source, which limits its accessibility and customizability.

OpenChatKit, on the other hand, is an open-source alternative to ChatGPT that provides users with similar NLP capabilities while allowing for more customization and control. With OpenChatKit, users can train their own models and fine-tune them to their specific use cases.

In my article, I dive into the features of OpenChatKit, the Instruction-tuned Large Language Model, and the Limitations of the Model.

If you're interested in learning more about OpenChatKit and how it can enhance your NLP workflows, check out my article [OpenChatKit: Open-Source ChatGPT Alternative ](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/03/openchatkit-opensource-chatgpt-alternative.html).

As the world is increasingly generating vast amounts of financial data, the need for advanced tools to analyze and make sense of it has never been greater. This is where [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [Deep Lake](https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake) come in, offering a powerful combination of technology to help build a question-answering tool based on financial data. After participating in a LangChain hackathon last week, I created a way to use Deep Lake, the data lake for deep learning (a package my team and I are building) with LangChain. I decided to put together a guide of sorts on how you can approach building your own question-answering tools with  LangChain and Deep Lake as the data store.

Read [the article](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/ultimate-guide-to-lang-chain-deep-lake-build-chat-gpt-to-answer-questions-on-your-financial-data/) to learn:

1. What is LangChain, what are its benefits and use cases and how you can use to streamline your LLM (Large Language Model) development?  
2. How to use [\#LangChain](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=langchain&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7037082545263448064) and [\#DeepLake](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=deeplake&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7037082545263448064) together to build [\#ChatGPT](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=chatgpt&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7037082545263448064) for your financial documents.  
3. How Deep Lake’s unified and streamable data store enables fast prototyping without the need to recompute embeddings (something that costs time & money).

I wanted to give a sophisticated chatbot like ChatGPT a bunch of data and text from (for instance, not my end goal) a philosopher, and have it answer questions as if it was that philosopher, ague against what I say as if it was a person who believed what the text I gave it said and so on, all while still able to use online resources (like ChatGPT does) to find additional supporting information, rather than only the text I give it which might limit its ability to give coherent arguments. In summary, I want it's beliefs  and values to be limited to a specific source text, but not it's knowledge base. 

&#x200B;

How would I go about this? Do I have to develop a model from scratch to give it any text sources I want, or is it possible to do with an existing API? I was going to use Character.AI but the method for giving it information is too limited for what I want to do.

Is SEO really dead? Or will it evolve? Back then I kept wondering if it’s true or not. Some believe SEO is dead, some don’t. But now with tools like Chat GPT and Midjourney, I think it’s time to take a look back and see how this might change SEO or if it will “kill” SEO.

I keep seeing threads and discussions seeing how people are excited and worried at the same time with how AI might be able to do a better job. But the way I see it, AI content still needs a person to tell it what to do and make the writing look nice. And also I think that the internet will have a lot of writing that was made by AI and that might change how we find things online. You might also see a ton of content being written by AI and trigger some plagiarism detectors and have a lot of websites get penalized. Hopefully the internet won’t be filled with boilerplate copy/pasted content coming from Chat GPT.

Well we have Google to filter out trash content anyway. But I know Google has some issues lately that they need to fix. One is that they also have AI that can help people find things on the internet with their search engine, and they need to make sure they are still the best in terms of search. 

The second is that Google needs to find a way to tell if something is really good or not, like how some websites that show art do. Google wants to show the best thing first, but it's hard because sometimes the thing that is the best is also something that Google's customers want people to see. It’s possible that some AI generated contentSo it's kind of tricky.

I have a feeling companies that already make SEO-writing and checking bots are gonna roll out some fresh new models soon. They're gonna be even better than before. These bots are going to write some good articles and product descriptions that are almost perfect. It almost looks like a human wrote the article or description. And all a human will do is quickly check for any false claims and write a headline that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it. 

We can only really tell 5-10 years from now. In the meantime, I’ll probably go back practicing some handyman skills and also go back teaching people how to drive and also be a service driver. These jobs I had in the past were way different from what I am earning now but if the worst comes to worst, at least I have these physical skills ready."

**TLDR:**

Looking for ML buddies at any level (preferably beginners) who want to start freelancing together. The goal is to build a small local community of ML enthusiasts who can support each other and exchange knowledge. We will use freelance collaboration as our main activity. We're also looking for experienced mentors (paid or unpaid) to guide us.

**Extended:**

I believe that learning and growing in a group is much more enjoyable and effective. That's why I'm trying to create a community of like-minded individuals.

I'm looking to create a small, local community for people who are starting out in freelancing, and who are interested in mutual support. Our main activity will be a Discord channel where members can post their work and collaborate on projects, with payment split by agreement. Additionally, we plan to engage in activities such as knowledge exchange, live coding, supporting each other's pet projects, and hosting study sessions.

This community will be small and focused, with members who can trust each other and share similar goals. We're also looking for experienced mentors who can provide guidance as we navigate the world of ML freelancing. Whether paid or unpaid, we welcome any support and advice.

About me: I'm a 21-year-old self-taught ML enthusiast from Russia. Although I don't have any experience in freelancing, I'm eager to start taking my first steps towards making money and gaining experience. As a beginner, I'm hoping to connect with others who are at a similar level and are also looking to grow.

I am speaking from the point of view of a data scientist not working in research.

Until now, learning NLP could be used to meet occasional business needs like sentiment analysis, text classification, topic modeling....

With the opening of GPT-3 to the public, the rise of ChatGPT, and the huge wave of applications, sites, plug-ins and extensions based on this technology that are accessible with a simple API request, it's impossible not to wonder if spending dozens of hours diving into this field if ML wouldn't be as useful today as learning the source code of the Pandas library. 

In some specialized cases, it could be useful, but GPT-3, and the models that will follow, seem to offer more than sufficient results for the immensity of the cases and for almost all classical NLP tasks. Not only that, but there is a good chance that the models trained by giants like Open-AI (Microsoft) or Google can never be replicated outside these companies anyway.  With ChatGPT and its incomparable mastery of language, its ability to code, summarize, extract topics, understand... why would I bother to use BERT or a TF-IDF vectorizer when an API will be released? Not only it would be easily accessible, but it also would be much better at the task, faster and cheaper.

In fact, it's a concern regarding all the machine learning field in general with the arrival of powerful ""no-code"" applications, which abstract a large part of the inherent complexity of the field. There will always be a need for experts, for safeguards, but in the end, won't the Data Scientist who masters the features of GPT-3 or 4 and knows a bit of NLP be more efficient than the one who has spent hours reading Google papers and practicing on Gensim, NLTK, spacy... It is the purpose of an API to make things simpler eventually... At what point is there no more reason to be interested in the behind-the-scenes of these tools and to become simple users rather than trying to develop our own techniques?"

I just uploaded a video on my Youtube channel covering 50 important concepts discussing the last 10 years of NLP/Language Modeling research. 

The video covers the basics of word embeddings, tokenizers, and then the RNN based Seq2Seq architectures of the mid 2010s… then describes Attention/Transformers and some of the key Transformer-based LM research from 2017-2021. Finally, I cover human alignment / RLHF / instruction tuning with InstructGPT, ChatGPT and GPT-4. I tried to make a video that is accessible for new researchers/students to get their feet wet, and for guys like me to reminisce and celebrate the RNNs / self-supervised Transformer era as we step into the new world of human aligned LLMs. 

I am a small YT channel, and this is my first time doing a video of this scale (I normally do Reinforcement Learning stuff/paper reviews), so this was a fun and challenging video to produce. Feel free to check it out and leave any feedback for me to improve my content!

Github here: https://github.com/sgreenb/pico_assistant

One extremally simple modification that dramatically improves the ability of a GPT to answer questions: letting it Google stuff.

Here’s a demo:

https://imgur.com/ZR6hvLg 1

The implementation works like this.

1. A user enters an input.
2. An agent called “Executive” looks at the input and decides if an API like Spotify, Twillio, or Gmail is needed or if it can be answered by the chatbot alone.
3. If the chatbot is needed the input is first sent to a Google agent. The Google agent’s system message looks like this:

```
{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You analyze a user's input to a large language model with \
training data that cuts off at September 2021. The current year is 2023. You decide how \
likely it is that a user's request will benefit from a Google search to help address the\
question. Respond with a number in the range 1-10, where 1 is very unlikely that a \
Google search would be beneficial, and 10 meaning a Google search is highly necessary.""}
```

This is quite fast, since it only needs to generate one or two tokens.

If the output is above some threshold (say 7), then we call another agent, the query agent, otherwise we return False and default to the normal chat agent.

```
    google_probability = int(completion.choices[0].message.content)
    if google_probability >= cutoff:
        search_results = trim_text(search_and_scrape(prompt))
        query_with_context = prompt + str(search_results)
        print(""\nPico: "", end='', flush=True)
        response = query_agent_stream(query_with_context)
        return response
    else:
        return False
```

When we call the query agent, we feed it the first part of a Google search we get from searching the input. We get that from the very simple trim_text and search_and_scrape functions that look like this:

```

def search_and_scrape(query):
    try:
        headers = {
            ""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3""
        }
        url = f""https://www.google.com/search?q={query}""
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
            text = soup.get_text()
            cleaned_text = ' '.join(text.split())
            return cleaned_text
        else:
            print(f""Failed to fetch search results for query: {query}, status code: {response.status_code}"")
            return None

    except Exception as e:
        print(f""Error fetching search results for query: {query}, error: {e}"")
        return None

def trim_text(text, start_index = 450, length=1500):
    return text[start_index:start_index + length]
```

The query agent has this system message:

```
{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You answer a user's question, given some text as context to help\
answer the question. The user request will be followed by the context. The context given is\
from the user's Google search results, it is current and up to date.\
Do not contradict the contents of the given text in your answer.""}
```

And that’s it. You can change the cutoff threshold or get more sophisticated with fetching web results. I hope you find this useful."

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

Hi, I’m currently a 3rd year software engineering student, and a frontend engineer in work.

Seeing all the recent advancements in machine learning and ai in general (especially with chatGPT), I think it is inevitable to learn how everything works and how to develop in this field.

I have some good knowledge of programming, system architecture and computer science fundamentals.  As well as decent knowledge on various programming languages, algorithms and design patterns.

My question is, where can I start to learn ML the fastest way possible, knowing already a lot about python and programming in general?

Where can I learn only what’s necessary for developing a product for the industry in ML? (if it’s possible to skip all the theoretical stuff)

Also, Is statistics really that necessary for industry work? I have some decent knowledge about math from university but in real life I rarely use linear algebra or calculus in work (since I don’t do graphics or anything related to that)."

I wanted to give a sophisticated chatbot like ChatGPT a bunch of data and text from (for instance, not my end goal) a philosopher, and have it answer questions as if it was that philosopher, ague against what I say as if it was a person who believed what the text I gave it said and so on, all while still able to use online resources (like ChatGPT does) to find additional supporting information, rather than only the text I give it which might limit its ability to give coherent arguments. In summary, I want it's beliefs  and values to be limited to a specific source text, but not it's knowledge base.

How would I go about this? Do I have to develop a model from scratch to give it any text sources I want, or is it possible to do with an existing API? I was going to use Character.AI but the method for giving it information is too limited for what I want to do.

**TLDR:**

Looking for ML buddies at any level (preferably beginners) who want to start freelancing together. The goal is to build a small local community of ML enthusiasts who can support each other and exchange knowledge. We will use freelance collaboration as our main activity. We're also looking for experienced mentors (paid or unpaid) to guide us.

**Extended:**

I believe that learning and growing in a group is much more enjoyable and effective. That's why I'm trying to create a community of like-minded individuals.

I'm looking to create a small, local community for people who are starting out in freelancing, and who are interested in mutual support. Our main activity will be a Discord channel where members can post their work and collaborate on projects, with payment split by agreement. Additionally, we plan to engage in activities such as knowledge exchange, live coding, supporting each other's pet projects, and hosting study sessions.

This community will be small and focused, with members who can trust each other and share similar goals. We're also looking for experienced mentors who can provide guidance as we navigate the world of ML freelancing. Whether paid or unpaid, we welcome any support and advice.

About me: I'm a 21-year-old self-taught ML enthusiast from Russia. Although I don't have any experience in freelancing, I'm eager to start taking my first steps towards making money and gaining experience. As a beginner, I'm hoping to connect with others who are at a similar level and are also looking to grow.

I am speaking from the point of view of a data scientist not working in research.

Until now, learning NLP could be used to meet occasional business needs like sentiment analysis, text classification, topic modeling....

With the opening of GPT-3 to the public, the rise of ChatGPT, and the huge wave of applications, sites, plug-ins and extensions based on this technology that are accessible with a simple API request, it's impossible not to wonder if spending dozens of hours diving into this field if ML wouldn't be as useful today as learning the source code of the Pandas library. 

In some specialized cases, it could be useful, but GPT-3, and the models that will follow, seem to offer more than sufficient results for the immensity of the cases and for almost all classical NLP tasks. Not only that, but there is a good chance that the models trained by giants like Open-AI (Microsoft) or Google can never be replicated outside these companies anyway.  With ChatGPT and its incomparable mastery of language, its ability to code, summarize, extract topics, understand... why would I bother to use BERT or a TF-IDF vectorizer when an API will be released? Not only it would be easily accessible, but it also would be much better at the task, faster and cheaper.

In fact, it's a concern regarding all the machine learning field in general with the arrival of powerful ""no-code"" applications, which abstract a large part of the inherent complexity of the field. There will always be a need for experts, for safeguards, but in the end, won't the Data Scientist who masters the features of GPT-3 or 4 and knows a bit of NLP be more efficient than the one who has spent hours reading Google papers and practicing on Gensim, NLTK, spacy... It is the purpose of an API to make things simpler eventually... At what point is there no more reason to be interested in the behind-the-scenes of these tools and to become simple users rather than trying to develop our own techniques?"

Hi, I’m currently a 3rd year software engineering student, and a frontend engineer in work.

Seeing all the recent advancements in machine learning and ai in general (especially with chatGPT), I think it is inevitable to learn how everything works and how to develop in this field.

I have some good knowledge of programming, system architecture and computer science fundamentals.  As well as decent knowledge on various programming languages, algorithms and design patterns.

My question is, where can I start to learn ML the fastest way possible, knowing already a lot about python and programming in general?

Where can I learn only what’s necessary for developing a product for the industry in ML? (if it’s possible to skip all the theoretical stuff)

Also, Is statistics really that necessary for industry work? I have some decent knowledge about math from university but in real life I rarely use linear algebra or calculus in work (since I don’t do graphics or anything related to that)."

I'm excited to share my latest article about a new open-source technology called OpenChatKit.

For those who work in NLP, you're probably familiar with ChatGPT - a powerful language model that can perform various natural language processing tasks. However, ChatGPT is not open-source, which limits its accessibility and customizability.

OpenChatKit, on the other hand, is an open-source alternative to ChatGPT that provides users with similar NLP capabilities while allowing for more customization and control. With OpenChatKit, users can train their own models and fine-tune them to their specific use cases.

In my article, I dive into the features of OpenChatKit, the Instruction-tuned Large Language Model, and the Limitations of the Model.

If you're interested in learning more about OpenChatKit and how it can enhance your NLP workflows, check out my article [OpenChatKit: Open-Source ChatGPT Alternative ](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/03/openchatkit-opensource-chatgpt-alternative.html).

Is SEO really dead? Or will it evolve? Back then I kept wondering if it’s true or not. Some believe SEO is dead, some don’t. But now with tools like Chat GPT and Midjourney, I think it’s time to take a look back and see how this might change SEO or if it will “kill” SEO.

I keep seeing threads and discussions seeing how people are excited and worried at the same time with how AI might be able to do a better job. But the way I see it, AI content still needs a person to tell it what to do and make the writing look nice. And also I think that the internet will have a lot of writing that was made by AI and that might change how we find things online. You might also see a ton of content being written by AI and trigger some plagiarism detectors and have a lot of websites get penalized. Hopefully the internet won’t be filled with boilerplate copy/pasted content coming from Chat GPT.

Well we have Google to filter out trash content anyway. But I know Google has some issues lately that they need to fix. One is that they also have AI that can help people find things on the internet with their search engine, and they need to make sure they are still the best in terms of search. 

The second is that Google needs to find a way to tell if something is really good or not, like how some websites that show art do. Google wants to show the best thing first, but it's hard because sometimes the thing that is the best is also something that Google's customers want people to see. It’s possible that some AI generated contentSo it's kind of tricky.

I have a feeling companies that already make SEO-writing and checking bots are gonna roll out some fresh new models soon. They're gonna be even better than before. These bots are going to write some good articles and product descriptions that are almost perfect. It almost looks like a human wrote the article or description. And all a human will do is quickly check for any false claims and write a headline that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it. 

We can only really tell 5-10 years from now. In the meantime, I’ll probably go back practicing some handyman skills and also go back teaching people how to drive and also be a service driver. These jobs I had in the past were way different from what I am earning now but if the worst comes to worst, at least I have these physical skills ready."

IT is a very long conversation, i apologize.

As far as i can tell there is no way to access previous bing chats again...


Now, theres propably some errors in it, but what i want to know is, is this a viable approach, is the picture it created in my head accurate enough to at least have somewhat of an opinion about things?

remember, before i talked to it I had no idea about how LLMs actually work. I had heard of parameters of transformer, of neurons but that was about it, I didnt knew what these words actually stood for.


Now mind you, my goal wasnt to get a deep scientific understanding so that i can build my own models. I wanted to end up with a valid general overview of the technology so that i can build somehwat(!) of an imformed opinion about what is about to come. Would you say this ended up successfully?

im also trying to assess how valuable this process is for other things i diont know yet. Will I / Can I in the future just talk to the bot for a few hours to get an understanding of $new instead of googling and sifting through crap?

I'd love to hear your thoughts:

Vinyl Chloride spilled in East Palestine, Ohio about 300 miles away from Cincinnati. The chemical leaked into the Ohio River. How long will it take for the chemical to reach the water supply of Cincinnati which is also on the Ohio River?

The time it will take for Vinyl Chloride to reach Cincinnati's water supply from the spill site in East Palestine, Ohio will depend on several factors such as the amount of Vinyl Chloride spilled, the concentration of the chemical in the river, the flow rate of the river, and any barriers or dams along the river that may affect the movement of the chemical.

Assuming there are no significant barriers or dams along the river, the average flow rate of the Ohio River is approximately 1.5 miles per hour. Therefore, if the spill occurred in East Palestine, Ohio, which is 300 miles upstream from Cincinnati, it could take up to 200 hours (300 miles / 1.5 miles per hour) for the Vinyl Chloride to reach Cincinnati's water supply.

However, it is important to note that the actual time for the chemical to reach Cincinnati's water supply could be longer or shorter depending on the specific conditions of the spill and the river. It's also possible that officials may take steps to prevent the chemical from reaching the water supply, such as by diverting the river or shutting off water intake valves, in order to protect public health and safety.

Github here: https://github.com/sgreenb/pico_assistant

One extremally simple modification that dramatically improves the ability of a GPT to answer questions: letting it Google stuff.

Here’s a demo:

https://imgur.com/ZR6hvLg 1

The implementation works like this.

1. A user enters an input.
2. An agent called “Executive” looks at the input and decides if an API like Spotify, Twillio, or Gmail is needed or if it can be answered by the chatbot alone.
3. If the chatbot is needed the input is first sent to a Google agent. The Google agent’s system message looks like this:

```
{""role"":""system"", ""content"": ""You analyze a user's input to a large language model with \
training data that cuts off at September 2021. The current year is 2023. You decide how \
likely it is that a user's request will benefit from a Google search to help address the\
question. Respond with a number in the range 1-10, where 1 is very unlikely that a \
Google search would be beneficial, and 10 meaning a Google search is highly necessary.""}
```

This is quite fast, since it only needs to generate one or two tokens.

If the output is above some threshold (say 7), then we call another agent, the query agent, otherwise we return False and default to the normal chat agent.

```
    google_probability = int(completion.choices[0].message.content)
    if google_probability >= cutoff:
        search_results = trim_text(search_and_scrape(prompt))
        query_with_context = prompt + str(search_results)
        print(""\nPico: "", end='', flush=True)
        response = query_agent_stream(query_with_context)
        return response
    else:
        return False
```

When we call the query agent, we feed it the first part of a Google search we get from searching the input. We get that from the very simple trim_text and search_and_scrape functions that look like this:

```

def search_and_scrape(query):
    try:
        headers = {
            ""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3""
        }
        url = f""https://www.google.com/search?q={query}""
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 200:

The query agent has this system message:

```

answer the question. The user request will be followed by the context. The context given is\
from the user's Google search results, it is current and up to date.\

```

And that’s it. You can change the cutoff threshold or get more sophisticated with fetching web results. I hope you find this useful."

I'm excited to share my latest article about a new open-source technology called OpenChatKit.

For those who work in NLP, you're probably familiar with ChatGPT - a powerful language model that can perform various natural language processing tasks. However, ChatGPT is not open-source, which limits its accessibility and customizability.

OpenChatKit, on the other hand, is an open-source alternative to ChatGPT that provides users with similar NLP capabilities while allowing for more customization and control. With OpenChatKit, users can train their own models and fine-tune them to their specific use cases.

In my article, I dive into the features of OpenChatKit, the Instruction-tuned Large Language Model, and the Limitations of the Model.

If you're interested in learning more about OpenChatKit and how it can enhance your NLP workflows, check out my article [OpenChatKit: Open-Source ChatGPT Alternative ](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/03/openchatkit-opensource-chatgpt-alternative.html).

My use case involves text data with descriptions so it won’t be applicable in every situation, but it can definitely give inspiration to anyone.

I had podcast transcripts that were chunked into sections (\~3000 text documents). These sections were then transformed into summaries with [LangChain](https://langchain.com/) and [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction). Finally, I embedded the summaries using OpenAI embeddings. Then I ran KMeans (k=30) and got labels with section names:

In order to avoid exceeding the maximal number of tokens in the context window (4096 tokens), I sampled the data frame to contain 200 segment names with 5 selected labels. Then I iteratively moved to the next labels, i.e.:

1. iteration — labels from 0 to 4

* 2. iteration — labels from 5 to 9
* …
* 6. iteration — labels from 25 to 29

This is an example output from our ontology detector:

After iterating through all labels I noticed that some of the categories and keywords overlap. Moreover, it would be hard to navigate through so many categories.

That’s why I asked ChatGPT to group overlapping categories:

I wrote a deep dive on prompt engineering as a resource for the AI community and my 10,000 daily newsletter subscribers ([Inclined.ai](https://www.inclined.ai/p/prompt-engineering-guide) if you're curious). We've included some examples so feel free to copy and paste the prompts into ChatGPT!

&#x200B;

**WHAT IS PROMPT ENGINEERING?**

The term is relatively new, and its origins are argued *(because we live in the internet age, and it’s harder to claim ownership)*. Prompt engineering is the ability to instruct and teach AI effectively.

If it helps, think of this as rapid testing or instruction writing for artificial intelligence.

What’s important is not to let this overwhelm you. The first prompting happened with the first AI model. The first example was showing computer images of circles and triangles. **Today’s neural networks can process way more data, creating complexities.**

So, the concept is simple, but digging into the full power of AI today is something else entirely.

We’re not talking about asking questions. Odds are, if you’re typing *“what’s 2+2”* into ChatGPT, then you need to keep reading.

We can all ask chatbots questions. That can work more often than not. But AI is not perfect. A common metaphor I see is to treat GPT-based large language models like the smartest five-year-old you’ve ever met.

I have a niece around that age and can’t imagine trying to get her to write an essay on the effects of soil mismanagement in relation to Reconstruction politics. *See! Your eyes glazed over reading that, so how do we make this work for our AI buddies?*

The Principles of Prompting

Stop asking single-line questions. *That’s like using a top-rated cookbook to find out how to make grilled cheese.*

**There are three ways to instantly get better at prompting** and go from grilled cheese to top-notch bolognese. From there, we can get into some specific prompt concepts and the ability to unlock ChatGPT’s full potential.

Principle 1: Context is King

GPT-3.5 is swimming in data. When you ask it for a simple request, it can end up complicating things more than you realize. Did you ever wonder why ChatGPT is so bad at math?

The reality is the LLM is taking words and turning them into patterns. From there, it’s making an educated guess.

Give your chat AI a frame to search into. If you give it a math problem, you need to make sure it grasps that you want it to do math. If you’d like ChatGPT to write a high school essay, you must ensure it knows to write at that level.

**Instead of:** “Plan a party for a kid.”

**Try:** “My child is turning 9. They like superheroes and the color red. Help me plan a party for this weekend. Ten of his friends are coming to my house.”

You’ll get a much better response this way. **Context is the cardinal direction** that helps your chat companion find the most correct guess and phrase it the best way.

Principle 2: Get Specific

Pretend you’re writing a law that’s going to be judged by the Supreme Court of the United States. You know what they look for: narrow tailoring.

**Keep things on track and stay focused.** Try to avoid prompting outside the specific request. You’ll only hurt the ability of the chat AI to give you a quality response. Odds are they’ll even skip over parts if you confuse them with too many requests.

It runs parallel with context. *If you set ChatGPT up in a room and then tell it to focus on describing the chair first, you’ll see better results.*

**Instead of:** “I’m going to a job interview. Write five questions for me to answer. Add tips for how to not get nervous before the interview. Do not create questions asking about my background.”

**Try:** “You’re interviewing a software engineer. Create five questions to ask them to understand their skill set and qualifications better.”

Nothing limits the number of prompts you can do. Focus and expand from the initial request and try not to do everything at once.

Principle 3: When in Doubt: “Let’s take this step-by-step.”

Welcome. **You discovered the magic word today.** This phrase slows everything down for the AI and gets you where you need to go.

You don’t need to start with this phrase. Using it tells ChatGPT to show their work.

We’ll explain where this concept comes from further in our briefing, but here’s the TL;DR: sometimes, there’s a part of our prompt it’s not identified correctly. “Let’s take this step-by-step,” reminds you and ChatGPT to **slow down and get specific.**

If you learn to utilize this phrase more often and find ways to make it work for you, you’ll become a better prompt engineer. One term can do a lot of heavy lifting.

**Pro-tip:** We’ve shown you “standard” prompts in all these examples. Many prompt engineers will use “Standard QA form” prompts. Here’s our example for this principle written that way.

**Example:**

*“Q: The Industrial Revolution rapidly changed the infrastructure in London. Describe three essential innovations from this period and connect them to Landon’s development.*

*A: Let’s take this step-by-step.”*

Even without our magic word, this style of standard prompting is quite helpful to adopt.

*However, we’re beginning to stumble into the advanced tactics used in prompt engineering, so it’s time for a new section.*

UNIQUE WAYS TO PROMPT

Let’s preface this: we can go super deep here. Prompt engineering is changing daily, and as these models get more sophisticated, the need to adapt prompts strengthens.

To keep things clean, I will go through these using our metaphor from earlier. **Let’s pretend ChatGPT is a super-intelligent toddler.**

*Got it? With that buy-in, we can continue.*

1/ Role Prompting

We’ll start with a popular tactic. **Our toddler is great at imagining things.** You tell them they’re a fireman, and suddenly they can give you detailed ways to ensure your apartment is up to code. Role-playing is a fun, easy way to build context.

The best part of role prompting is how easy it is to understand and use. All you need to do is tell ChatGPT to play a role. From there, the AI will do its best to fill the part *like that enthusiastic drama student from your old high school.*

You can even take this a step further. **Try framing your prompt as a script.** Tell the LLM specific instructions around a scene that gives you the answer to your question.

TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF:

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT and find a destination!

“Act as a travel guide. I will tell you my location and you will suggest a place to visit near my location. In some cases, I will also give you the type of places I will visit. You will also suggest me places of similar type that are close to my first location. My first suggestion: \[fill it in\]”

Why would you take that extra step? While popular, role prompting does not necessarily improve accuracy. *You can tell your five-year-old they’re a mathematician, and they’ll still manage to screw things up.*

Let’s get deeper.

2/ Chain-of-Thought Prompting

There’s a scene in ***Guardians of the Galaxy*** where Rocket Raccoon is trying to [teach young Groot](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3lvdXR1LmJlL0hyaW1mZ2pmNGs4IiwicG9zdF9pZCI6ImM0ODlmMzhkLTY3NDAtNGRmNS05MWJjLTM1ODA0YTVmNTZkMiIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiNjNkODQ2ZGUtZDFiZi00ZTVjLWJjYzgtOWMxYzlkMWIxMjA0IiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiJkZWRiNmMyNy1hYmM0LTQ5ZDUtYWM2Ny04OTcyZmM1MGVmM2QiLCJpYXQiOjE2NzY5MTkwNjguMTUyLCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.5eZkDLGRLCXXYv32FYT7kLSbdRK5OK1iemTRf3HVmJw)

how to activate a complicated device. That’s chain-of-thought prompting.

**You take an example question and answer it for ChatGPT.** Show them your chain of thought. Then you give it a new question in the same vein and ask it for an answer.

This prompt style allows you to get more specific. You’re telling your toddler they’re here to answer this particular question with one specific logic pattern.

Within this specific style is two other sub-categories. Let me give the rundown:

* Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought is “Let’s take this step-by-step” you frame the question the same, but don’t give it a precursor. Instead, you ask it to think through the points made. EX: Q: X is A. Y is B. What is C? A: Let’s take this step-by-step.
* Self-consistency is using several responses to find the most accurate answer. You give ChatGPT more swings at the ball. Take the hits and discover the grouping.

TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF:

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT and see how accurate it is:

“Q: Which is a faster way to get home?

Option 1: Take an 10 minutes bus, then an 40 minute bus, and finally a 10 minute train.

Option 2: Take a 90 minutes train, then a 45 minute bike ride, and finally a 10 minute bus.

A: Option 1 will take 10+40+10 = 60 minutes.

Option 2 will take 90+45+10=145 minutes.

Since Option 1 takes 60 minutes and Option 2 takes 145 minutes, Option 1 is faster.

Q: Which is a faster way to get to work?

Option 1: Take a 1000 minute bus, then a half hour train, and finally a 10 minute bike ride.

Option 2: Take an 800 minute bus, then an hour train, and finally a 30 minute bike ride.

A: ”

\- by leaving the “A:” blank you’re prompting ChatGPT for the answer

Alright, you’re almost there—one more to go.

3/ General Knowledge Prompting

You’re going to notice a trend here. This prompt style also circles context and narrow tailoring.

All you do is tell your toddler how the world works. The cow goes moo. The dog goes woof. So what does a cat say?

It’s an oversimplification, but the core reasoning is there. Show ChatGPT some knowledge and turn that into the only focus for that chat. You can take an article from the internet and summarize it for the model. Make sure to ask if it understands and relay the information to you.

Once you know you have the attention set in the suitable space, get to work. For instance, we can share an Inclined newsletter with it and tell ChatGPT about its structure and tone.

From there, you can provide new information and tell ChatGPT to summarize it within the same structure as Inclined. You both share the same general knowledge now.

TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF:

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT and test it out:

“Prompt 1. Look over this article here: \[pick an article\]. Breakdown its structure and general tone.

Prompt 2: Recall the structure and tone you mentioned above. Take that general knowledge and summarize this article: \[pick a new one\] using the same structure and tone.”

Note: this is a heavily simplified version of GA Prompting

Did you know some [people don’t consider](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3MueWNvbWJpbmF0b3IuY29tL2l0ZW0_aWQ9MzQ0OTU0NTUiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiYzQ4OWYzOGQtNjc0MC00ZGY1LTkxYmMtMzU4MDRhNWY1NmQyIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI2M2Q4NDZkZS1kMWJmLTRlNWMtYmNjOC05YzFjOWQxYjEyMDQiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImRlZGI2YzI3LWFiYzQtNDlkNS1hYzY3LTg5NzJmYzUwZWYzZCIsImlhdCI6MTY3NjkxOTA2OC4xNTMsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.yHKIPujINT89tsqOo07AXk6OrKNgoMjO3fBEYPkAdNY)

that prompt engineering?

PROMPT CULTURE

*“How can something not be prompt engineering if it’s a prompt style?”*

Good question, imaginary reader. The culture around this skill is relatively fresh. So some of **these concepts are seen as too easy** to be considered accurate prompt testing.

General knowledge prompting is simply establishing the context, and for some, that’s a baseline everyone needs to do. The same can be said for role prompting, too. *All of these tiny preferences are semantics.*

**Don’t sweat whether you’re a “real” prompt engineer.** Test this out and share your insights in these communities. The opportunity is there for you.

You may even know about DAN (we’ve covered it in previous newsletters) and other AI hacking methods. Those all start with prompt engineering. You can make the case that unless the AI behaves outside its parameters, you’re not genuinely doing prompt engineering.

I'm afraid I have to disagree with that, and **careers are sprouting up everywhere** that center directly on this skill. **Many require a core understanding of the prompt styles we’ve discussed.**

*Yep, you can learn this and make money from talking with AI.*

Anthropic even [posted a role for a prompt engineer](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2pvYnMubGV2ZXIuY28vQW50aHJvcGljL2UzY2RlNDgxLWQ0NDYtNDYwZi1iNTc2LTkzY2FiNjdiZDFlZCIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiJjNDg5ZjM4ZC02NzQwLTRkZjUtOTFiYy0zNTgwNGE1ZjU2ZDIiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjYzZDg0NmRlLWQxYmYtNGU1Yy1iY2M4LTljMWM5ZDFiMTIwNCIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiZGVkYjZjMjctYWJjNC00OWQ1LWFjNjctODk3MmZjNTBlZjNkIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc2OTE5MDY4LjE1MywiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.4s7Htzgoxv0_qM1Ten17oQ5h0_QGM6e1fGUYz_ymgJ4)

that nets a quarter million in salary. I did not make that up and even considered sprucing up the old resume. When a new skill like this comes about, it’s worth looking at.

There are many other examples like this, and OpenAI uses a red teaming strategy where their engineers attempt to prompt hack their own GPT models.

I can tell you all about the open roles here, but tomorrow the whole cycle will change. *Isn’t that exciting, though?* The entire identity around prompt engineering will change by this time next year.

WHAT SHOULD YOU TAKEAWAY?

Communication is everything. **Learning to speak with AI is rising in importance.**

We all watch with mouth agape at the new wonders in AI because we know this will disrupt every industry. If any of this piqued your interest, the window to pursue it is now open. Ride that wave and [learn](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2xlYXJucHJvbXB0aW5nLm9yZy8iLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiYzQ4OWYzOGQtNjc0MC00ZGY1LTkxYmMtMzU4MDRhNWY1NmQyIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI2M2Q4NDZkZS1kMWJmLTRlNWMtYmNjOC05YzFjOWQxYjEyMDQiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImRlZGI2YzI3LWFiYzQtNDlkNS1hYzY3LTg5NzJmYzUwZWYzZCIsImlhdCI6MTY3NjkxOTA2OC4xNTMsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.a67KDSN9yQfZsaMeHpdcbSbtPjD4yFcGW4stdxBjX1M)

I'd love to hear your thoughts:

Vinyl Chloride spilled in East Palestine, Ohio about 300 miles away from Cincinnati. The chemical leaked into the Ohio River. How long will it take for the chemical to reach the water supply of Cincinnati which is also on the Ohio River?

The time it will take for Vinyl Chloride to reach Cincinnati's water supply from the spill site in East Palestine, Ohio will depend on several factors such as the amount of Vinyl Chloride spilled, the concentration of the chemical in the river, the flow rate of the river, and any barriers or dams along the river that may affect the movement of the chemical.

Assuming there are no significant barriers or dams along the river, the average flow rate of the Ohio River is approximately 1.5 miles per hour. Therefore, if the spill occurred in East Palestine, Ohio, which is 300 miles upstream from Cincinnati, it could take up to 200 hours (300 miles / 1.5 miles per hour) for the Vinyl Chloride to reach Cincinnati's water supply.

However, it is important to note that the actual time for the chemical to reach Cincinnati's water supply could be longer or shorter depending on the specific conditions of the spill and the river. It's also possible that officials may take steps to prevent the chemical from reaching the water supply, such as by diverting the river or shutting off water intake valves, in order to protect public health and safety.

I thought there are tons of applications for this, so [I created a workshop](https://app.livestorm.co/xethub/mygpt-free-workshop-build-a-chatgpt-clone-tailored-to-your-data?type=detailed&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=openaireddit) so you can create your own app - I’m calling it “MyGPT”.  


In this workshop I’ll be covering:

* How to create a Generative AI app using the DaVinci model (the same one used by ChatGPT) 
* How a Generative AI application is structured (the tech stack)
* Integrating your own data into a Large Language Model (LLM)
* Getting started with XetHub (similar to GitHub but easier for ML models)
* Create a Python app that uses Gradio & LangChain

I just wanted to share a simple chat window that I created using ChatGPT. You can find the link to the Github repository here: [https://github.com/gnuconcepts/ChatWindowGPT](https://github.com/gnuconcepts/ChatWindowGPT)

This one-file script allows you to keep track of conversations and logs them locally. I created this because I wanted an alternative way to access ChatGPT when the website is overloaded, and didn't want to shell out $20/month for it.

Check out the short Youtube video I created to see it in action: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nWr4qRzmWA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nWr4qRzmWA). Thanks for checking it out, and please let me know if you have any feedback or questions!"

\- I wanted to see if I could use ChatGPT (v4) to make a Streamlit Tic Tac Toe App. The stipulation was no touching of the code, only prompting. I was able to do it, and the key lesson was to be clear in what you want from ChatGPT. If you don't ask it explicitly, it might not do what a human would normally produce. For example, I had to ask ChatGPT to use X and O's as markers. Otherwise, the code used 1's and 2's.  
\- Show me the app: [https://datadote-llm-tictactoe-tic-tac-toe-streamlit-va0zww.streamlit.app/](https://datadote-llm-tictactoe-tic-tac-toe-streamlit-va0zww.streamlit.app/)

\- Github: [https://github.com/Datadote/llm\_TicTacToe](https://github.com/Datadote/llm_TicTacToe)

\- I'm happy to any questions. I'm a beginner, and this whole process took \~1.5 hrs. If I knew what I waas doing, it could've been faster. I spent less than 10 minutes looking at the actual code. Most of it was copy/pasting, checking the GUI result, and modifying the prompt."
