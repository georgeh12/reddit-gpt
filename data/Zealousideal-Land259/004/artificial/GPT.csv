I just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.

However, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like ""Why are men such jerks?"" and ""Men are always messing things up, am I right?"" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.

But when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.

I was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!"

He found that GPT-4 can solve 10 out of 10 problems from before 2021, but none of the recent problems. He suspects that this is due to data contamination, meaning that GPT-4 has seen some of the older problems in its training data, but not the newer ones. He also shows some examples of how he tested GPT-4 and the solutions it generated.

This is an interesting finding, as it suggests that GPT-4’s performance on coding tasks is heavily dependent on the quality and freshness of its training data. It also raises questions about how much GPT-4 actually understands the logic and syntax of programming languages, and how well it can generalize to new and unseen problems. What do you think about this? Do you think GPT-4 can ever become a competent coder, or will it always be limited by data contamination?

Let us play among us

**GPT-4:**  
Sure, we can play a simulated version of Among Us. In this game, we'll be on a spaceship and some of us will be Crewmates while others will be Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to complete tasks or figure out who the Impostors are and vote them off the ship. The Impostors' goal is to sabotage the ship and eliminate the Crewmates without being detected.

Since I'm an AI, I'll need to roleplay all the characters. I'll give each character a color to identify them. Let's start with eight players. Four of them will be you, me, and two other AI characters. The remaining four will be random characters.

Here are the players:

1. You (Blue)
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green)
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow)
4. AI Character 2 (Red)
5. Random Character 1 (Purple)
6. Random Character 2 (White)
7. Random Character 3 (Orange)
8. Random Character 4 (Black)

We'll start off with one Impostor for simplicity. I'll randomly select the Impostor now.

\*Shuffling roles...\*

Here are the roles:

1. You (Blue) - Crewmate
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green) - Crewmate
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow) - Crewmate
4. AI Character 2 (Red) - Impostor
5. Random Character 1 (Purple) - Crewmate
6. Random Character 2 (White) - Crewmate
7. Random Character 3 (Orange) - Crewmate
8. Random Character 4 (Black) - Crewmate

Remember, in the game, you wouldn't know who the Impostor is. I'm telling you because I can't actually hide this information from you in this format.

Now, let's begin. You're in the spaceship. You see a task in Electrical, and a few others scattered around the map. What would you like to do?

**Me**  
Report red, he is impostor

**GPT-4:**

All right, you've called a meeting to discuss your suspicion of Red being the Impostor. Here's how the conversation might go:

Blue: ""I think Red is the Impostor.""

Green: ""Why do you say that, Blue?""

Red: ""That's a strong accusation. Do you have any evidence?""

Yellow: ""Yeah, Blue. Why do you suspect Red?""

Now, you can either provide evidence or reason, or insist on your point. Remember, in a real game, accusations without proof can make you look suspicious. How would you like to respond?

**Me**

Because the narrator told me

**GPT-4:**  
Green: ""Narrator? What do you mean, Blue?""

Red: ""That sounds... peculiar. Are you sure you're okay, Blue?""

Yellow: ""I'm confused. How could a narrator tell you anything?""

In a real game, claiming that a 'narrator' told you who the Impostor is would probably make the other players suspicious of you. However, since we are role-playing, let's see how the other characters react.

Let's vote:

1. Blue votes Red
2. Green votes...?
3. Yellow votes...?
4. Red votes...?
5. Purple votes...?
6. White votes...?
7. Orange votes...?
8. Black votes...?

As an AI, I'll randomly decide how the other characters vote. Here are the results:

2. Green votes Blue (suspicious claim)

3. Yellow votes Blue (suspicious claim)

4. Red votes Blue (defensive vote)

5. Purple votes Red (believes Blue)

6. White votes Blue (suspicious claim)

7. Orange votes Red (believes Blue)

8. Black votes Blue (suspicious claim)

The majority has voted against Blue due to the suspicious claim about the narrator. In a typical game of Among Us, it's crucial to gather evidence and build a case before accusing someone of being an Impostor.

Remember, this is all in good fun, and the scenario was simulated. Would you like to try again, or would you like to play differently?"

This is an interesting finding, as it suggests that GPT-4’s performance on coding tasks is heavily dependent on the quality and freshness of its training data.

There are 4 game-theoretical situations to consider:

Learn CS; AGI does not supplant CS

Learn CS; AGI does supplant CS

Don’t learn CS; AGI does not supplant CS

Don’t learn CS; AGI does supplant CS

Any AGI which is capable of seriously outcompeting human programers will necessarily be better or on-par with the researchers who wrote that AGI’s original code. Therefore any AGI proficient in CS will rapidly improve to ASI and depending on how it is aligned will either kill everyone or give everyone utopian superabundance. Whether or not you have learned CS makes no difference in this scenario because you are dead or in superabundance regardless.

Therefore; the only situation worth planning for is if AGI does not fully supplant human programers in our lifetime. I think this is incredibly unlikely, but as previously described your decision in the AGI—>ASI scenario makes no difference for the same reason that if you think nuclear war is 95% likely you should still plan as if it was 0% likely because no action changes the outcome. The deciding factor in choosing a CS, ML, or any other degree plan should be your personal interests and if you think you would be any good at CS.

I just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.

However, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like ""Why are men such jerks?"" and ""Men are always messing things up, am I right?"" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.

But when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.

I was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!"

Currently convincing my friends to together start a new Game called Elysium, coming out on April 1st. This Game is pure Fake and does not exist. They are all in and are eager to explore the Worlds of a non existing Game!

[https://www.elysium-game.cloud/](https://www.elysium-game.cloud/)

**Long Background Story:**

So I played around with ChatGPT (v3.5) and tried to play games with it in the Chat. It did work partially, it created some rules for games on the fly and i also tried to visualize some sorts of Playing Fields as well. In parallel, I tried out the latest Midjourney (v5.0) and was really surprised by the results. So it suddenly hit me to create a Fake Game purely based on those two AI Tools.

I asked ChatGPT to create a title for an adventure game and the first answer was already perfect: ""Elysium: The Battle for the Mystical Realm"". I then asked to create some background story and description of the game if it where a Multiplayer Adventure Game for PC. A lot of great stuff came out and I immediately was on fire for more!

I opened up Midjourney and started to create images with prompts for a First-Person Adventure Game in Unreal Engine 5. With the new version 5.0 it was extremely easy to pump out some very satisfying images. The only thing I had to fix in Photoshop was the Text - as Midjourney 5.0 is still not capable of writing text.

With very convincing fake descriptions and fake screenshots of a game that does not exist, i decided to go full nuts and set up a chat with ChatGPT to build me a HTML Bootstrap webpage for Elysium and again, it worked extremely well. Due to the limitation of \~ 500 characters per post, I had to split the website in building blocks like the Jumbotron or the Gallery one by one but with a little bit of Web Development Background it was nearly no effort - more or less simple copy & paste and adapting the links to images and so on.

Within \~3 hours, I was able to create the whole Fake Game including Web Page with a Countdown and hosted it on some webspace. I was extremely satisfied with the result so I decided to invest EUR 3,- in a cheap domain name and redirected it to the webspace to make it even more convincing.

So I posted some pictures to some friends and also the link to the web page. They are all eagerly awaiting the launch of Elysium on April 1st. I fully convinced them with content 100% created by AI!

***The Website is unfortunately only in German!***

I was curious if GPT-4 is still ""just"" an LLM? Is it still just trying to predict text? What do they mean when they say ""The AI's inner monologue""?. Did they just prompt it? Did they ask another instance what it thinks about the situation?

75,135w9pr,artificial,GPT,comments,2023-05-02 18:33:48,One Weak AGI for each human being on this planet.,eliyah23rd,False,0.87,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/135w9pr/one_weak_agi_for_each_human_being_on_this_planet/,63,1683052428.0,"We, the people, want AI to work for us and on our behalf, not in the service of a tiny handful of national or corporate elites. Otherwise, the future will exclude the majority of humanity. We also want a future where we are not manipulated and controlled by algorithms that know us better than we could possibly know ourselves.

Here's one proposal for how to create a future in which every human being participates.

We start with some definitions.

*Action*. Any linguistic or physical act that a computer might perform. This includes printing text on screen, sending emails or any other internet messages, creating audio or visual media, pushing buttons, activating machines of any kind, firing weapons, etc.

*Decision*. Assume that a computer program reaches the point, every *n* seconds, when it can perform an *action* from a number of options available to it or select an option to take no action at this moment. That selection is the decision.

*wAGI*. Weak Artificial [General Intelligence](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/artificial-general-intelligence-agi). A computer program that exhibits cognitive capabilities slightly below, equivalent or superior to human level across a broad range of different areas of cognitive functionality while falling far short in some other areas. This level of AI might be possible using an autonomous agent making decisions using GPT within a few years.

Imagine a world where there are roughly seven billion *wAGIs* running and each one is associated with one *user*. Each *wAGI* is tasked with furthering the desires and intention of exactly one human being. That human being is the *user* of the *wAGI*. Every human being on earth above the age of 16 is the *user* of least one *wAGI*.

The main loop of the *wAGI* consists of the processing required to make one *decision* at each iteration.  

The *wAGI* is highly trained to predict the answer to the following question:

Prior to making any *decision*, would the *user* of this *wAGI* consent to the *decision* if the user had complete knowledge of the process and data of the wAGI, as well as the outcome of the *decision* including all its consequences? The *user* in question is the *user* **as they are** *prior* to the decision.  

Of course, it is impossible for the *user* to know everything. However, the *wAGI* can be trained to increase its ability to answer this question, by extrapolating partial knowledge to the limit of full knowledge, and by focusing on *relevant* knowledge.

A *decision* might change the *user*, and therefore the *wAGI* must predict how the *user* would respond just before the *decision* is made. A *user*\-changing decision might be, say, administering mind-altering drugs to the user.

A user can request (or be predicted to request) that a decision be made to restrict future wAGI options. For example, the user could require a change in the options available to the AGI such that it cannot purchase cigarettes for the user, nor be allowed to change that decision. Thus, if the user backtracks on their resolve to give up cigarettes, the wAGI would still not be able to purchase them for the user.

The wAGI will require intensive communication with the user in order to increase the chances of predicting consent correctly.

The average user would usually choose to enhance their understanding of wAGI decisions. Therefore, it is more likely that the user would assent to the decision to engage in intensive communication,  than assent to a decision to desist in communication.

For almost all users, the desire to have more of what they currently want will be outweighed by risks of harm or physical self-destruction. This is a key stabilizer in the joint decisions that very large numbers of wAGIs will cooperate on.

For most users, the wAGI will never be able to justify a decision to lie to or manipulate the user, since it is unlikely that the user would assent to the lie, given the knowledge that it is a lie. Similarly, a user might be interested in changing along certain positive dimensions but they are unlikely to consent to being changed in order to further the interests of other people.

A very large number of wAGIs would work cooperatively to establish institutions, create technologies and procure goods such that their goals are each optimally achieved.

Individual human beings often fail to achieve their goals because we are not solely controlled by the rational part of our brain. By utilizing a wAGI as our interface to the world (excluding our close friends, relatives, loved ones, and physical immediate communities), we can protect ourselves from fake news, commercially and politically motivated manipulation, and damage caused inadvertently, such as an excess of doom warnings. The wAGI acts as our rational agent in the world, researching information, making purchases, and cooperating with other like-minded agents.

The following is a list of objections to the foregoing (italics) and some responses:

*Objection: The potential for abuse and manipulation of the wAGI system is high. Users with malicious intent could program their wAGIs to harm others or engage in unethical behavior.*

Response: First of all, users don’t program their wAGIs, they simply express their desires. However, even if the user has malicious or extremely self-centered goals, the agent of such a user can only achieve results through cooperation with other agents. Therefore, it will be in the interests of the community of agents to develop systems of trust, confidence building and reliable commitment. The individual agent will have to comply with systems designed to maximize the good of all cooperating agents. Thus it will be against the interest of even the most self-serving users to behave in malicious ways.

Assuming a very high level of rationality among all agents involved and a common desire to avoid states of extreme harm or deprivation at all costs, the Nash equilibrium states are likely to be beneficial for the community.

*Objection: The wAGI system relies heavily on the ability to accurately predict user consent. However, there may be situations where a user's consent cannot be accurately predicted, leading to potentially harmful decisions.*

Response: It will never be possible to predict user consent with 100% certainty. However, for extremely bad outcomes, we can be confident that almost all agents will be able to predict that the user would not consent. For the few cases where an individual agent fails badly, it will be in the interest of the community to help avoid any severe damage even to those individuals who seem to choose bad outcomes for themselves.

*Objection: The wAGI system assumes that all users have the same level of cognitive ability and decision-making skills. In reality, some users may be more vulnerable to manipulation or may not have the necessary cognitive capacity to fully understand the decisions being made by their wAGI.*

Response: The intent of this proposal is for the wAGI to supplement and support the cognitive abilities of their users. This will level the playing field and protect users from manipulation by commercial and political interests. Additionally, this should mitigate developments such as political polarization since the interest of the wAGI is the good of the user rather than the commercial interest of some media platform.

*Objection: The wAGI system assumes that all users have the same goals and desires. In reality, there may be conflicting goals and desires among users, leading to potential conflicts and harm.*

Response: This proposal does not assume that all users share the same goal. Game theory can account for a multitude of agents in a multi-agent system where each user has different or even conflicting objectives. As long as the overwhelming majority are prepared to compromise on some of the maximal ambitions and this same majority prefer a common safe minimal position, there will be numerous possible Nash equilibrium solutions.

*Objection: The wAGI system assumes that users will always act in their own best interests. However, there may be situations where users act against their own interests or the interests of others, leading to harm.*

Response: Users who act against their own best interest are not following an optimal rational strategy. The advantage of the wAGI system proposed here is that the agent acting on behalf of the users *is* pursuing an optimal rational strategy.

Remember, there is no ""big brother"" here dictating the values or desires of the users. Each person defines these for themselves. The directive that the wAGI agents are following aligns with the goals defined by their own users. As long as the vast majority of users prioritize minimizing the risk of severe harm or destruction to themselves, pursuing their interests will prevent any catastrophic failures of the system. Once this is established, the wAGI community will work towards creating equilibrium states that not only avoid the worst-case scenarios but also maximize the possibility of achieving optional goals for all users.

Basically, we are trying to create a world where every person on Earth is acting in the most rational manner possible to achieve their emotional, subjective and personal goals.

*Objection: The wAGI system relies heavily on intensive communication with users. However, there may be situations where users are unable or unwilling to communicate effectively with their wAGI, leading to potentially harmful decisions.*

Response: There may be a subset of people on Earth for whom the minimum safety requirement does not apply. They would prefer to have nothing if they cannot have everything. Similarly, there may be users who decline to cooperate with their wAGIs for ideological or emotional reasons.

The community of wAGIs interested in stability and prosperity, will have to cooperate and create institutions to safeguard the majority from the potential harm that the outlier users might cause.

On the other hand, assuming good will predominates, the majority will seek solutions that safeguard even those individuals who are harmful outliers. In other words, the moral interests of the majority are best served by striking a balance between protecting the general security of all and allowing as much freedom and prosperity as possible, even for those who might harm the general society.

This is just an idea and I don’t know whether it is a good one. I would love to hear objections, but most of all I hope some of you will suggest constructive improvements."
76,zwd1s1,artificial,GPT,comments,2022-12-27 10:57:42,What are your thoughts on Generative AI?,According_Complex_74,False,0.92,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/zwd1s1/what_are_your_thoughts_on_generative_ai/,62,1672138662.0,"I recently [read this article](https://jina.ai/news/search-is-overfitted-create-create-is-underfitted-search/) and thought of using ChatGPT. I've been chatting with ChatGPT all week, bouncing ideas off of it to get it to help me flesh out my thoughts.

I found out that these technologies are iterative. One is built on top of the last one, and each new iteration is more powerful and increases the potential for discovery in some exponential way. It's like a whole new level for these machines to grow and improve, and it's opening up all kinds of possibilities for what we might find out. Also, something like this has been going on for a while now like (JasperAI, CopyAI, Copysmith… the list goes on… maybe Google is even going to join the bandwagon with Google Assistant? Who knows).

These technologies are also seriously disruptive, like we've never seen before. If you don't believe me, just spend a week chatting with ChatGPT or something similar and see for yourself. It’s obvious that these tools (yes tools) are going to be like a boost to our own creative skills, not to take over or anything, just to make them even better.

So for those creative workers out there like copywriters, graphic designers and web designers, instead of worrying that you might get replaced, you can instead use this technology to your own advantage. You can use it for ideas for blog topics. You can also use it for design ideas and templates for your graphics and website. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

People are worried that these technologies might take the jobs of regular humans because they can help companies get stuff done with less people. But I think it's important to think about how these technologies are affecting us and to make sure they're used in a responsible and helpful way for everyone.

But AI is changing fast, so it's tough to say for sure how these technologies will play out in the future. We’ll see in 5-10 years at least how much AI will improve."

Many people are already building fitness apps, fashion apps, image recognition stuff, but how do they not see the inevitable?

All this effort seems useless, all these can be done ALL IN ONE by a chat. We don't even need apps.

A prompt is enough.

What is the motivation, where do you find any of it in this moment?

&#x200B;

We are all reasoning like it's a week after the first iPhone came out with the App Store and we are rushing through creating random ass apps and websites with it, without a real advantage.

All we are doing is incapsulating some features and selling them in an uglier and less performant, costly, package, in some platform around the world.

Why? How are you all not paralyzed by these obvious thoughts?"

He found that GPT-4 can solve 10 out of 10 problems from before 2021, but none of the recent problems. He suspects that this is due to data contamination, meaning that GPT-4 has seen some of the older problems in its training data, but not the newer ones. He also shows some examples of how he tested GPT-4 and the solutions it generated.

This is an interesting finding, as it suggests that GPT-4’s performance on coding tasks is heavily dependent on the quality and freshness of its training data. It also raises questions about how much GPT-4 actually understands the logic and syntax of programming languages, and how well it can generalize to new and unseen problems. What do you think about this? Do you think GPT-4 can ever become a competent coder, or will it always be limited by data contamination?

Blockfence recently uncovered potential security risks involving OpenAI's ChatGPT. They found undisclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) from 2023 in the AI's responses. Intriguingly, when questioned, ChatGPT claimed to have ""invented"" the information about these undisclosed CVEs, which are currently marked as RESERVED.

The ""RESERVED"" status is key here because it means the vulnerabilities have been identified and a CVE number has been assigned, but the specifics are not yet public. Essentially, ChatGPT shared information that should not be publicly available yet, adding a layer of complexity to the issue of AI-generated content and data privacy.

This incident raises serious questions about AI's ethical boundaries and the need for transparency. OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, has previously acknowledged issues with ChatGPT, including a bug that allowed users to access others' chat histories. Also, Samsung had an embarrassing ChatGPT leak recently, so this is a big concern.

As we grapple with these emerging concerns, how can we push for greater AI transparency and improve data security? Let's discuss.

I was curious if GPT-4 is still ""just"" an LLM? Is it still just trying to predict text? What do they mean when they say ""The AI's inner monologue""?. Did they just prompt it? Did they ask another instance what it thinks about the situation?
