Currently convincing my friends to together start a new Game called Elysium, coming out on April 1st. This Game is pure Fake and does not exist. They are all in and are eager to explore the Worlds of a non existing Game!

[https://www.elysium-game.cloud/](https://www.elysium-game.cloud/)

**Long Background Story:**

So I played around with ChatGPT (v3.5) and tried to play games with it in the Chat. It did work partially, it created some rules for games on the fly and i also tried to visualize some sorts of Playing Fields as well. In parallel, I tried out the latest Midjourney (v5.0) and was really surprised by the results. So it suddenly hit me to create a Fake Game purely based on those two AI Tools.

I asked ChatGPT to create a title for an adventure game and the first answer was already perfect: ""Elysium: The Battle for the Mystical Realm"". I then asked to create some background story and description of the game if it where a Multiplayer Adventure Game for PC. A lot of great stuff came out and I immediately was on fire for more!

I opened up Midjourney and started to create images with prompts for a First-Person Adventure Game in Unreal Engine 5. With the new version 5.0 it was extremely easy to pump out some very satisfying images. The only thing I had to fix in Photoshop was the Text - as Midjourney 5.0 is still not capable of writing text.

With very convincing fake descriptions and fake screenshots of a game that does not exist, i decided to go full nuts and set up a chat with ChatGPT to build me a HTML Bootstrap webpage for Elysium and again, it worked extremely well. Due to the limitation of \~ 500 characters per post, I had to split the website in building blocks like the Jumbotron or the Gallery one by one but with a little bit of Web Development Background it was nearly no effort - more or less simple copy & paste and adapting the links to images and so on.

Within \~3 hours, I was able to create the whole Fake Game including Web Page with a Countdown and hosted it on some webspace. I was extremely satisfied with the result so I decided to invest EUR 3,- in a cheap domain name and redirected it to the webspace to make it even more convincing.

So I posted some pictures to some friends and also the link to the web page. They are all eagerly awaiting the launch of Elysium on April 1st. I fully convinced them with content 100% created by AI!

***The Website is unfortunately only in German!***

The quality of computer-generated visuals, such as portraits, pet shots, videos, essays, and works of art, has grown on us. GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, Polycode, and more tools have taken the next logical step by augmenting the present code autocomplete capability with #AI.

As a result, #artificial intelligence (AI) and #machine learning (ML) have been gradually introduced into software development. Unlike cat pictures, however, research shows that there is a real risk connected with the origin, quality, and security of application code.

Copilot's autocompletion, for example, is trained on open-source code to provide relevant snippets. This makes the quality and security of suggestions contingent on the training set. The greater concern is with AI-generated software code, not with Copilot. Similar generators are likely to gain popularity in the coming years. The computer industry must consider how such code is created, how it is used, and who is held accountable when things go wrong.

Blockfence recently uncovered potential security risks involving OpenAI's ChatGPT. They found undisclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) from 2023 in the AI's responses. Intriguingly, when questioned, ChatGPT claimed to have ""invented"" the information about these undisclosed CVEs, which are currently marked as RESERVED.

The ""RESERVED"" status is key here because it means the vulnerabilities have been identified and a CVE number has been assigned, but the specifics are not yet public. Essentially, ChatGPT shared information that should not be publicly available yet, adding a layer of complexity to the issue of AI-generated content and data privacy.

This incident raises serious questions about AI's ethical boundaries and the need for transparency. OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, has previously acknowledged issues with ChatGPT, including a bug that allowed users to access others' chat histories. Also, Samsung had an embarrassing ChatGPT leak recently, so this is a big concern.

As we grapple with these emerging concerns, how can we push for greater AI transparency and improve data security? Let's discuss.

While the concerns raised by the signatories are valid, putting the brakes on AI development is not the most effective solution to the challenges we face.

First, it is essential to acknowledge the rapid advancements in AI, as exemplified by OpenAI's GPT-4. However, the development of powerful AI technologies has also resulted in substantial benefits across various industries, such as healthcare, transportation, and agriculture. By calling for a blanket pause on AI development, we risk stifling the progress that could lead to life-saving breakthroughs and more efficient systems.

Moreover, the pause fails to recognize that AI development is a global endeavor, and unilateral action by a group of concerned individuals is unlikely to have a significant impact on the pace of progress. Artificial intelligence research and development are being pursued by numerous organizations and countries worldwide, and a temporary halt in one area will only result in others pushing ahead.

Instead of attempting to halt AI development, we should advocate for a more collaborative approach to address the concerns raised by the signatories. By fostering an environment of cooperation and information-sharing among AI researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders, we can collectively develop best practices and ethical guidelines to mitigate potential risks.

One of the primary concerns highlighted in the open letter is the potential for AI systems like ChatGPT to be misused for spreading misinformation or generating ""grassroots"" letters to Congress. While these concerns are valid, the answer lies not in halting AI development, but in creating more robust detection and mitigation systems to counter malicious uses of the technology.

In addition, by working together with policymakers, researchers can help shape regulations that ensure AI is developed and deployed responsibly. This collaborative effort should focus on building AI systems that are accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal, as the open letter suggests.

In conclusion, a six-month pause on AI development might seem like a prudent step to address potential risks, but it ultimately stifles progress and innovation. Instead, we should strive for a more cooperative, proactive approach to tackle the challenges associated with AI development, ensuring that the benefits of this groundbreaking technology are realized while minimizing potential harm."

But I think there is going to be a great deal of confusion in the near future about AI ethics with language models being ""self aware"" and having ""feelings"", particularly for average people who have little understanding of how these complex models work.  I think the problems will stem from the internet itself.  As I sit here writing a thread about AI having simulated ""self Awareness"" at some point in the future, a language model or AI will probably read this.

And this is what I mean, language models read and train on a great deal of text from the internet.  The more people discuss machine learning/language models/AGI, the greater understanding AI will have of it.  If GPT4 has more up to date training, it's going to know a great deal about GPT3, and if open AI create ways for the model to continue learning from real world events it will learn a great deal about itself, including false information.

Point is, massive language models like GPT are going to get harder to control.  It's impossible to filter everything it reads, so it's going to take in a lot of information about itself and other AI systems that may or may not be true.  It could cause some very strange behavior when it starts connecting the dots.  Just my thoughts.

That is probably the worst case scenario for the near future. But this is not even, in the slightest, an unrealistic headline.

Current AI models are tailor made to be able to do this type of work. Couple that with viral viruses being one of human's greatest threats, and you get the perfect storm.

A capable enough model in the future will likely be able to design a virus that makes Covid look like a baby kitten. Or multiple such viruses all at once. That's if it can't even do this already, as of current generations.

Potentially the most dangerous thing of all, though, is that this ability may probably exist in unrestricted open source models within the next 4 years (likely sooner than that), models that any person on the planet could get their hands on and use.

This is not really even a question of whether this will be feasible. I don't see any sort of valid argument against this. There's a question over how deadly a virus (or multiple viruses all released at once) could actually be, but I can't imagine the answer being pretty, even if an 8th of the population is an overshot. AI models are already doing work very similar to such things in molecular biology. As said, this is pretty much their domain. Such things are child's play to these models.

The question will not be if it can be done but instead: will someone use it?

Will there actually be some guy or group out there with a hard-on for a mass population decline that also has the facilities to create such a virus? And if this becomes a real threat, then will governments allow this threat to exist in the open? And if not, then what measures will they take to prevent it from being there?

This is just one narrow example of the dangers AI could pose in the very near term. There will be countless others, but I foresee this one arising first as the initial major threat of the technology. And even if this one particular threat is skipped, there will inevitably be other extremely serious threats waiting right behind it.

Humanity is typically reactive over preventative. If you want my prediction: I believe we will live through some sort of mass tragedy before this technology is reacted to as is needed. After that it will hopefully be good and I feel optimistic. But I believe we will need to learn our lesson the hard way before we're able to get to that point. A worldwide 911 event so to speak, one that will shake to the core the way in which the world operates.

AI is pretty much like your 4yo son finding a live hand grenade and deciding to take it to school to play with in the playground. A very real tragedy is going to inevitably happen. We are that clueless child right now with a technology in our hands that we can barely fathom and a power we do not know. I don't know how this will not spark disaster at some point soon. I think most likely a true disaster needs to happen before we actually wake up and start taking things seriously enough.

It may even be better to get such a disaster over and out of the way whilst these models are still in their infancy and not at their full future potential. It's a hard thing to welcome though, given the scale of destruction that this could entail."

I don’t exactly want to drop $2k for a 4090, but it’s looking like 24GB of VRAM  is basically a necessity to run large-parameter LLMs. I’d especially love to hear from people with 12GB and 16GB GPUs, and how limited you do or don’t feel with those amounts of VRAM.

I also understand CPU performance isn’t as important as GPU compute, but would a current 8c/16t be powerful enough? I’m leaning towards a Ryzen build, but am open to any experience you’ve had with intel and amd CPUs, specific to AI.

What about RAM? Is 32GB enough?

Also, to anyone using cloud compute, what services are you using, and are you happy with it?

Lastly, any general resources like AI development focused YouTube channels, or recent online courses would also be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: Basically, I’m just interested in seeing what hardware you’re using for AI development, and how happy you are with it."
