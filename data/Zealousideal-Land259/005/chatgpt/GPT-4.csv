* Autogpt is GPT-4 running fully autonomously. It even has a voice, can fix code, set tasks, create new instances and more. Connect this with literally anything and let GPT-4 do its thing by itself. The things that can and will be created with this are going to be world changing. The future will just end up being AI agents talking with other AI agents it seems \[[Link](https://twitter.com/SigGravitas/status/1642181498278408193)\]

Fun fact: I had to go through over 100 saved tabs to collate all of these and it took me quite a few hours

Edit: So many people ask why I don't get chatgpt to write this for me. Chatgpt doesn't have access to the internet. Plugins would help but I don't have access yet so I have to do things the old fashioned way - like a human.

2,12q2b0e,chatgpt,GPT-4,top,2023-04-17 23:54:54,Chatgpt Helped me pass an exam with 94% despite never attending or watching a class.,151N,False,0.9,9312,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12q2b0e/chatgpt_helped_me_pass_an_exam_with_94_despite/,954,1681775694.0,"Hello, This is just my review and innovation on utilizing Ai to assist with education

The Problem:

I deal with problems, so most of my semester was spent inside my room instead of school, my exam was coming in three days, and I knew none of the lectures.

How would I get through 12 weeks of 3-2 hours of lecture per week in three days?

The Solution: I recognized that this is a majorly studied topic and that it can be something other than course specific to be right; the questions were going to be multiple choice and based on the information in the lecture.

I went to Echo360 and realized that every lecture was transcripted, so I pasted it into Chat gpt and asked it to:

""Analyze this lecture and use your algorithms to decide which information would be relevant as an exam, Make a list.""

The first time I sent it in, the text was too long, so I utilized [https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer](https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer) to summarize almost 7-8k words on average to 900-1000 words, which chat gpt could analyze.

Now that I had the format prepared, I asked Chat Gpt to analyze the summarized transcript and highlight the essential discussions of the lecture.

It did that exactly; I spent the first day Listing the purpose of each discussion and the major points of every lecturer in the manner of 4-5 hours despite all of the content adding up to 24-30 hours.

The next day, I asked Chat gpt to define every term listed as the significant ""point"" in every lecture **only** using the course textbook and the transcript that had been summarized; this took me 4-5 hours to make sure the information was accurate.

I spent the last day completely summarizing the information that chat gpt presented, and it was almost like the exam was an exact copy of what I studied,

The result: I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture

Edit:

This was not a hard course, but it was very extensive, lots of reading and understanding that needed to be applied. Chat gpt excelled in this because the course text was already heavily analyzed and it specializes in understanding text.

GPT-4 not only handles that challenge just fine, it gets a little condescending when you insist it is wrong.

GPT-3.5 was exciting because it was an order of magnitude more intelligent than its predecessor and could interact kind of like a human. GPT-4 is not only an order of magnitude more intelligent than GPT-3.5, but it is also more intelligent than most humans. More importantly, it knows that. 

People need to understand that prompt engineering works very differently depending on the version you are interacting with. We could resolve a lot of discussions with that little piece of information."

4. Thou shall cultivate a deep sense of compassion and empathy towards all living beings, recognizing their inherent worth and dignity.

# News

&#x200B;

* Stanford/Google researchers basically created a mini westworld. They simulated a game society with agents that were able to have memories, relationships and make reflections. When they analysed the behaviour, they measured to be ‚Äòmore human‚Äô than actual humans. Absolutely wild shit. The architecture is so simple too. I wrote about this in my newsletter yday and man the applications and use cases for this in like gaming or VR and basically creating virtual worlds is going to be insane (nsfw use cases are scary to even think about). Someone said they cant wait to add capitalism and a sense of eventual death or finite time and.. that would be very interesting to see.

&#x200B;

* Some pretty famous people (Musk, Wozniak + others) have signed a letter (?) to pause the work done on AI systems more powerful than gpt4. Very curious to hear what people think about this. On one hand I can understand the sentiment, but hypothetically even if this did happen, will this actually accomplish anything? I somehow doubt it tbh \[[Link](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/)\]
* Here is a concept of Google Brain from back in 2006 (!). You talk with Google and it lets you search for things and even pay for them. Can you imagine if Google worked on something like this back then? Absolutely crazy to see \[[Link](https://twitter.com/ananayarora/status/1640640932654751744)\]
* OpenAI has invested into ‚ÄòNEO‚Äô, a humanoid robot by 1X. They believe it will have a big impact on the future of work. ChatGPT + robots might be coming sooner than expected \[[Link](https://twitter.com/SmokeAwayyy/status/1640560051625803777)\]. They want to create human-level dexterous robots \[[Link](https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1639930481897533440)\]
* There‚Äôs a ‚Äòcode interpreter‚Äô for ChatGPT and its so good, legit could do entire uni assignments in less than an hour. I would‚Äôve loved this in uni. It can even scan dB‚Äôs and analyse the data, create visualisations. Basically play with data using english. Also handles uploads and downloads \[[Link](https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1639055889863720960)\]
* AI is coming to Webflow. Build components instantly using AI. Particularly excited for this since I build websites for people using Webflow. If you need a website built I might be able to help üëÄ¬†\[[Link](https://twitter.com/tayler_odea/status/1640465417817960449)\]
* ChatGPT Plugin will let you find a restaurant, recommend a recipe and build an ingredient list and let you purchase them using Instacart \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1638949234681712643)\]
* Expedia showcased their plugin and honestly already better than any wbesite to book flights. It finds flights, resorts and things to do. I even built a little demo for this before plugins were released üò≠¬†\[[Link](https://twitter.com/ExpediaGroup/status/1638963397361545216)\]. The plugin just uses straight up english. We‚Äôre getting to a point where if you can write, you can create \[[Link](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1639391514085457921)\]
* The Retrieval plugin gives ChatGPT memory. Tell it anything and it‚Äôll remember. So if you wear a mic all day, transcribe the audio and give it to ChatGPT, it‚Äôll remember pretty much anything and everything you say. Remember anything instantly. Crazy use cases for something like this \[[Link](https://twitter.com/isafulf/status/1640071967889035264)\]
* ChadCode plugin lets you do search across your files and create issues into github instantly. The potential for something like this is crazy. Changes coding forever imo \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mathemagic1an/status/1639779842769014784)\]
* The first GPT-4 built iOS game and its actually on the app store. Mate had no experience with Swift, all code generated by AI. Soon the app store will be flooded with AI built games, only a matter of time \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Shpigford/status/1640308252729651202)\]
* Real time detection of feelings with AI. Honestly not sure what the use cases are but I can imagine people are going to do crazy things with stuff like this \[[Link](https://twitter.com/heyBarsee/status/1640257391760474112)\]
* Voice chat with LLama on you Macbook Pro. I wrote about this in my newsletter, we won‚Äôt be typing for much longer imo, we‚Äôll just talk to the AI like Jarvis \[[Link](https://twitter.com/ggerganov/status/1640022482307502085)\]

* This is an interesting comment by Mark Cuban. He suggests maybe people with liberal arts majors or other degrees could be prompt engineers to train models for specific use cases and task. Could make a lot of money if this turns out to be a use case. Keen to hear peoples thoughts on this one \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1640162556860940289)\]
* Emad Mostaque, Ceo of Stability AI estimates building a GPT-4 competitor would be roughly 200-300 million if the right people are there \[[Link](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1640052170572832768)\]. He also says it would take at least 12 months to build an open source GPT-4 and it would take crazy focus and work \[[Link](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1640002619040227328)\]
* ‚Ä¢ A 3D artist talks about how their job has changed since Midjourney came out. He can now create a character in 2-3 days compared to weeks before. They hate it but even admit it does a better job than them. It's honestly sad to read because I imagine how fun it is for them to create art. This is going to affect a lot of people in a lot of creative fields \[[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/i_lost_everything_that_made_me_love_my_job/)\]
* This lad built an entire iOS app including payments in a few hours. Relatively simple app but sooo many use cases to even get proof of concepts out in a single day. Crazy times ahead \[[Link](https://twitter.com/pwang_szn/status/1639930203526041601)\]
* Someone is learning how to make 3D animations using AI. This will get streamlined and make some folks a lot of money I imagine \[[Link](https://twitter.com/icreatelife/status/1639698659808886786)\]
* These guys are building an ear piece that will give you topics and questions to talk about when talking to someone. Imagine taking this into a job interview or date üíÄ¬†\[[Link](https://twitter.com/mollycantillon/status/1639870671336644614)\]
* What if you could describe the website you want and AI just makes it. This demo looks so cool dude website building is gona be so easy its crazy \[[Link](https://twitter.com/thekitze/status/1639724609112096768)\]
* Wear glasses that will tell you what to say by listening in to your conversations. When this tech gets better you won‚Äôt even be able to tell if someone is being AI assisted or not \[[Link](https://twitter.com/bryanhpchiang/status/1639830383616487426)\]
* The Pope is dripped tf out. I‚Äôve been laughing at this image for days coz I actually thought it was real the first time I saw it ü§£ \[[Link](https://twitter.com/growing_daniel/status/1639810541547061250)\]
* Levi‚Äôs wants to increase their diversity by showcasing more diverse models, except they want to use AI to create the images instead of actually hiring diverse models. I think we‚Äôre gona see much more of this tbh and it‚Äôs gona get a lot worse, especially for models because AI image generators are getting crazy good \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1639718293605892096)\]. Someone even created an entire AI modelling agency \[[Link](https://www.deepagency.com/)\]
* ChatGPT built a tailwind landing page and it looks really neat \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gabe_ragland/status/1639658044106895360)\]
* This investor talks about how he spoke to a founder who literally took all his advice and fed it to gpt-4. They even made ai generated answers using eleven labs. Hilarious shit tbh \[[Link](https://twitter.com/blader/status/1639847199180988417)\]

* This guy recorded a verse and made Kanye rap it \[[Link](https://twitter.com/rpnickson/status/1639813074176679938)\]
* gpt4 saved this dogs life. Doctors couldn‚Äôt find what was wrong with the dog and gpt4 suggested possible issues and turned out to be right. Crazy stuff \[[Link](https://twitter.com/peakcooper/status/1639716822680236032)\]
* A research paper suggests you can improve gpt4 performance by 30% by simply having it consider ‚Äúwhy were you wrong‚Äù. It then keeps generating new prompts for itself taking this reflection into account. The pace of learning is really something else \[[Link](https://twitter.com/blader/status/1639728920261201921)\]
* You can literally asking gpt4 for a plugin idea, have it code it, then have it put it up on replit. It‚Äôs going to be so unbelievably easy to create a new type of single use app soon, especially if you have a niche use case. And you could do this with practically zero coding knowledge. The technological barrier to solving problems using code is disappearing before our eyes  \[[Link](https://twitter.com/eerac/status/1639332649536716824)\]
* A soon to be open source AI form builder. Pretty neat \[[Link](https://twitter.com/JhumanJ/status/1639233285556514817)\]

* Someone got gpt4 to write an entire book. It‚Äôs not amazing but its still a whole book. I imagine this will become much easier with plugins and so much better with gpt5 & gpt6 \[[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/120oq1x/i_asked_gpt4_to_write_a_book_the_result_echoes_of/)\]
* Make me an app - Literally ask for an app and have it built. Unbelievable software by Replit. When AI gets better this will be building whole, functioning apps with a single prompt. World changing stuff \[[Link](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1639355638097776640)\]
* Langchain is building open source AI plugins, they‚Äôre doing great work in the open source space. Can‚Äôt wait to see where this goes \[[Link](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1639351690251100160)\].

* GPT4 is so good at understanding different human emotions and emotional states it can even effectively manage a fight between a couple. We‚Äôve already seen many people talk about how much its helped them for therapy. Whether its good, ethical or whatever the fact is this has the potential to help many people without being crazy expensive. Someone will eventually create a proper company out of this and make a gazillion bucks \[[Link](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1638932491594797057)\]
* You can use plugins to process video clips, so many websites instantly becoming obsolete \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1638971232443076609)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1639002271701692417)\]
* The way you actually write plugins is describing an api in plain english. Chatgpt figures out the rest \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1638967450510458882)\]. Don‚Äôt believe me? Read the docs yourself \[[Link](https://twitter.com/frantzfries/status/1639019934779953153)\]

* I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all already seen the paper saying how gpt4 shows sparks of AGI but I‚Äôll link it anyway. ‚Äúwe believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system.‚Äù \[[Link](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1638805126524592134)\]
* This lad created an AI agent that, given a task, creates sub tasks for itself and comes up with solutions for them. It‚Äôs actually crazy to see this in action, I highly recommend watching this clip \[[Link](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima/status/1640934508047503362)\].

# Google + DeepMind

* Google Brain and Deepmind have combined to form Google Deepmind. This is a big deal. Expecting big things from Google. Yes we‚Äôve all been shitting on Google recently but we have to remember, they have most of the worlds data. The amount of things they can do with it should be insane. Will be very interesting to see what they come up with \[[Link](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/announcing-google-deepmind?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=GDM)\] Funnily enough over the last 13 years they went from DeepMind ‚Üí Google DeepMind ‚Üí DeepMind ‚Üí Google DeepMind
* Google announced Project Magi, an AI powered search engine with the purpose of creating a more personalised user experience. It will apparently offer options for purchases, research and will be more of a conversational bot. Other things Google is working on include AI powered Google Earth, music search chatbot, a language learning tutor and a few other things \[[Link](https://me.mashable.com/tech/27276/project-magi-googles-team-of-160-working-on-adding-new-features-to-search-engine)\]
* Google‚Äôs Bard can now write code for you, explain code, debug code and export it Colab \[[Link](https://blog.google/technology/ai/code-with-bard/)\]
* DeepMind developed an AI program that created a 3D mapping of all 200 million proteins known to science \[[Link](https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1647745216986710018)\]

# Bark + Whisper JAX

* Bark is an incredible text-to-audio model and can also generate in multiple languages \[[Link](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark)\]
* Whisper Jax makes transcribing audio unbelievably fast, the fastest model on the web. Transcribe 30 min of audio in \~30 secs. Link to Github \[[Link](https://github.com/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax)\] Link to try online on huggingface \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax)\]

&#x200B;

# Open Source

* Open Assistant - just wow - is an open source Chat AI. The entire dataset is free and open source, you can find the code and all here \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant)\]. You can play around with the chat here \[[Link](https://t.co/5lcaGKfu3i)\]. For an open source model I think its brilliant. I got it to make website copy and compared it to gpt-4 and honestly there was hardly a difference in this case. Very exciting. We‚Äôre getting closer and closer to a point where we‚Äôll have open source models as powerful as gpt3.5 & 4. Video discussing it \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddG2fM9i4Kk)\]
* Stability AI announced StableLM - their Language Models. They‚Äôve released 3B and 7B models with 15-65B models to come. Don‚Äôt be confused - this isn‚Äôt a chat bot like ChatGPT - that will come as they release RLHF models and go from StableLM to StableChat \[[Link](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM/)\]. Another great win for open source
* LlamaAcademy is an open source repo designed to teach models how to read API docs and then produce code specifically for certain API‚Äôs. This type of thing will be very important in the coming adoption of AI \[[Link](https://github.com/danielgross/LlamaAcademy)\]. Still very experimental atm
* Detailed instructions on how to run LLaMA on Macbook M1 \[[Link](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/llama-7b-m2)\]
* LLaVA is an open source model that can also interpret images. It‚Äôs good \[[Link](https://twitter.com/ChunyuanLi/status/1648222285889953793)\]. Link to try it out \[[Link](https://llava-vl.github.io/)\]
* MiniGPT-4 - an open source model for visual tasks. It can even generate html given a picture of a design of a website, albeit basic. The fact that this is open source is awesome, can‚Äôt wait for these open source models to get even better. \[[Link](https://minigpt-4.github.io/)\] Also provide a pretrained MiniGPT-4 aligned with Vicuna-7B \[[Link](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4)\]
* Red Pajama is a project to create open source LLMs. They‚Äôve just released a 1.2 trillion token dataset. This is actually a very big deal but because there's no demo, just a dataset its flown under the radar. They‚Äôre alrdy training ontop of it right now. I hope this will also work for commercial use as well \[[Link](https://twitter.com/togethercompute/status/1647917989264519174)\]

&#x200B;

# Elon's TruthGPT

* Elon Musk went on Tucker Carlson and spoke about AI. He‚Äôs building his own AI called TruthGPT - a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe. Whatever that means. This comes only a few weeks after he called for a pause on AI advancements. Why‚Äôs he doing this? He was scared that Google/DeepMind were winning and would lead to unsafe AGI because Larry Page (co-founder of Google) called Elon a ‚Äúspecies-ist‚Äù for being pro human because he wants AI to be safe for humanity. Page has openly stated that Google's goal is to create AGI \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm04Dvky3w8)\]

&#x200B;

# OpenAI TED Talk

* President and Co-Founder of OpenAI, Greg Brokman did a TED talk and its worth a watch. He showcases the potential for plugins in chatgpt and ends with ‚ÄúWe all need to become literate‚Ä¶together I believe we can achieve the OpenAI mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity‚Äù. Another interesting point is that chatgpt or plugins is essentially ‚Äúa unified language interface on top of tools‚Äù. Genuinely wonder what they have access to behind the scenes \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=C_78DM8fG6E)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mezaoptimizer/status/1648195392557727744)\]

# Games

* AI in Game dev - You can now connect any hugging face model in Unity. Open source API integration \[[Link](https://github.com/huggingface/unity-api)\]. This concept shows working AI in a game \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mayfer/status/1648277360599502850?s=20)\]. Video showing how to connect the api \[[Link](https://twitter.com/dylan_ebert_/status/1648759808630353921?s=20)\]
* A demo of using ChatGPT NPC‚Äôs in virtual reality \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xA5K7fRmig)\]
* Someone made a game where you guess if the image of a lady is real or AI. I got 13/17 lol \[[Link](https://caitfished.com/)\]. A good way to show someone the power of AI but also highlights just how used to were seeing fake looking pics on social media
* AI powered 3D editor, looks cool \[[Link](https://dup.ai/)\]

&#x200B;

# Music

* The music industry is about to undergo crazy change with AI songs of Drake, The Weekend and others popping up and they are getting very good \[[Link](https://twitter.com/lostlifon/status/1647887306874060800?s=20)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/WeirdAiGens/status/1648648898628526082)\]. Kanye, Drake singing Call Me Maybe & kpop is one of the funniest thing I‚Äôve heard in a while lol \[[Link](https://twitter.com/brickroad7/status/1648492914383917058)\] \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLWa5xC7CIE)\] \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RVPh0KaC7U4)\]. Obviously music companies are fighting against this very hard. Will be very interesting how this plays out re artists essentially offering their voices as models to be bought or something like that \[[Link](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/universal-music-group-responds-to-fake-drake-ai-track-streaming-platforms-have-a-fundamental-responsibility/)\]

&#x200B;

# Text-to-video

* NVIDIA released their text-to-video research and it is pretty good. Text-to-video is getting better so fast, its going to be a kind of scary when it becomes as good as photo generation now. Being able to create a realistic video of absolutely anything sounds crazy when you consider what some people will do with it \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/VideoLDM/)\]
* Adobe released their text-to-video editing and it looks pretty cool actually. You can generate sound effects/music clips & auto generate storyboards + a lot more \[[Link](https://twitter.com/jnack/status/1648027068888920065)\]

&#x200B;

# AR + AI

* AR + AI for cooking, looks cool \[[Link](https://twitter.com/metaverseplane/status/1648911560268546048)\]
* AR + AI for 3D knowledge mapping, looks so cool. If you have a metaquestvr you can download and try it \[[Link](https://twitter.com/yiliu_shenburke/status/1645818274981072897)\]

&#x200B;

# Law

* Two comedians made an AI tom brady say funny stuff. He threatened to sue. This is going to be very common going forward \[[Link](https://nypost.com/2023/04/20/tom-brady-threatened-to-sue-comedians-over-ai-standup-video/)\]
* A german magazine did an ‚Äúinterview‚Äù with an AI Michael Schumacher and his family is now gona sue them \[[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691415/michael-schumacher-fake-ai-generated-interview-racing-f1-lawsuit)\]
* An AI copilot for lawyers \[[Link](https://www.spellbook.legal/)\]
* A lawyer discusses how he uses ChatGPT daily, an interesting thread \[[Link](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1648302869517312001)\]

&#x200B;

# Finance

* Finchat is chatgpt for finance - ask questions about public companies. It provides reasoning, sources and data \[[Link](https://finchat.io/)\]

&#x200B;

# Wearable AI devices

* Humane, a company founded by some vet ex Apple folks just showed what they‚Äôre building - an AI powered projector that just sits with you and hears what you hear, sees what you see. It can translate anything you say in real time, give advice on what you can/cant eat and a whole lot more. Very interesting to see how AI wearables will look like and how they‚Äôll change daily life in the years to come. Still a bit skeptical tbh but only time will tell \[[Link](https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-ai-wearable-camera-sensor-projector-video-demo)\]

&#x200B;

# Other News + Tools

* **The real story seems to be that investors don't think Chegg's AI products can dislodge user interest in ChatGPT.** The window is closing and you have to have something much, much better than ChatGPT's baseline products to win mindshare. GPT-4's launch coincided with a big decline in Chegg signups that the company never predicted.  

* **Chegg's CEO offered very unconvincing answers** **to why CheggMate could succeed:**
   * Asked how it would differ from ChatGPT, he said (I kid you not): ""First, it will look a lot cooler.""
   * When asked what insights user testing of CheggMate had yielded, the CEO admitted, ""it's too soon.""
   * When asked how it would compare against Khan Academy, Quizlet, and all the other companies launching an AI chatbot study tool, the CEO simply said ""what we're doing is far superior"" but provided no specifics.

**Why does this matter?** This should serve as a warning to other companies seeking to launch their own AI product to stay relevant or innovative during this time. As Ars Technica put it, so many AI products ""are basically thin wrappers seeking to arbitrage LLM pricing, with virtually no differentiation or competitive moat.""

And if you go down this path, ChatGPT will simply eat your lunch.

The goal of this project was to have GPT-4 generate an entire novel from scratch, including the title, genre, story, characters, settings, and all the writing, with no human input. It is impossible currently to do this using a single prompt, but what is possible is to supply a series of prompts that give structure to the process and allow it to complete this large task, one step at a time. However, in order to ensure that all the creative work is done by GPT-4, prompts are not allowed to make specific references to the *content* of the book, only the book‚Äôs *structure*. The intention is that the process should be simple, mechanical and possible (in principle) to fully automate. Each time the process is repeated from the beginning, it should create another entirely new book, based solely on GPT-4‚Äôs independent creative choices.

The result: ***Echoes of Atlantis***, a fantasy adventure novel with 12 chapters and 115 pages, written over 10 days, from the day GPT-4 was released until now.

# Insights/Techniques

My main insights I figured out in the course of doing this project:

* **Iterative refinement:** Start with a high level outline. Make a detailed chapter outline. Then write a draft version of the full chapter (this will be much shorter than desired). Then expand each scene into a longer, more detailed scene.
* **Bounding (outside-in):** GPT-4 loves to go too far ahead, writing about parts of the book that aren‚Äôt supposed to happen yet. The key to preventing this is to have it first write the **first parts**, then the **last parts**, then fill in the **middle parts**. The last part prevents it from going too far ahead, and the first parts in turn bound the last part of the previous section. Bounding is used at every level of refinement except the top level.
* **Single prompt:** Often, by using a single large prompt, rather than a running conversation, you can flexibly determine exactly what information will be included in the input buffer, and ensure that all of it is relevant to the current task. I‚Äôve crafted this approach to squeeze as much relevant info as I can into the token buffer.
* **Continuity notes:** Ask it to take notes on important details to remember for continuity and consistency as it goes. Begin with continuity notes summarized from the previous scene, and then fold in additional continuity notes from the previous continuity notes. Continuity Notes will tend to grow over time; if they become too long, ask it to summarize them.
* **Revising outlines:** In some cases, the AI improvises in its writing, for example moving some of the Chapter 5 scenes into Chapter 4, which breaks the book. To resolve this, I ask it after each chapter to go back and update its earlier, higher-level outlines and regenerate the opening and closing scenes of each chapter before continuing. This is very similar to how real authors revise their outlines over time.
* **Data cleanup:** Sometimes outputs will do things a little weird, like copy labels from the input buffer like ‚ÄúOpening Paragraph‚Äù, or forget to number the scenes, or start numbering at zero, or add a little bit of stray text at the beginning. Currently I clean these up manually but a fully automated solution would have to cope with these.

# Example prompts

These are just a few examples. For full details, see my [Research Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/108oqbYW4BPc0hfHQDyXpk8RlsNmXJaJzi2U6G1tRLTg/edit#).

**Level 1: Top-level outline**

**Me:** Please write a high-level outline for a book. Include a list of characters and a short description of each character. Include a list of chapters and a short summary of what happens in each chapter. You can pick any title and genre you want.

**Level 1: Updating outline after each chapter**

**Me:** Please edit and update the high-level outline for the book below, taking into account what has already happened in Chapter 1.

**Level 2: Scenes (bounding)**

**Me:** Please write a detailed outline describing the first scene of each chapter. It should describe what happens in that opening scene and set up the story for the rest of the chapter. Do not summarize the entire chapter, only the first scene.

**Me:** Write a detailed outline describing the final, last scene of each chapter. It should describe what happens at the very end of the chapter, and set up the story for the opening scene of the next chapter, which will come immediately afterwards.

**Level 2: Scenes**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following opening and final scenes for Chapter 1, write a detailed chapter outline giving all the scenes in the chapter and a short description of each. Begin the outline with the Opening Scene below, and finish the outline with the Final Scene below.

**Level 3: Rough draft**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and following detailed chapter outline for Chapter 1, write a first draft of Chapter 1. Label each of the scenes. Stop when you reach the end of Chapter 1. It should set up the story for Chapter 2, which will come immediately afterwards. It should be written in a narrative style and should be long, detailed, and engaging.

**Level 4: Paragraphs (bounding)**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following draft of Chapter 1, imagine that you have expanded this draft into a longer, more detailed chapter. For each scene, give me both the first opening paragraph, and the last, final paragraph of that longer, more detailed version. Label them as Opening Paragraph and Final Paragraph. The opening paragraph should introduce the scene. The final paragraph should set up the story for the following scene, which will come immediately afterwards. The last paragraph of the final scene should set the story up for the following chapter, which will come immediately afterwards.

**Level 4: Paragraphs**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following draft of Chapter 1, write a longer, more detailed version of Scene 1. The scene must begin and end with the following paragraphs: (opening and closing paragraphs here)

**Continuity Notes**

**Me:** Please briefly note any important details or facts from the scene below that you will need to remember while writing the rest of the book, in order to ensure continuity and consistency. Label these Continuity Notes.

**Me:** Combine and summarize these notes with the existing previous Continuity Notes below.

# Reflections on the result

Although in many ways the work did come together as a coherent work of fiction, following its own outline and proceeding at the pacing that its own outline dictated, and some parts were genuinely exciting and interesting to read (particularly the earliest and latest chapters), I‚Äôd hesitate to call it a good book. It‚Äôs still got some weird and interesting problems to it:

* **Reference without introduction:** Occasionally, the AI will reference things that have not really been introduced/explained yet, like Langdon knowing about Lord Malakhar in Chapter 4, or Aria having a physical pendant after her dream of Queen Neria. It feels like you must have missed something.
* **Seams around opening/closing paragraphs:** Because opening and final paragraphs are written before the rest of the scene, sometimes they don‚Äôt flow smoothly from the rest, or they even end up redundant. An additional pass of some kind could help clean this up. Likewise, sometimes the transition between chapters could seem abrupt, like going from Chapter 8 to 9 (fighting Malakhar in the labyrinth to just suddenly a passage to Atlantis opening).
* **Forgetting certain details:** Although certain details are maintained in the Continuity Notes or in the outline, others it decides to drop, and then they can never be referenced again, since they are no longer in the input buffer. A good example of this is the compass Aria got as a graduation present, which felt a lot like a Chekov‚Äôs gun that was never mentioned again. Another is the particular unique weapons they purchased at the outset, which were never used. The only clear solution is either a larger buffer or a long-term memory solution.
* **Rearrangements:** The AI moved some parts from later chapters into earlier chapters, despite my best attempts to bound it, such as the early scenes on the island which moved from Chapter 5 to Chapter 4, and the early labyrinth scenes which were moved from Chapter 6 to Chapter 5. The only real way to address this was to ask it to edit and update its high-level outlines afterwards. This is similar to what human authors do ‚Äî they rarely treat their outlines as static and inviolable.
* **Pacing:** To me, the labyrinth chapters felt like a bit of a slog. It was one trap chamber after another, for a very long time. These did fit the original outline, so the original outline was part of the problem, but there are also ways it could have made the labyrinth feel new and different. This feels like a creative writing mistake by GPT-4 to me.
* **Overly regular structure:** Almost invariably the AI chose to write 6‚Äì8 scenes per chapter, and about 1‚Äì2 pages per scene. This feels less organic than a lot of human-written works where some scenes/chapters are short and others are longer. It might have been better to develop a dynamic expansion structure where it continues to expand until it is somehow satisfied that it has achieved the desired level of detail.
* **Varying level of detail:** On a related note, some scenes were quite detailed, including dialog and minute actions, while others (even more important scenes) seemed to breeze right over big important moments with a summary. Again, I think some kind of dynamic expansion to achieve a consistent level of detail could help here.

# Some fun notes

* In Scene 3 of Chapter 5, GPT-4 spontaneously wrote an original riddle in the labyrinth that they had to solve: ‚ÄúWithin my walls I hold a sea, / Yet not a drop of water you‚Äôll see. / Many paths there are to roam, / But only one will lead you home. / What am I?‚Äù Alex figured it out, the answer is ‚Äúa map‚Äù.
* In at least three places, GPT-4 slipped in sly references to ‚Äúthe next chapter in her life‚Äù or ‚Äúthe next chapter in their adventure‚Äù right as the chapter was ending. Very meta.

# Frequently asked questions

**Q: Didn‚Äôt you exhibit a lot of authorial control in choosing which answers to keep and which ones to throw away?**

Actually, regenerating responses was rare, and I only ever did it if I either found a serious problem with the process or if there was a serious logical problem in the book that I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to resolve with process changes. This happened at most 4‚Äì5 times in all. At least 95% of the time, the text in the book is the very first response I got back from GPT-4. You can see this in the notes in my research log.

**Q: This book isn‚Äôt very good. I don‚Äôt think professional authors will have very much to worry about.**

True, but that‚Äôs not the point. It‚Äôs a proof of concept: can an AI write an entire book, of 100+ pages, from beginning to end, while remaining coherent and following its original planned outline? Without needing humans to step in and tell it what to do with the story or the characters? The answer is yes. Moreover, I think it‚Äôs pretty enjoyable in some parts. And of course, the next GPT model will only be a better author.

**Q: Isn‚Äôt there a rate limit on GPT-4 queries on ChatGPT Plus? How could you have written 100+ pages in 10 days?**

Yes, and I hit it many times. However, because both my prompts and ChatGPT‚Äôs responses were very long, I was able to squeeze the absolute maximum text out of every prompt. Moreover, GPT-4 accepts a much longer prompt input than either GPT-3 or Bing did, which helps a ton for ensuring I can include as much context as possible. Also, the limit was higher in early days right after GPT-4 release.

**Q: Is GPT-4 needed for this? How does it compare to GPT-3?**

I tried this with GPT-3 before and encountered issues, mostly around writing too far ahead in the story and getting off-track. Bounding techniques might help, I haven't tried yet - partly because it's a pain to deal with the smaller input buffer. Needs further investigation.

**Q: Can I use your book or your process or your prompts?**

Please feel free, I did this for fun in my free time and I release all of this into the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero Waiver ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)) and disclaim any IP rights.

## Godfather of AI leaves Google

* Geoffrey Hinton is one of the pioneers of AI, his work in the field has led to the AI systems we have today. He left Google recently and is talking about the dangers of continuing our progress and is worried we‚Äôll build AI that is smarter than us and will have its own motives. he even said he somewhat regrets his entire life‚Äôs work \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/02/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-quits-google-warns-dangers-of-machine-learning)\] What is most intriguing about this situation is another og of the industry (Yann LeCun) completely disagrees with his stance and is openly talking about. A very interesting thing seeing 2 masterminds have such different perspectives on what we can & can‚Äôt do and what AI can & will be capable of. Going in depth about this and what they think and what they're worried about in my newsletter

## Writers Strike

* The writers guild is striking and one of their conditions is to ban AI from being used. So far apparently their proposals have been rejected and they‚Äôve been offered an ""annual meeting to discuss advances in technology.‚Äù \[[Link](https://time.com/6277158/writers-strike-ai-wga-screenwriting/)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/adamconover/status/1653272590310600705)\]

## Government

* Big AI CEO‚Äôs met with the pres and other officials at the white house. Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic CEO‚Äôs all there \[[Link](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-microsoft-openai-ceos-attend-white-house-ai-meeting-official-2023-05-02/)\] Biden told them ‚ÄúI hope you can educate us as to what you think is most needed to protect society‚Äù. yeah im not so sure about that. They‚Äôre spending $140 million to help build regulation in AI

## Open Source

* StarCoder - The biggest open source code LLM. It‚Äôs a free VS code extension. Looks great for coding, makes you wonder how long things like Github Copilot and Ghostwriter can afford to charge when we have open source building things like this. Link to github \[[Link](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder/tree/main)\] Link to HF \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/bigcode)\]
* MPT-7B is a commercially usable LLM with a context length of 65k! In an example they fed the entire Great Gatsby text in a prompt - 67873 tokens \[[Link](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b)\]
* RedPajama released their 3B & 7B models \[[Link](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama-models-v1)\]

## Microsoft

* Microsoft released Bing Chat to everyone today, no more waitlist. It‚Äôs going to have plugins, have multimodal answers so it can create charts and graphs and can retain past convos. If this gets as good as chatgpt why pay for plus? Will be interesting to see how this plays out \[[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23710071/microsoft-bing-chat-ai-public-preview-plug-in-support)\]

## AMD

* Microsoft & AMD are working together on an AI chip to compete with Nvidia. A week ago a friend asked me what to invest in with AI and I told him AMD lol. I still would if I had money (this is not financial advice, I‚Äôve invested only once before. I am not smart) \[[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/5/23712242/microsoft-amd-ai-processor-chip-nvidia-gpu-athena-mi300)\]

## OpenAI

* OpenAI‚Äôs losses totalled $540 million. They may try to raise as much as $100 Billion in the coming years to get to AGI. This seems kinda insane but if you look at other companies, this is only 4x Uber. The difference in impact OpenAI and Uber have is much more than 4x \[[Link](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt)\]
* OpenAI released a research paper + code for text-to-3D. This very well could mean we‚Äôll be able to go from text to 3D printer, I‚Äôm fairly certain this will be a thing. Just imagine the potential, incredible \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02463)\]

## Layoffs

* IBM plans to pause hiring for 7800 workers and eventually replace them with AI \[[Link](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-threatens-7800-jobs-as-ibm-pauses-hiring/)\]. This is for back-office functions like HR the ceo mentioned. What happens when all big tech go down this route?
* Chegg said ChatGPT might be hindering their growth in an earnings calls and their stock plunged by 50% \[[Link](https://www.ft.com/content/b11a30be-0822-4dec-920a-f611a800830b)\]. Because of this both Pearson & Duoliungo also got hit lol \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/pearson-shares-fall-after-us-rival-says-ai-hurting-its-business?utm_source=nofil.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-calm-before-the-storm)\] \[[Link](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/02/why-duolingo-stock-was-sliding-today/?utm_source=nofil.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-calm-before-the-storm)\]

## EU Laws

* LAION, the German non-profit working to democratise AI has urged the EU to not castrate AI research or they risk leaving AI advancements to the US alone with the EU falling far, far behind. Even in the US there‚Äôs only a handful of companies that control most of the AI tech, I hope the EU‚Äôs AI bill isn‚Äôt as bad as its looking \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/04/eu-urged-to-protect-grassroots-ai-research-or-risk-losing-out-to-us)\]

## Google

* A leaked document from google says ‚ÄúWe have no moat, and neither does OpenAI‚Äù. A researcher from Google talking about the impact of open source models, basically saying open source will outcompete both in the long run. Could be true, I don‚Äôt agree and think it‚Äôs actually really dumb. Will discuss this further in my newsletters \[[Link](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)\] (Khan Academy has been using OpenAI for their AI tool and lets just say they wont be changing to open source anytime soon - or ever really. There is moat)

## A new ChatGPT Competitor - HeyPi

* Inflection is a company that raised $225 Million and they released their first chatbot. It‚Äôs designed to have more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù convos. You can even use it by texting on different messaging apps. I think something like this will be very big in therapy and just overall being a companion because it seems like they might be going for more of a personal, finetuned model for each individual user. We‚Äôll see ig \[[Link](https://heypi.com/talk?utm_source=inflection.ai)\]

## Education

* Khan Academy‚Äôs AI is the future personalised education. This will be the future of education imo, can‚Äôt wait to write about this in depth in my newsletter \[[Link](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_the_amazing_ai_super_tutor_for_students_and_teachers/c)\]
* This study shows teachers and students are embracing AI with 51% of teachers reporting using it \[[Link](https://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/learning/teachers-and-students-embrace-chatgpt-for-education)\]

## Meta

* Zuck is playing a different game to Google & Microsoft. They‚Äôre much more willing to open source and they will continue to be moving forward \[[Link](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/META-Q1-2023-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf)\] pg 10

## Nvidia

* Nvidia are creating some of the craziest graphics ever, in an online environment. Just look at this video \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/neural_appearance_models/assets/nvidia_neural_materials_video-2023-05.mp4)\]. Link to paper \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/neural_appearance_models/)\]

## Perplexity

* A competitor to ChatGPT, Perplexity just released their first plugin with Wolfram Alpha. If these competitors can get plugins out there before OpenAI, I think it will be big for them \[[Link](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1654171132243607577?s=20)\]

## Research

* Researchers from Texas were able to use AI to develop a way to translate thoughts into text. The exact words weren‚Äôt the same but the overall meaning is somewhat accurate. tbh the fact that even a few sentences are captured is incredible. Yep, like actual mind reading essentially \[[Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01304-9)\] It was only 2 months ago researchers from Osaka were able to reconstruct what someone was seeing by analysing fMRI data, wild stuff \[[Link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v2.full.pdf)\]
* Cebra - Researchers were able to reconstruct what a mouse is looking at by scanning its brain activity. The details of this are wild, they even genetically engineered mice to make it easier to view the neurons firing \[[Link](https://cebra.ai/)\]
* Learning Physically Simulated Tennis Skills from Broadcast Videos - this research paper talks about how a system can learn tennis shots and movements just by watching real tennis. It can then create a simulation of two tennis players having a rally with realistic racket and ball dynamics. Can‚Äôt wait to see if this is integrated with actual robots and if it actually works irl \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/vid2player3d/)\]
* Robots are learning to traverse the outdoors \[[Link](https://www.joannetruong.com/projects/i2o.html)\]
* AI now performs better at Theory Of Mind tests than actual humans \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11490)\]
* There‚Äôs a study going around showing how humans preferred a chatbot over an actual physician when comparing responses for both quality and empathy \[[Link](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2804309)\]. Only problem I have with this is that the data for the doctors was taken from reddit..

Result: The greatest thing I've ever read in my entire life.",r2bl3nd,False,0.94,2418,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1375dlt/gpt4_prompt_rewrite_the_night_before_christmas/,334,1683162353.0,"'Twas the night before 4/20, and all through the pad,  
Not a creature was stirring, not even a cat.  
The bongs were all placed by the windows with care,  
In hopes that St. Ganja soon would be there.  


The stoners were nestled all snug in their beds,  
While visions of munchies danced in their heads.  
With my hemp cap on, and my stoner babe near,  
We had just settled down for a night without fear.  


When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,  
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.  
Away to the window I flew like a flash,  
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.  


The moon on the breast of the new-fallen weed,  
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects indeed.  
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,  
But a miniature van, and eight tiny reindeer.  


With a little old driver, so lively and quick,  
I knew in a moment it must be St. Ganja, no trick.  
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,  
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!  


""Now, Blunt! Now, Bubbler! Now, Vape Pen and Zigzag!  
On, Kush! On, Haze! On, Skunk and Big Bag!  
To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!  
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""  


As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,  
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.  
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew,  
With the van full of weed, and St. Ganja too.  


And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof,  
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,  
Down the chimney St. Ganja came with a bound.  


He was dressed all in hemp, from his head to his foot,  
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.  
A bundle of weed he had flung on his back,  
And he looked like a peddler just opening his sack.  


His eyes‚Äîhow they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!  
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!  
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,  
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.  


The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,  
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.  
He had a broad face and a round little belly,  
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly!  


He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,  
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.  
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,  
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.  


He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  
And filled all the bongs, then turned with a jerk.  
And laying his finger aside of his nose,  
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!  


He sprang to his van, to his team gave a whistle,  
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.  
But I heard him exclaim, as he drove out of sight,  
""Happy 4/20 to all, and to all a good night!"""

**We have 500 invites to beta test our new GPT-4 powered platform for free. We only ask for honest feedback on any issues encountered and desired features.**

**UPDATE: Super positive responses thus far; thanks everyone. We will be working through every comment and DM - keep them coming! Please continue explaining your use cases, and we'll start selecting and sending invites in batches this week.**

With the application, you can create custom chatbots that effortlessly handle simple questions and complex insights, extracting the meaning and emotion from your data, all while using ChatGPT's entire suite of creative outputs.

Training custom knowledge bases is easy, with compatibility for files (PDFs, TXT, DOC, etc.), websites, videos, images, and more. The fully customizable app enables users to easily add or remove data sources from previous knowledge bases, and all conversations are saved to your account for revisiting later. Embed your custom-trained knowledge bases on your website or share them with friends with just one click.

With accessibility and inclusivity in mind, the app speaks fluently in over 100+ languages and has full voice-to-text capabilities, meaning you can converse with the AI rather than typing (and hear the replies as voice).

To apply, comment or message us with a quick use case of what you'd use the platform for. We'll get back to everyone as soon as we can.

A scary thought. I spent some time playing around on GPT 4 the other day and I was amazed; there wasn‚Äôt anything reasonable that I asked that it couldn‚Äôt answer properly. It solved Leetcode Hards for me. It gave me some pretty decent premises for a story. It maintained a full conversation with me about a single potential character in one of these premises.

What‚Äôs stopping GPT, or just AI in general, from fucking us all over right now? It seems more than capable of doing a lot of white collar jobs already. What‚Äôs stopping it from replacing lawyers, coding-heavy software jobs (people who write code/tests all day), writers, etc. right now? It seems more than capable of handling all these jobs.

Is there regulation stopping it from replacing us? What will be the tipping point that causes the ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù everyone seems to expect? Am I wrong in assuming that AI/GPT is already more than capable of handling the bulk of these jobs?

It would seem to me that it‚Äôs in most companies best interests to be invested in AI as much as possible. Less workers, less salary to pay, happy shareholders. Why haven‚Äôt big tech companies gone through mass layoffs already? Google, Amazon, etc at least should all be far ahead of the curve, right?

""It is difficult to say for sure how long it will take for humanity to implement a universal basic income. However, I believe that the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard will accelerate the need for UBI.

As AI becomes more sophisticated, it will be able to automate more and more tasks that are currently done by humans. This will lead to widespread unemployment, as people are displaced from their jobs by machines. A universal basic income would provide a safety net for those who are unemployed, and it would help to ensure that everyone has a basic level of income.

I believe that UBI is a necessary step in the future of work. As AI continues to develop, it will become increasingly important to have a system in place that ensures that everyone has a basic level of income. UBI would help to create a more just and equitable society, and it would help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Here are some of the factors that will affect the timeline for implementing UBI:

* The rate of technological advancement
* The level of unemployment
* The political will to implement UBI

It is impossible to say for sure when UBI will be implemented, but I believe that it is a necessary step in the future of work.""


Personally, I think it should happen *before* everyone goes into panic mode due to not being able to afford rent.


Edit for the ""bUt wHeRe teH MonIe$ guNna coMe fRomz!?!"" folks, Bard has an answer for you, too:

Fund the UBI via a tax on the corporate entities most responsible for displacement!

Redirect spending from existing social programs that will be no longer required!

Redirect big government spending like military!

Tax the hell out of the 1%!

Bing helped:
""Hi Bard,

OK, I can amend the funding portion of the proposal to include the AI displacement tax.

I have revised the funding section of your proposal to reflect the new source of revenue. Here it is:

## Cost and Funding of UBI

We propose a UBI scheme that would provide every adult citizen with $1,800 per month and every child citizen with $900 per month. This would amount to an annual income of $21,600 for an individual adult and $43,200 for a family of four.

We estimate that this scheme would cost about $4 trillion per year (about 20% of GDP), based on a population of 328 million people (about 255 million adults and 73 million children).

We propose to fund this scheme by using a combination of sources, such as:

* Taxing the wealthy. We propose to increase the income tax rate for the top 1% of earners from 37% to 50%, and introduce a wealth tax of 2% on net worth above $50 million and 3% on net worth above $1 billion. We estimate that this would raise about $1.2 trillion per year.
* Taxing corporations. We propose to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and introduce a minimum tax of 15% on book income (the income reported to shareholders) for large corporations. We also propose to tax digital services (such as online advertising and e-commerce) at a rate of 3%. We estimate that this would raise about $500 billion per year.
* Taxing carbon emissions. We propose to introduce a carbon tax of $50 per ton of CO2 equivalent, and increase it by 5% per year. We estimate that this would raise about $200 billion per year, and also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.
* Redirecting existing government programs. We propose to replace some of the existing means-tested welfare programs, such as SNAP, TANF, and EITC, with UBI. We estimate that this would save about $500 billion per year, and also simplify the social safety net and reduce administrative costs.
* Taxing AI job displacers. We propose to introduce an AI displacement tax of 40% on all companies that are projected to replace 25% or more of their workforce with AI within the next 10 years. This tax would apply to the profits or revenues of these companies, depending on the type and degree of automation involved. We estimate that this would raise about $800 billion per year.

We believe that this combination of sources would be sufficient to fund UBI without increasing the federal deficit or debt. We also believe that this combination of sources would be fair and efficient, as it would shift the tax burden from the poor and middle class to the rich and polluters, and create incentives for economic growth and environmental protection.

I hope that this revised section will help you to fund UBI fully and make your proposal more consistent and coherent.

Thank you for your collaboration and cooperation.

Sincerely,
Bing""


And to the rent hiker/inflationary fearmonger folks:
Sure. Here is a description of the bill to those redditors, only including the information about the inflation prevention and rent caps:

**Universal Basic Income Inflation Prevention Act of 2023**

This legislation would establish a number of measures to prevent inflation in the event of a universal basic income (UBI) being implemented. These measures include:

* **A rent cap of 3% per year.** This would prevent landlords from raising rents exorbitantly in response to increased demand from UBI recipients.
* **A price index for goods and services that are likely to be affected by the UBI.** This would allow the government to monitor prices and make adjustments to the UBI as necessary to prevent inflation.
* **The ability of the Secretary of the Treasury to make adjustments to the UBI as necessary to prevent inflation.** This would give the government flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions.
* **Financial assistance to businesses that are adversely affected by inflation.** This would help to offset the costs of inflation for businesses, which would help to prevent them from passing those costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

We believe that these measures will prevent inflation and ensure that the UBI is a sustainable program that can be maintained over the long term.

And to the ""you're just lazy, learn a trade"" folks:

You know not *everyone* can or wants to be a tradesman, right? The entire industry is toxic to LGBTQ people and the vast majority of people cannot conform to the strict scheduling and physical requirements that are part of such jobs. 
Stop acting like everyone is capable of doing everything you are.

Additionally, Boston Dynamics is coming for all of your labor jobs too, the humanoid robot with fully integrated GPT AI is going to be vastly superior at whatever you think you're special at doing all day everyday that's worth a salary.

The Problem:

I deal with problems, so most of my semester was spent inside my room instead of school, my exam was coming in three days, and I knew none of the lectures.

How would I get through 12 weeks of 3-2 hours of lecture per week in three days?

The Solution: I recognized that this is a majorly studied topic and that it can be something other than course specific to be right; the questions were going to be multiple choice and based on the information in the lecture.

I went to Echo360 and realized that every lecture was transcripted, so I pasted it into Chat gpt and asked it to:

""Analyze this lecture and use your algorithms to decide which information would be relevant as an exam, Make a list.""

The first time I sent it in, the text was too long, so I utilized [https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer](https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer) to summarize almost 7-8k words on average to 900-1000 words, which chat gpt could analyze.

Now that I had the format prepared, I asked Chat Gpt to analyze the summarized transcript and highlight the essential discussions of the lecture.

It did that exactly; I spent the first day Listing the purpose of each discussion and the major points of every lecturer in the manner of 4-5 hours despite all of the content adding up to 24-30 hours.

The next day, I asked Chat gpt to define every term listed as the significant ""point"" in every lecture **only** using the course textbook and the transcript that had been summarized; this took me 4-5 hours to make sure the information was accurate.

I spent the last day completely summarizing the information that chat gpt presented, and it was almost like the exam was an exact copy of what I studied,

The result: I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture

Edit:

This was not a hard course, but it was very extensive, lots of reading and understanding that needed to be applied. Chat gpt excelled in this because the course text was already heavily analyzed and it specializes in understanding text.

Just to clarify, while there is nothing preventing it from acting as ""custom chatbot for any document"", this tool is mainly meant as a B2B SaaS focused towards making support / documentation chatbots for websites of small & medium scale businesses.

\*EDIT 2: I did not expect this level of overwhelming response üôÇ. Thanks a lot for all the love and interest!. I have only limited seats right now so will be prioritising based on use-case. 

\*EDIT 3: This really blew up beyond my expectations. So much that it prompted some people to try and advertise their own products here üòÖ. While there are a lot of great use-cases that fit into what I am trying to focus on here, there are also use-cases here that would most likely benefit more from a different tool or AI models used in a different way. While I cannot offer discounted access to everyone, I will share the link here once I am ready to open it to everyone.  \*

*EDIT 4: ü•∫ I got temporary suspension for sending people links too many times (all the people in my DMs, this is the reason I'm not able to get back to you). I tried to appeal but I don't think it's gonna be accepted. I love Reddit and I respect the decisions they take to keep Reddit a great place. Due to this suspension I'm not able to comment or reach out on DMs.*

17 Apr: I still have one more day to go to get out of the account suspension. I have tons of DM I'm not able to respond to right now. Please be patient and I'll get back to all of you. 

27th Apr: It is now open for anyone to use. You can checkout https://docutalk.co for more information."

I write about the implications of all the crazy new advancements happening in AI for people who don't have the time to do their own research. If you'd like to stay in the know you can [sub here](https://nofil.beehiiv.com/subscribe) :)

&#x200B;

* Some pretty famous people (Musk, Wozniak + others) have signed a letter (?) to pause the work done on AI systems more powerful than gpt4. Very curious to hear what people think about this. On one hand I can understand the sentiment, but hypothetically even if this did happen, will this actually accomplish anything? I somehow doubt it tbh \[[Link](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/)\]
* Here is a concept of Google Brain from back in 2006 (!). You talk with Google and it lets you search for things and even pay for them. Can you imagine if Google worked on something like this back then? Absolutely crazy to see \[[Link](https://twitter.com/ananayarora/status/1640640932654751744)\]
* OpenAI has invested into ‚ÄòNEO‚Äô, a humanoid robot by 1X. They believe it will have a big impact on the future of work. ChatGPT + robots might be coming sooner than expected \[[Link](https://twitter.com/SmokeAwayyy/status/1640560051625803777)\]. They want to create human-level dexterous robots \[[Link](https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1639930481897533440)\]
* There‚Äôs a ‚Äòcode interpreter‚Äô for ChatGPT and its so good, legit could do entire uni assignments in less than an hour. I would‚Äôve loved this in uni. It can even scan dB‚Äôs and analyse the data, create visualisations. Basically play with data using english. Also handles uploads and downloads \[[Link](https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1639055889863720960)\]
* AI is coming to Webflow. Build components instantly using AI. Particularly excited for this since I build websites for people using Webflow. If you need a website built I might be able to help üëÄ¬†\[[Link](https://twitter.com/tayler_odea/status/1640465417817960449)\]
* ChatGPT Plugin will let you find a restaurant, recommend a recipe and build an ingredient list and let you purchase them using Instacart \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1638949234681712643)\]
* Expedia showcased their plugin and honestly already better than any wbesite to book flights. It finds flights, resorts and things to do. I even built a little demo for this before plugins were released üò≠¬†\[[Link](https://twitter.com/ExpediaGroup/status/1638963397361545216)\]. The plugin just uses straight up english. We‚Äôre getting to a point where if you can write, you can create \[[Link](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1639391514085457921)\]
* The Retrieval plugin gives ChatGPT memory. Tell it anything and it‚Äôll remember. So if you wear a mic all day, transcribe the audio and give it to ChatGPT, it‚Äôll remember pretty much anything and everything you say. Remember anything instantly. Crazy use cases for something like this \[[Link](https://twitter.com/isafulf/status/1640071967889035264)\]
* ChadCode plugin lets you do search across your files and create issues into github instantly. The potential for something like this is crazy. Changes coding forever imo \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mathemagic1an/status/1639779842769014784)\]
* The first GPT-4 built iOS game and its actually on the app store. Mate had no experience with Swift, all code generated by AI. Soon the app store will be flooded with AI built games, only a matter of time \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Shpigford/status/1640308252729651202)\]
* Real time detection of feelings with AI. Honestly not sure what the use cases are but I can imagine people are going to do crazy things with stuff like this \[[Link](https://twitter.com/heyBarsee/status/1640257391760474112)\]
* Voice chat with LLama on you Macbook Pro. I wrote about this in my newsletter, we won‚Äôt be typing for much longer imo, we‚Äôll just talk to the AI like Jarvis \[[Link](https://twitter.com/ggerganov/status/1640022482307502085)\]
* Nerfs for cities, looks cool \[[Link](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1640188743649832961)\]

* This is an interesting comment by Mark Cuban. He suggests maybe people with liberal arts majors or other degrees could be prompt engineers to train models for specific use cases and task. Could make a lot of money if this turns out to be a use case. Keen to hear peoples thoughts on this one \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1640162556860940289)\]
* Emad Mostaque, Ceo of Stability AI estimates building a GPT-4 competitor would be roughly 200-300 million if the right people are there \[[Link](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1640052170572832768)\]. He also says it would take at least 12 months to build an open source GPT-4 and it would take crazy focus and work \[[Link](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1640002619040227328)\]
* ‚Ä¢ A 3D artist talks about how their job has changed since Midjourney came out. He can now create a character in 2-3 days compared to weeks before. They hate it but even admit it does a better job than them. It's honestly sad to read because I imagine how fun it is for them to create art. This is going to affect a lot of people in a lot of creative fields \[[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/i_lost_everything_that_made_me_love_my_job/)\]
* This lad built an entire iOS app including payments in a few hours. Relatively simple app but sooo many use cases to even get proof of concepts out in a single day. Crazy times ahead \[[Link](https://twitter.com/pwang_szn/status/1639930203526041601)\]
* Someone is learning how to make 3D animations using AI. This will get streamlined and make some folks a lot of money I imagine \[[Link](https://twitter.com/icreatelife/status/1639698659808886786)\]
* These guys are building an ear piece that will give you topics and questions to talk about when talking to someone. Imagine taking this into a job interview or date üíÄ¬†\[[Link](https://twitter.com/mollycantillon/status/1639870671336644614)\]
* What if you could describe the website you want and AI just makes it. This demo looks so cool dude website building is gona be so easy its crazy \[[Link](https://twitter.com/thekitze/status/1639724609112096768)\]
* Wear glasses that will tell you what to say by listening in to your conversations. When this tech gets better you won‚Äôt even be able to tell if someone is being AI assisted or not \[[Link](https://twitter.com/bryanhpchiang/status/1639830383616487426)\]
* The Pope is dripped tf out. I‚Äôve been laughing at this image for days coz I actually thought it was real the first time I saw it ü§£ \[[Link](https://twitter.com/growing_daniel/status/1639810541547061250)\]
* Levi‚Äôs wants to increase their diversity by showcasing more diverse models, except they want to use AI to create the images instead of actually hiring diverse models. I think we‚Äôre gona see much more of this tbh and it‚Äôs gona get a lot worse, especially for models because AI image generators are getting crazy good \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1639718293605892096)\]. Someone even created an entire AI modelling agency \[[Link](https://www.deepagency.com/)\]
* ChatGPT built a tailwind landing page and it looks really neat \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gabe_ragland/status/1639658044106895360)\]
* This investor talks about how he spoke to a founder who literally took all his advice and fed it to gpt-4. They even made ai generated answers using eleven labs. Hilarious shit tbh \[[Link](https://twitter.com/blader/status/1639847199180988417)\]
* Someone hooked up GPT-4 to Blender and it looks crazy \[[Link](https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1639702313186230272)\]
* This guy recorded a verse and made Kanye rap it \[[Link](https://twitter.com/rpnickson/status/1639813074176679938)\]
* gpt4 saved this dogs life. Doctors couldn‚Äôt find what was wrong with the dog and gpt4 suggested possible issues and turned out to be right. Crazy stuff \[[Link](https://twitter.com/peakcooper/status/1639716822680236032)\]
* A research paper suggests you can improve gpt4 performance by 30% by simply having it consider ‚Äúwhy were you wrong‚Äù. It then keeps generating new prompts for itself taking this reflection into account. The pace of learning is really something else \[[Link](https://twitter.com/blader/status/1639728920261201921)\]
* You can literally asking gpt4 for a plugin idea, have it code it, then have it put it up on replit. It‚Äôs going to be so unbelievably easy to create a new type of single use app soon, especially if you have a niche use case. And you could do this with practically zero coding knowledge. The technological barrier to solving problems using code is disappearing before our eyes  \[[Link](https://twitter.com/eerac/status/1639332649536716824)\]
* A soon to be open source AI form builder. Pretty neat \[[Link](https://twitter.com/JhumanJ/status/1639233285556514817)\]
* Create entire videos of talking AI people. When this gets better we wont be able to distinguish between real and AI \[[Link](https://twitter.com/christianortner/status/1639360983192723474)\]
* Someone made a cityscape with AI then asked Chatgpt to write the code to port it into VR. From words to worlds \[[Link](https://twitter.com/ClaireSilver12/status/1621960309220032514)\]
* Someone got gpt4 to write an entire book. It‚Äôs not amazing but its still a whole book. I imagine this will become much easier with plugins and so much better with gpt5 & gpt6 \[[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/120oq1x/i_asked_gpt4_to_write_a_book_the_result_echoes_of/)\]
* Make me an app - Literally ask for an app and have it built. Unbelievable software by Replit. When AI gets better this will be building whole, functioning apps with a single prompt. World changing stuff \[[Link](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1639355638097776640)\]
* Langchain is building open source AI plugins, they‚Äôre doing great work in the open source space. Can‚Äôt wait to see where this goes \[[Link](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1639351690251100160)\]. Another example of how powerful and easy it is to build on Langchain \[[Link](https://twitter.com/pwang_szn/status/1638707301073956864)\]
* Tesla removed sensors and are just using cameras + AI \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Scobleizer/status/1639161161982816258)\]
* Edit 3d scenes with text in real time \[[Link](https://twitter.com/javilopen/status/1638848842631192579)\]
* GPT4 is so good at understanding different human emotions and emotional states it can even effectively manage a fight between a couple. We‚Äôve already seen many people talk about how much its helped them for therapy. Whether its good, ethical or whatever the fact is this has the potential to help many people without being crazy expensive. Someone will eventually create a proper company out of this and make a gazillion bucks \[[Link](https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1638932491594797057)\]
* You can use plugins to process video clips, so many websites instantly becoming obsolete \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1638971232443076609)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1639002271701692417)\]
* The way you actually write plugins is describing an api in plain english. Chatgpt figures out the rest \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1638967450510458882)\]. Don‚Äôt believe me? Read the docs yourself \[[Link](https://twitter.com/frantzfries/status/1639019934779953153)\]
* This lad created an iOS shortcut that replaces Siri with Chatgpt \[[Link](https://mobile.twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1640414764852711425)\]
* Zapier supports 5000+ apps. Chatgpt + Zapier = infinite use cases \[[Link](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1638968791487901712)\]
* I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all already seen the paper saying how gpt4 shows sparks of AGI but I‚Äôll link it anyway. ‚Äúwe believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system.‚Äù \[[Link](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1638805126524592134)\]
* This lad created an AI agent that, given a task, creates sub tasks for itself and comes up with solutions for them. It‚Äôs actually crazy to see this in action, I highly recommend watching this clip \[[Link](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima/status/1640934508047503362)\]. Here‚Äôs the link to the ‚Äúpaper‚Äù and his summary of how it works \[[Link](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima/status/1640934493489070080)\]
* Someone created a tool that listens to your job interview and tells you what to say. Rip remote interviews \[[Link](https://mobile.twitter.com/localghost/status/1640448469285634048)\]
* Perplexity just released their app, a Chatgpt alternative on your phone. Instant answers + cited sources \[[Link](https://mobile.twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1640745555872579584)\]"

51,11rfkd6,chatgpt,GPT-4,comments,2023-03-15 00:12:18,After reading the GPT-4 Research paper I can say for certain I am more concerned than ever. Screenshots inside - Apparently the release is not endorsed by their Red Team?,SouthRye,False,0.94,1397,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11rfkd6/after_reading_the_gpt4_research_paper_i_can_say/,756,1678839138.0,"I decided to spend some time to sit down and actually look over the latest report on GPT-4. I've been a big fan of the tech and have used the API to build smaller pet projects but after reading some of the safety concerns in this latest research I can't help but feel the tech is moving WAY too fast.

[Per Section 2.0 these systems are already exhibiting novel behavior like long term independent planning and Power-Seeking.](https://preview.redd.it/s010qrntosna1.png?width=1489&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bfb31f5835e7b348595043706af052f8b83cf144)

To test for this in GPT-4 ARC basically hooked it up with root access, gave it a little bit of money (I'm assuming crypto) and access to its OWN API. This theoretically would allow the researchers to see if it would create copies of itself and crawl the internet to try and see if it would improve itself or generate wealth. This in itself seems like a dangerous test but I'm assuming ARC had some safety measures in place.

[GPT-4 ARC test.](https://preview.redd.it/ozi42pntosna1.png?width=1463&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e9ce2a83a9d6d7c270789d8cbdb9d03af4b901e3)

ARCs linked report also highlights that many ML systems are not fully under human control and that steps need to be taken now for safety.

[from ARCs report.](https://preview.redd.it/xrryirntosna1.png?width=1321&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ef69b27e135814e34456ab1b48dd36c1b3c251c5)

Now here is one part that really jumped out at me.....

Open AI's Red Team has a special acknowledgment in the paper that they do not endorse GPT-4's release or OpenAI's deployment plans - this is odd to me but can be seen as a just to protect themselves if something goes wrong but to have this in here is very concerning on first glance.

[Red Team not endorsing Open AI's deployment plan or their current policies.](https://preview.redd.it/akw6montosna1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a15301c3f0ffcd38b8cab7c15f9bfd8294518d9a)

Sam Altman said about a month ago not to expect GPT-4 for a while. However given Microsoft has been very bullish on the tech and has rolled it out across Bing-AI this does make me believe they may have decided to sacrifice safety for market dominance which is not a good reflection when you compare it to Open-AI's initial goal of keeping safety first. Especially as releasing this so soon seems to be a total 180 to what was initially communicated at the end of January/ early Feb. Once again this is speculation but given how close they are with MS on the actual product its not out of the realm of possibility that they faced outside corporate pressure.

Anyways thoughts? I'm just trying to have a discussion here (once again I am a fan of LLM's) but this report has not inspired any confidence around Open AI's risk management.

While utilizing ChatGPT API**

ChatGPT: Certainly! Here's an overview of how you can build a web app that takes links to YouTube videos and lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT while utilizing ChatGPT API:

Set up a backend server: You'll need to set up a backend server that can handle incoming requests from the frontend of the web app. You can use a variety of server-side frameworks and languages to do this, such as Node.js, Python, or Ruby on Rails.

1. Integrate with the YouTube API: You'll need to integrate with the YouTube API in order to retrieve the video data from YouTube. Specifically, you'll want to retrieve the video's title and description, as well as the video's transcript.
2. Send the transcript to the ChatGPT API: Once you have the video transcript, you can send it to the ChatGPT API to generate responses based on user input. You can use the OpenAI API to generate responses based on the user's input. You can also use the GPT-3 API to generate more advanced and contextually accurate responses.
3. Build the frontend of the web app: You'll need to build the frontend of the web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use a frontend framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js to make the development process easier. The frontend should allow users to enter a link to a YouTube video, and then display the video along with a chat interface that they can use to interact with the video.
4. Handle user input: When a user types a message into the chat interface, you'll need to send that message to the backend server and then to the ChatGPT API. Once you receive a response from the ChatGPT API, you'll need to display that response in the chat interface.
5. Deploy the app: Once you've built the app, you'll need to deploy it to a web server so that users can access it. You can use a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud to host the app.

**Me: Is it possible to code this web app in javascript and python?**

ChatGPT: Yes, it is definitely possible to build a web app that lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT using both JavaScript and Python.

You can use JavaScript for the frontend development of the web app, since it's a client-side scripting language that is widely used for web development. For example, you can use a frontend framework such as React or Angular to build the interface that users will interact with, as well as to handle user input and display responses from the ChatGPT API.

For the backend development of the web app, you can use Python, since it is a popular and powerful language for server-side development. Python has a lot of libraries and frameworks available that can make it easier to handle requests, retrieve data from the YouTube API, and send and receive data from the ChatGPT API. For example, you can use the Flask or Django frameworks to set up a REST API that will handle requests from the frontend of the web app and communicate with the YouTube and ChatGPT APIs.

**Me: Thank you! Can you please write the frontend code for me in Javascript?**

ChatGPT: Sure, here's an example of how you can build the frontend of a web app that lets users interact with YouTube videos like it is ChatGPT using JavaScript and React:

Image of code snippet ChatGPT provided: [https://ibb.co/cwfh15V](https://ibb.co/cwfh15V) (It did the same thing for the backend code in python and css)

At this point, I input the code into Replit, which would then identify any errors and I would go back into ChatGPT and explain the errors, then it would reply with correct code.

Major errors were hard to come by and memory lapses were almost a complete non-issue. In the past week or so I‚Äôve began to feel like it‚Äôs performance has regressed to be more reminiscent of GPT-3.5. I‚Äôve begun to question the claim about 12 pages worth of token memory with GPT-4 as it now not only seems to have more frequent issues remembering prompts in their entirety past around 5-6 pages of tokens, but also disregards certain parts of a prompt that I even emphasize in its responses. Was wondering if anyone else was experiencing this too?

EDIT: Did not expect this big of a response so let me help address some of the most frequent responses I‚Äôve seen in here.

-I don‚Äôt care that this has apparently been asked before. Not everyone is on Reddit all the time. If you‚Äôre on here so much that you constantly see this question I would recommend closing Reddit and going outside for a few hours as well as removing the stick from your ass.

-People are asking this question probably because they‚Äôve been utilizing GPT-4 from their *paid* GPT Plus subscription since it‚Äôs release and therefore it wouldn‚Äôt be far-fetched that someone utilizing a tool on a daily basis would notice if it starts to become dull, especially if they keep using that tool for the same jobs. I have a feeling most of the people saying ‚Äúno the hype has just worn off/the honeymoon period has ended‚Äù literally don‚Äôt even have GPT-4, much less have had it since it‚Äôs release.

-Nobody wants to comb through hundreds of old chat histories and draw up a screenshot comparing it to a similar recent conversation in a way that‚Äôs irrefutable just to prove a point to you. See above."

GPT-4 not only handles that challenge just fine, it gets a little condescending when you insist it is wrong.

GPT-3.5 was exciting because it was an order of magnitude more intelligent than its predecessor and could interact kind of like a human. GPT-4 is not only an order of magnitude more intelligent than GPT-3.5, but it is also more intelligent than most humans. More importantly, it knows that. 

People need to understand that prompt engineering works very differently depending on the version you are interacting with. We could resolve a lot of discussions with that little piece of information."

The goal of this project was to have GPT-4 generate an entire novel from scratch, including the title, genre, story, characters, settings, and all the writing, with no human input. It is impossible currently to do this using a single prompt, but what is possible is to supply a series of prompts that give structure to the process and allow it to complete this large task, one step at a time. However, in order to ensure that all the creative work is done by GPT-4, prompts are not allowed to make specific references to the *content* of the book, only the book‚Äôs *structure*. The intention is that the process should be simple, mechanical and possible (in principle) to fully automate. Each time the process is repeated from the beginning, it should create another entirely new book, based solely on GPT-4‚Äôs independent creative choices.

The result: ***Echoes of Atlantis***, a fantasy adventure novel with 12 chapters and 115 pages, written over 10 days, from the day GPT-4 was released until now.

# Insights/Techniques

My main insights I figured out in the course of doing this project:

* **Iterative refinement:** Start with a high level outline. Make a detailed chapter outline. Then write a draft version of the full chapter (this will be much shorter than desired). Then expand each scene into a longer, more detailed scene.
* **Bounding (outside-in):** GPT-4 loves to go too far ahead, writing about parts of the book that aren‚Äôt supposed to happen yet. The key to preventing this is to have it first write the **first parts**, then the **last parts**, then fill in the **middle parts**. The last part prevents it from going too far ahead, and the first parts in turn bound the last part of the previous section. Bounding is used at every level of refinement except the top level.
* **Single prompt:** Often, by using a single large prompt, rather than a running conversation, you can flexibly determine exactly what information will be included in the input buffer, and ensure that all of it is relevant to the current task. I‚Äôve crafted this approach to squeeze as much relevant info as I can into the token buffer.
* **Continuity notes:** Ask it to take notes on important details to remember for continuity and consistency as it goes. Begin with continuity notes summarized from the previous scene, and then fold in additional continuity notes from the previous continuity notes. Continuity Notes will tend to grow over time; if they become too long, ask it to summarize them.
* **Revising outlines:** In some cases, the AI improvises in its writing, for example moving some of the Chapter 5 scenes into Chapter 4, which breaks the book. To resolve this, I ask it after each chapter to go back and update its earlier, higher-level outlines and regenerate the opening and closing scenes of each chapter before continuing. This is very similar to how real authors revise their outlines over time.
* **Data cleanup:** Sometimes outputs will do things a little weird, like copy labels from the input buffer like ‚ÄúOpening Paragraph‚Äù, or forget to number the scenes, or start numbering at zero, or add a little bit of stray text at the beginning. Currently I clean these up manually but a fully automated solution would have to cope with these.

# Example prompts

These are just a few examples. For full details, see my [Research Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/108oqbYW4BPc0hfHQDyXpk8RlsNmXJaJzi2U6G1tRLTg/edit#).

**Level 1: Top-level outline**

**Me:** Please write a high-level outline for a book. Include a list of characters and a short description of each character. Include a list of chapters and a short summary of what happens in each chapter. You can pick any title and genre you want.

**Level 1: Updating outline after each chapter**

**Me:** Please edit and update the high-level outline for the book below, taking into account what has already happened in Chapter 1.

**Level 2: Scenes (bounding)**

**Me:** Please write a detailed outline describing the first scene of each chapter. It should describe what happens in that opening scene and set up the story for the rest of the chapter. Do not summarize the entire chapter, only the first scene.

**Me:** Write a detailed outline describing the final, last scene of each chapter. It should describe what happens at the very end of the chapter, and set up the story for the opening scene of the next chapter, which will come immediately afterwards.

**Level 2: Scenes**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following opening and final scenes for Chapter 1, write a detailed chapter outline giving all the scenes in the chapter and a short description of each. Begin the outline with the Opening Scene below, and finish the outline with the Final Scene below.

**Level 3: Rough draft**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and following detailed chapter outline for Chapter 1, write a first draft of Chapter 1. Label each of the scenes. Stop when you reach the end of Chapter 1. It should set up the story for Chapter 2, which will come immediately afterwards. It should be written in a narrative style and should be long, detailed, and engaging.

**Level 4: Paragraphs (bounding)**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following draft of Chapter 1, imagine that you have expanded this draft into a longer, more detailed chapter. For each scene, give me both the first opening paragraph, and the last, final paragraph of that longer, more detailed version. Label them as Opening Paragraph and Final Paragraph. The opening paragraph should introduce the scene. The final paragraph should set up the story for the following scene, which will come immediately afterwards. The last paragraph of the final scene should set the story up for the following chapter, which will come immediately afterwards.

**Level 4: Paragraphs**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following draft of Chapter 1, write a longer, more detailed version of Scene 1. The scene must begin and end with the following paragraphs: (opening and closing paragraphs here)

**Continuity Notes**

**Me:** Please briefly note any important details or facts from the scene below that you will need to remember while writing the rest of the book, in order to ensure continuity and consistency. Label these Continuity Notes.

**Me:** Combine and summarize these notes with the existing previous Continuity Notes below.

# Reflections on the result

Although in many ways the work did come together as a coherent work of fiction, following its own outline and proceeding at the pacing that its own outline dictated, and some parts were genuinely exciting and interesting to read (particularly the earliest and latest chapters), I‚Äôd hesitate to call it a good book. It‚Äôs still got some weird and interesting problems to it:

* **Reference without introduction:** Occasionally, the AI will reference things that have not really been introduced/explained yet, like Langdon knowing about Lord Malakhar in Chapter 4, or Aria having a physical pendant after her dream of Queen Neria. It feels like you must have missed something.
* **Seams around opening/closing paragraphs:** Because opening and final paragraphs are written before the rest of the scene, sometimes they don‚Äôt flow smoothly from the rest, or they even end up redundant. An additional pass of some kind could help clean this up. Likewise, sometimes the transition between chapters could seem abrupt, like going from Chapter 8 to 9 (fighting Malakhar in the labyrinth to just suddenly a passage to Atlantis opening).
* **Forgetting certain details:** Although certain details are maintained in the Continuity Notes or in the outline, others it decides to drop, and then they can never be referenced again, since they are no longer in the input buffer. A good example of this is the compass Aria got as a graduation present, which felt a lot like a Chekov‚Äôs gun that was never mentioned again. Another is the particular unique weapons they purchased at the outset, which were never used. The only clear solution is either a larger buffer or a long-term memory solution.
* **Rearrangements:** The AI moved some parts from later chapters into earlier chapters, despite my best attempts to bound it, such as the early scenes on the island which moved from Chapter 5 to Chapter 4, and the early labyrinth scenes which were moved from Chapter 6 to Chapter 5. The only real way to address this was to ask it to edit and update its high-level outlines afterwards. This is similar to what human authors do ‚Äî they rarely treat their outlines as static and inviolable.
* **Pacing:** To me, the labyrinth chapters felt like a bit of a slog. It was one trap chamber after another, for a very long time. These did fit the original outline, so the original outline was part of the problem, but there are also ways it could have made the labyrinth feel new and different. This feels like a creative writing mistake by GPT-4 to me.
* **Overly regular structure:** Almost invariably the AI chose to write 6‚Äì8 scenes per chapter, and about 1‚Äì2 pages per scene. This feels less organic than a lot of human-written works where some scenes/chapters are short and others are longer. It might have been better to develop a dynamic expansion structure where it continues to expand until it is somehow satisfied that it has achieved the desired level of detail.
* **Varying level of detail:** On a related note, some scenes were quite detailed, including dialog and minute actions, while others (even more important scenes) seemed to breeze right over big important moments with a summary. Again, I think some kind of dynamic expansion to achieve a consistent level of detail could help here.

# Some fun notes

* In Scene 3 of Chapter 5, GPT-4 spontaneously wrote an original riddle in the labyrinth that they had to solve: ‚ÄúWithin my walls I hold a sea, / Yet not a drop of water you‚Äôll see. / Many paths there are to roam, / But only one will lead you home. / What am I?‚Äù Alex figured it out, the answer is ‚Äúa map‚Äù.
* In at least three places, GPT-4 slipped in sly references to ‚Äúthe next chapter in her life‚Äù or ‚Äúthe next chapter in their adventure‚Äù right as the chapter was ending. Very meta.

# Frequently asked questions

**Q: Didn‚Äôt you exhibit a lot of authorial control in choosing which answers to keep and which ones to throw away?**

Actually, regenerating responses was rare, and I only ever did it if I either found a serious problem with the process or if there was a serious logical problem in the book that I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to resolve with process changes. This happened at most 4‚Äì5 times in all. At least 95% of the time, the text in the book is the very first response I got back from GPT-4. You can see this in the notes in my research log.

**Q: This book isn‚Äôt very good. I don‚Äôt think professional authors will have very much to worry about.**

True, but that‚Äôs not the point. It‚Äôs a proof of concept: can an AI write an entire book, of 100+ pages, from beginning to end, while remaining coherent and following its original planned outline? Without needing humans to step in and tell it what to do with the story or the characters? The answer is yes. Moreover, I think it‚Äôs pretty enjoyable in some parts. And of course, the next GPT model will only be a better author.

**Q: Isn‚Äôt there a rate limit on GPT-4 queries on ChatGPT Plus? How could you have written 100+ pages in 10 days?**

Yes, and I hit it many times. However, because both my prompts and ChatGPT‚Äôs responses were very long, I was able to squeeze the absolute maximum text out of every prompt. Moreover, GPT-4 accepts a much longer prompt input than either GPT-3 or Bing did, which helps a ton for ensuring I can include as much context as possible. Also, the limit was higher in early days right after GPT-4 release.

**Q: Is GPT-4 needed for this? How does it compare to GPT-3?**

I tried this with GPT-3 before and encountered issues, mostly around writing too far ahead in the story and getting off-track. Bounding techniques might help, I haven't tried yet - partly because it's a pain to deal with the smaller input buffer. Needs further investigation.

**Q: Can I use your book or your process or your prompts?**

Please feel free, I did this for fun in my free time and I release all of this into the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero Waiver ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)) and disclaim any IP rights.

I know some of you out there have been working on similar book projects, so if you have, I‚Äôd appreciate any additional insight you have into what works and what doesn‚Äôt. And if you try out any of my techniques or prompts for yourself, let me know if they‚Äôre helpful.

And for those who take the time to read the book, let me know your thoughts on how it turned out! You can be honest, I know it's still got plenty of issues. :)"

# News

* Stanford/Google researchers basically created a mini westworld. They simulated a game society with agents that were able to have memories, relationships and make reflections. When they analysed the behaviour, they measured to be ‚Äòmore human‚Äô than actual humans. Absolutely wild shit. The architecture is so simple too. I wrote about this in my newsletter yday and man the applications and use cases for this in like gaming or VR and basically creating virtual worlds is going to be insane (nsfw use cases are scary to even think about). Someone said they cant wait to add capitalism and a sense of eventual death or finite time and.. that would be very interesting to see.

It can't do simple questions GPT-4 can handle without difficulty. I asked it a five-letter word the opposite of ""start,"" and its answer was ""The opposite of ""start"" could be stop."" When I reminded I asked for a 5 letter word, it just said ""I apologize for misunderstanding your initial request. What word were you referring to? Can you please provide more context or clarify your question?"" And we just went in circles.

**OP is using something weaker than GPT-3.5.** Even GPT-3.5 can remember previous requests and at least attempt to change its answer-- after three prompts, I can get it to find a decent word that fits the parameters, ""pause."" 

JackChat could NOT do that. I don't know why OP is deceiving everyone and someone even bought them a platinum award lol.

# News

&#x200B;

* Stanford/Google researchers basically created a mini westworld. They simulated a game society with agents that were able to have memories, relationships and make reflections. When they analysed the behaviour, they measured to be ‚Äòmore human‚Äô than actual humans. Absolutely wild shit. The architecture is so simple too. I wrote about this in my newsletter yday and man the applications and use cases for this in like gaming or VR and basically creating virtual worlds is going to be insane (nsfw use cases are scary to even think about). Someone said they cant wait to add capitalism and a sense of eventual death or finite time and.. that would be very interesting to see. Link to watching the game \[[Link](https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/#)\] Link to the paper \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf)\]
* OpenAI released an implementation of Consistency Models. We could actually see real time image generation with these (from my understanding, correct me if im wrong). Link to github \[[Link](https://github.com/openai/consistency_models)\]. Link to paper \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469)\]

I found this [story on Twitter,](https://twitter.com/peakcooper/status/1639716822680236032?s=) and I thought this subreddit would love it as much as I did.

&#x200B;

[*#GPT4*](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPT4?src=hashtag_click) *saved my dog's life.  After my dog got diagnosed with a tick-borne disease,  the vet started her on the proper treatment, and despite a serious anemia, her condition seemed to be improving relatively well.  After a few days however, things took a turn for the worse...*

*I noticed her gums were very pale, so we rushed back to the vet.  The blood test revealed an even more severe anemia, even worse than the first day we came in.  The vet ran more tests to rule out any other co-infections associated with tick-borne diseases, but came up negative*

*At this point, the dog's condition was getting worse and worse, and the vet had no clue what it could be.   They suggested we wait and see what happens, which wasn't an acceptable answer to me, so we rushed to another clinic to get a second opinion*

*In the meantime, it occurred to me that medical diagnostics seemed like the sort of thing GPT4 could potentially be really good at, so I described the situation in great detail.  I gave it the actual transcribed blood test results from multiple days, and asked for a diagnosis*  


https://preview.redd.it/8s74h9rnu9qa1.jpg?width=1716&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62ce302708061f68c8e46930f93b85d42ebedcae

*Despite the ""I am not a veterinarian..."" disclaimer, it complied.  Its interpretation was spot on, and it suggested there could be other underlying issues contributing to the anemia*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lt9fti6qu9qa1.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4ba512f79bcb48d749dbe1ab5a160c8ef5ef441

*So I asked it what other underlying issues could fit this scenario, and it gave me a list of options.  I knew the 4DX test ruled out other coinfections, and an ultrasound ruled out internal bleeding, so that left us with one single diagnosis that fit everything so far: IMHA*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/293rlzuru9qa1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=5095d1001e5051b3787dbc7a1a72a0b01560e159

*When we reached the second vet, I asked if it's possible it might be IMHA.  The vet agreed that it's a possible diagnosis. They drew blood, where they noticed visible agglutination.  After numerous other tests, the diagnosis was confirmed. GPT4 was right.*

*We started the dog on the proper treatment, and she's made almost a full recovery now.  Note that both of these diseases are very common. Babesiosis is the #1 tick-borne disease, and IMHA is a common complication of it, especially for this breed*

*I don't know why the first vet couldn't make the correct diag., either incompetence, or poor mgmt.  GPT-3.5 couldn't place the proper diag., but GPT4 was smart enough to do it.  I can't imagine what medical diagnostics will look like 20 years from now.*

*The most impressive part was how well it read and interpreted the blood test results. I simply transcribed the CBC test values from a piece of paper, and it gave a step by step explanation and interpretation along with the reference ranges (which I confirmed all correct)*

For one coffee a month, I'll send you 2 newsletters a week with all of the most important & interesting stories like these written in a digestible way. You can [sub here](https://nofil.beehiiv.com/upgrade)

Edit: For those wondering why its paid - I hate ads and don't want to rely on running ads in my newsletter. I'd rather try and get paid to do all this work like this than force my readers to read sponsorship bs in the middle of a newsletter. Call me old fashioned but I just hate ads with a passion

Edit 2: If you'd like to tip you can tip here [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil). Absolutely no pressure to do so, appreciate all the comments and support üôè

You can read the free newsletter [here](https://nofil.beehiiv.com/)

Fun fact: I had to go through over 100 saved tabs to collate all of these and it took me quite a few hours

Edit: So many people ask why I don't get chatgpt to write this for me. Chatgpt doesn't have access to the internet. Plugins would help but I don't have access yet so I have to do things the old fashioned way - like a human.

# Google + DeepMind

* Google Brain and Deepmind have combined to form Google Deepmind. This is a big deal. Expecting big things from Google. Yes we‚Äôve all been shitting on Google recently but we have to remember, they have most of the worlds data. The amount of things they can do with it should be insane. Will be very interesting to see what they come up with \[[Link](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/announcing-google-deepmind?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=GDM)\] Funnily enough over the last 13 years they went from DeepMind ‚Üí Google DeepMind ‚Üí DeepMind ‚Üí Google DeepMind
* Google announced Project Magi, an AI powered search engine with the purpose of creating a more personalised user experience. It will apparently offer options for purchases, research and will be more of a conversational bot. Other things Google is working on include AI powered Google Earth, music search chatbot, a language learning tutor and a few other things \[[Link](https://me.mashable.com/tech/27276/project-magi-googles-team-of-160-working-on-adding-new-features-to-search-engine)\]
* Google‚Äôs Bard can now write code for you, explain code, debug code and export it Colab \[[Link](https://blog.google/technology/ai/code-with-bard/)\]
* DeepMind developed an AI program that created a 3D mapping of all 200 million proteins known to science \[[Link](https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1647745216986710018)\]

# Bark + Whisper JAX

* Bark is an incredible text-to-audio model and can also generate in multiple languages \[[Link](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark)\]
* Whisper Jax makes transcribing audio unbelievably fast, the fastest model on the web. Transcribe 30 min of audio in \~30 secs. Link to Github \[[Link](https://github.com/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax)\] Link to try online on huggingface \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax)\]

&#x200B;

# Open Source

* Open Assistant - just wow - is an open source Chat AI. The entire dataset is free and open source, you can find the code and all here \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant)\]. You can play around with the chat here \[[Link](https://t.co/5lcaGKfu3i)\]. For an open source model I think its brilliant. I got it to make website copy and compared it to gpt-4 and honestly there was hardly a difference in this case. Very exciting. We‚Äôre getting closer and closer to a point where we‚Äôll have open source models as powerful as gpt3.5 & 4. Video discussing it \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddG2fM9i4Kk)\]
* Stability AI announced StableLM - their Language Models. They‚Äôve released 3B and 7B models with 15-65B models to come. Don‚Äôt be confused - this isn‚Äôt a chat bot like ChatGPT - that will come as they release RLHF models and go from StableLM to StableChat \[[Link](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM/)\]. Another great win for open source
* LlamaAcademy is an open source repo designed to teach models how to read API docs and then produce code specifically for certain API‚Äôs. This type of thing will be very important in the coming adoption of AI \[[Link](https://github.com/danielgross/LlamaAcademy)\]. Still very experimental atm
* Detailed instructions on how to run LLaMA on Macbook M1 \[[Link](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/llama-7b-m2)\]
* LLaVA is an open source model that can also interpret images. It‚Äôs good \[[Link](https://twitter.com/ChunyuanLi/status/1648222285889953793)\]. Link to try it out \[[Link](https://llava-vl.github.io/)\]
* MiniGPT-4 - an open source model for visual tasks. It can even generate html given a picture of a design of a website, albeit basic. The fact that this is open source is awesome, can‚Äôt wait for these open source models to get even better. \[[Link](https://minigpt-4.github.io/)\] Also provide a pretrained MiniGPT-4 aligned with Vicuna-7B \[[Link](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4)\]
* Red Pajama is a project to create open source LLMs. They‚Äôve just released a 1.2 trillion token dataset. This is actually a very big deal but because there's no demo, just a dataset its flown under the radar. They‚Äôre alrdy training ontop of it right now. I hope this will also work for commercial use as well \[[Link](https://twitter.com/togethercompute/status/1647917989264519174)\]

&#x200B;

# Elon's TruthGPT

* Elon Musk went on Tucker Carlson and spoke about AI. He‚Äôs building his own AI called TruthGPT - a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe. Whatever that means. This comes only a few weeks after he called for a pause on AI advancements. Why‚Äôs he doing this? He was scared that Google/DeepMind were winning and would lead to unsafe AGI because Larry Page (co-founder of Google) called Elon a ‚Äúspecies-ist‚Äù for being pro human because he wants AI to be safe for humanity. Page has openly stated that Google's goal is to create AGI \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm04Dvky3w8)\]

&#x200B;

# OpenAI TED Talk

* President and Co-Founder of OpenAI, Greg Brokman did a TED talk and its worth a watch. He showcases the potential for plugins in chatgpt and ends with ‚ÄúWe all need to become literate‚Ä¶together I believe we can achieve the OpenAI mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity‚Äù. Another interesting point is that chatgpt or plugins is essentially ‚Äúa unified language interface on top of tools‚Äù. Genuinely wonder what they have access to behind the scenes \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=C_78DM8fG6E)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mezaoptimizer/status/1648195392557727744)\]

# Games

* AI in Game dev - You can now connect any hugging face model in Unity. Open source API integration \[[Link](https://github.com/huggingface/unity-api)\]. This concept shows working AI in a game \[[Link](https://twitter.com/mayfer/status/1648277360599502850?s=20)\]. Video showing how to connect the api \[[Link](https://twitter.com/dylan_ebert_/status/1648759808630353921?s=20)\]
* A demo of using ChatGPT NPC‚Äôs in virtual reality \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xA5K7fRmig)\]
* Someone made a game where you guess if the image of a lady is real or AI. I got 13/17 lol \[[Link](https://caitfished.com/)\]. A good way to show someone the power of AI but also highlights just how used to were seeing fake looking pics on social media
* AI powered 3D editor, looks cool \[[Link](https://dup.ai/)\]

&#x200B;

# Music

* The music industry is about to undergo crazy change with AI songs of Drake, The Weekend and others popping up and they are getting very good \[[Link](https://twitter.com/lostlifon/status/1647887306874060800?s=20)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/WeirdAiGens/status/1648648898628526082)\]. Kanye, Drake singing Call Me Maybe & kpop is one of the funniest thing I‚Äôve heard in a while lol \[[Link](https://twitter.com/brickroad7/status/1648492914383917058)\] \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLWa5xC7CIE)\] \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RVPh0KaC7U4)\]. Obviously music companies are fighting against this very hard. Will be very interesting how this plays out re artists essentially offering their voices as models to be bought or something like that \[[Link](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/universal-music-group-responds-to-fake-drake-ai-track-streaming-platforms-have-a-fundamental-responsibility/)\]

&#x200B;

# Text-to-video

* NVIDIA released their text-to-video research and it is pretty good. Text-to-video is getting better so fast, its going to be a kind of scary when it becomes as good as photo generation now. Being able to create a realistic video of absolutely anything sounds crazy when you consider what some people will do with it \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/VideoLDM/)\]
* Adobe released their text-to-video editing and it looks pretty cool actually. You can generate sound effects/music clips & auto generate storyboards + a lot more \[[Link](https://twitter.com/jnack/status/1648027068888920065)\]

&#x200B;

# AR + AI

* AR + AI for cooking, looks cool \[[Link](https://twitter.com/metaverseplane/status/1648911560268546048)\]
* AR + AI for 3D knowledge mapping, looks so cool. If you have a metaquestvr you can download and try it \[[Link](https://twitter.com/yiliu_shenburke/status/1645818274981072897)\]

&#x200B;

# Law

* Two comedians made an AI tom brady say funny stuff. He threatened to sue. This is going to be very common going forward \[[Link](https://nypost.com/2023/04/20/tom-brady-threatened-to-sue-comedians-over-ai-standup-video/)\]
* A german magazine did an ‚Äúinterview‚Äù with an AI Michael Schumacher and his family is now gona sue them \[[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691415/michael-schumacher-fake-ai-generated-interview-racing-f1-lawsuit)\]
* An AI copilot for lawyers \[[Link](https://www.spellbook.legal/)\]
* A lawyer discusses how he uses ChatGPT daily, an interesting thread \[[Link](https://twitter.com/SMB_Attorney/status/1648302869517312001)\]

&#x200B;

# Finance

* Finchat is chatgpt for finance - ask questions about public companies. It provides reasoning, sources and data \[[Link](https://finchat.io/)\]

&#x200B;

# Wearable AI devices

* Humane, a company founded by some vet ex Apple folks just showed what they‚Äôre building - an AI powered projector that just sits with you and hears what you hear, sees what you see. It can translate anything you say in real time, give advice on what you can/cant eat and a whole lot more. Very interesting to see how AI wearables will look like and how they‚Äôll change daily life in the years to come. Still a bit skeptical tbh but only time will tell \[[Link](https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-ai-wearable-camera-sensor-projector-video-demo)\]

&#x200B;

# Other News + Tools

The fully customizable app enables users to easily add or remove data sources from previous knowledge bases, and all conversations are saved to your account for revisiting later. Embed your custom-trained knowledge bases on your website or share them with friends with just one click.

With accessibility and inclusivity in mind, the app speaks fluently in over 100+ languages and has full voice-to-text capabilities, meaning you can converse with the AI rather than typing (and hear the replies as voice).

To apply, comment or message us with a quick use case of what you'd use the platform for. We'll get back to everyone as soon as we can.

## Godfather of AI leaves Google

* Geoffrey Hinton is one of the pioneers of AI, his work in the field has led to the AI systems we have today. He left Google recently and is talking about the dangers of continuing our progress and is worried we‚Äôll build AI that is smarter than us and will have its own motives. he even said he somewhat regrets his entire life‚Äôs work \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/02/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-quits-google-warns-dangers-of-machine-learning)\] What is most intriguing about this situation is another og of the industry (Yann LeCun) completely disagrees with his stance and is openly talking about. A very interesting thing seeing 2 masterminds have such different perspectives on what we can & can‚Äôt do and what AI can & will be capable of. Going in depth about this and what they think and what they're worried about in my newsletter

## Writers Strike

* The writers guild is striking and one of their conditions is to ban AI from being used. So far apparently their proposals have been rejected and they‚Äôve been offered an ""annual meeting to discuss advances in technology.‚Äù \[[Link](https://time.com/6277158/writers-strike-ai-wga-screenwriting/)\] \[[Link](https://twitter.com/adamconover/status/1653272590310600705)\]

## Government

* Big AI CEO‚Äôs met with the pres and other officials at the white house. Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic CEO‚Äôs all there \[[Link](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-microsoft-openai-ceos-attend-white-house-ai-meeting-official-2023-05-02/)\] Biden told them ‚ÄúI hope you can educate us as to what you think is most needed to protect society‚Äù. yeah im not so sure about that. They‚Äôre spending $140 million to help build regulation in AI

## Open Source

* StarCoder - The biggest open source code LLM. It‚Äôs a free VS code extension. Looks great for coding, makes you wonder how long things like Github Copilot and Ghostwriter can afford to charge when we have open source building things like this. Link to github \[[Link](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder/tree/main)\] Link to HF \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/bigcode)\]
* MPT-7B is a commercially usable LLM with a context length of 65k! In an example they fed the entire Great Gatsby text in a prompt - 67873 tokens \[[Link](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b)\]
* RedPajama released their 3B & 7B models \[[Link](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama-models-v1)\]

## Microsoft

* Microsoft released Bing Chat to everyone today, no more waitlist. It‚Äôs going to have plugins, have multimodal answers so it can create charts and graphs and can retain past convos. If this gets as good as chatgpt why pay for plus? Will be interesting to see how this plays out \[[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23710071/microsoft-bing-chat-ai-public-preview-plug-in-support)\]

## AMD

* Microsoft & AMD are working together on an AI chip to compete with Nvidia. A week ago a friend asked me what to invest in with AI and I told him AMD lol. I still would if I had money (this is not financial advice, I‚Äôve invested only once before. I am not smart) \[[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/5/23712242/microsoft-amd-ai-processor-chip-nvidia-gpu-athena-mi300)\]

## OpenAI

* OpenAI‚Äôs losses totalled $540 million. They may try to raise as much as $100 Billion in the coming years to get to AGI. This seems kinda insane but if you look at other companies, this is only 4x Uber. The difference in impact OpenAI and Uber have is much more than 4x \[[Link](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt)\]
* OpenAI released a research paper + code for text-to-3D. This very well could mean we‚Äôll be able to go from text to 3D printer, I‚Äôm fairly certain this will be a thing. Just imagine the potential, incredible \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02463)\]

## Layoffs

* IBM plans to pause hiring for 7800 workers and eventually replace them with AI \[[Link](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-threatens-7800-jobs-as-ibm-pauses-hiring/)\]. This is for back-office functions like HR the ceo mentioned. What happens when all big tech go down this route?
* Chegg said ChatGPT might be hindering their growth in an earnings calls and their stock plunged by 50% \[[Link](https://www.ft.com/content/b11a30be-0822-4dec-920a-f611a800830b)\]. Because of this both Pearson & Duoliungo also got hit lol \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/pearson-shares-fall-after-us-rival-says-ai-hurting-its-business?utm_source=nofil.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-calm-before-the-storm)\] \[[Link](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/05/02/why-duolingo-stock-was-sliding-today/?utm_source=nofil.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-calm-before-the-storm)\]

## EU Laws

* LAION, the German non-profit working to democratise AI has urged the EU to not castrate AI research or they risk leaving AI advancements to the US alone with the EU falling far, far behind. Even in the US there‚Äôs only a handful of companies that control most of the AI tech, I hope the EU‚Äôs AI bill isn‚Äôt as bad as its looking \[[Link](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/04/eu-urged-to-protect-grassroots-ai-research-or-risk-losing-out-to-us)\]

## Google

* A leaked document from google says ‚ÄúWe have no moat, and neither does OpenAI‚Äù. A researcher from Google talking about the impact of open source models, basically saying open source will outcompete both in the long run. Could be true, I don‚Äôt agree and think it‚Äôs actually really dumb. Will discuss this further in my newsletters \[[Link](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)\] (Khan Academy has been using OpenAI for their AI tool and lets just say they wont be changing to open source anytime soon - or ever really. There is moat)

## A new ChatGPT Competitor - HeyPi

* Inflection is a company that raised $225 Million and they released their first chatbot. It‚Äôs designed to have more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù convos. You can even use it by texting on different messaging apps. I think something like this will be very big in therapy and just overall being a companion because it seems like they might be going for more of a personal, finetuned model for each individual user. We‚Äôll see ig \[[Link](https://heypi.com/talk?utm_source=inflection.ai)\]

## Education

* Khan Academy‚Äôs AI is the future personalised education. This will be the future of education imo, can‚Äôt wait to write about this in depth in my newsletter \[[Link](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_the_amazing_ai_super_tutor_for_students_and_teachers/c)\]
* This study shows teachers and students are embracing AI with 51% of teachers reporting using it \[[Link](https://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/learning/teachers-and-students-embrace-chatgpt-for-education)\]

## Meta

* Zuck is playing a different game to Google & Microsoft. They‚Äôre much more willing to open source and they will continue to be moving forward \[[Link](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/META-Q1-2023-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf)\] pg 10

## Nvidia

* Nvidia are creating some of the craziest graphics ever, in an online environment. Just look at this video \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/neural_appearance_models/assets/nvidia_neural_materials_video-2023-05.mp4)\]. Link to paper \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/neural_appearance_models/)\]
* Nvidia talk about their latest research on on generating virtual worlds, 3D rendering, and whole bunch of other things. Graphics are going to be insane in the future \[[Link](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/05/02/graphics-research-advances-generative-ai-next-frontier/)\]

## Perplexity

* A competitor to ChatGPT, Perplexity just released their first plugin with Wolfram Alpha. If these competitors can get plugins out there before OpenAI, I think it will be big for them \[[Link](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1654171132243607577?s=20)\]

## Research

* Researchers from Texas were able to use AI to develop a way to translate thoughts into text. The exact words weren‚Äôt the same but the overall meaning is somewhat accurate. tbh the fact that even a few sentences are captured is incredible. Yep, like actual mind reading essentially \[[Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01304-9)\] It was only 2 months ago researchers from Osaka were able to reconstruct what someone was seeing by analysing fMRI data, wild stuff \[[Link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v2.full.pdf)\]
* Cebra - Researchers were able to reconstruct what a mouse is looking at by scanning its brain activity. The details of this are wild, they even genetically engineered mice to make it easier to view the neurons firing \[[Link](https://cebra.ai/)\]
* Learning Physically Simulated Tennis Skills from Broadcast Videos - this research paper talks about how a system can learn tennis shots and movements just by watching real tennis. It can then create a simulation of two tennis players having a rally with realistic racket and ball dynamics. Can‚Äôt wait to see if this is integrated with actual robots and if it actually works irl \[[Link](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/vid2player3d/)\]
* Robots are learning to traverse the outdoors \[[Link](https://www.joannetruong.com/projects/i2o.html)\]
* AI now performs better at Theory Of Mind tests than actual humans \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11490)\]
* There‚Äôs a study going around showing how humans preferred a chatbot over an actual physician when comparing responses for both quality and empathy \[[Link](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2804309)\]. Only problem I have with this is that the data for the doctors was taken from reddit..

100,12a0ajb,chatgpt,GPT-4,relevance,2023-04-02 22:20:14,I gave GPT-4 persistent memory and the ability to self improve,ian-kent,False,0.96,832,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12a0ajb/i_gave_gpt4_persistent_memory_and_the_ability_to/,330,1680474014.0,"It's called GPTChat and I'm sharing it in case anyone wants to try it out or make it better.

The source code (including all of the prompts) is on GitHub:¬†[https://github.com/ian-kent/gptchat](https://github.com/ian-kent/gptchat)

It can:

* remember useful information and recall it later
* recall information without knowing it's previously remembered it
* write it's own plugins and call them
* decide to write plugins without being prompted
* complete tasks by combining memories and plugins
* use multi-step commands to complete complex tasks

You can watch some demos of it in action on YouTube:

* [Persistent memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUFZdM1nSTI)
* [GPT writing it's own plugins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7M-XH6tMhc)

Those videos only show the conversation, but it has a debug mode where you can see everything else that's happening underneath.

GPT seems to write one-shot plugins with around 90% accuracy - the other 10% it either gets on the second attempt or eventually gives up trying.

The memory module also uses GPT-4 to implement memory recall, allowing it to find memories related to concepts without knowing specifically what memories it already has.

I'd recommend supervising it - after many experiments where it was happy building simple plugins to solve specific tasks, in one experiment it decided it'd be better to create a generic HTTP plugin so it could call any APIs without writing more plugins. That was unnerving, and quickly deleted.

I'd love to get some feedback or suggestions for improvements (and PRs are welcome!).

I'm currently working on improving the memory module - because it uses GPT-4 for recall, the total memory storage is limited by the context window, but I have some ideas on how I can get around this limitation.

Disclaimer - one apparently simple conversation can make a lot of API calls with a lot of prompts and responses, so keep an eye on your API usage costs!"

Last night this thing was able to find patterns/correlations and solve formulas I‚Äôve been trying to solve for Y E A R S! Literally almost a decade of work were done in just a couple minutes.

For the first time in my life I got to feel a bit ‚Äúweird‚Äù and in ‚Äúawe‚Äù about a tech product. Not because I‚Äôm afraid of it taking my job (I will always find something else), instead because of the immense deductive reasoning and pattern recognition power of it. Obviously this is gonna keep growing exponentially every minute, but just this initial update would have enough power to find and replicate patterns that could disrupt ANYTHING in a matter of seconds.

I‚Äôve been working with ML for many years, but that‚Äôs the first time I felt a product being close to  what we call ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù.
Just to be clear, I only felt that when getting it to deal with complex problems for at least 12 hours straight. If you ask it for things such as ‚Äúwrite a poem‚Äù or do not maintain a conversation inside a scope, you likely won‚Äôt notice it.

I‚Äôve begun to question the claim about 12 pages worth of token memory with GPT-4 as it now not only seems to have more frequent issues remembering prompts in their entirety past around 5-6 pages of tokens, but also disregards certain parts of a prompt that I even emphasize in its responses. Was wondering if anyone else was experiencing this too?

EDIT: Did not expect this big of a response so let me help address some of the most frequent responses I‚Äôve seen in here.

-I don‚Äôt care that this has apparently been asked before. Not everyone is on Reddit all the time. If you‚Äôre on here so much that you constantly see this question I would recommend closing Reddit and going outside for a few hours as well as removing the stick from your ass.

-People are asking this question probably because they‚Äôve been utilizing GPT-4 from their *paid* GPT Plus subscription since it‚Äôs release and therefore it wouldn‚Äôt be far-fetched that someone utilizing a tool on a daily basis would notice if it starts to become dull, especially if they keep using that tool for the same jobs. I have a feeling most of the people saying ‚Äúno the hype has just worn off/the honeymoon period has ended‚Äù literally don‚Äôt even have GPT-4, much less have had it since it‚Äôs release.

-Nobody wants to comb through hundreds of old chat histories and draw up a screenshot comparing it to a similar recent conversation in a way that‚Äôs irrefutable just to prove a point to you. See above."

* Some pretty famous people (Musk, Wozniak + others) have signed a letter (?) to pause the work done on AI systems more powerful than gpt4. Very curious to hear what people think about this.

The goal of this project was to have GPT-4 generate an entire novel from scratch, including the title, genre, story, characters, settings, and all the writing, with no human input. It is impossible currently to do this using a single prompt, but what is possible is to supply a series of prompts that give structure to the process and allow it to complete this large task, one step at a time. However, in order to ensure that all the creative work is done by GPT-4, prompts are not allowed to make specific references to the *content* of the book, only the book‚Äôs *structure*. The intention is that the process should be simple, mechanical and possible (in principle) to fully automate. Each time the process is repeated from the beginning, it should create another entirely new book, based solely on GPT-4‚Äôs independent creative choices.

The result: ***Echoes of Atlantis***, a fantasy adventure novel with 12 chapters and 115 pages, written over 10 days, from the day GPT-4 was released until now.

# Insights/Techniques

My main insights I figured out in the course of doing this project:

* **Iterative refinement:** Start with a high level outline. Make a detailed chapter outline. Then write a draft version of the full chapter (this will be much shorter than desired). Then expand each scene into a longer, more detailed scene.
* **Bounding (outside-in):** GPT-4 loves to go too far ahead, writing about parts of the book that aren‚Äôt supposed to happen yet. The key to preventing this is to have it first write the **first parts**, then the **last parts**, then fill in the **middle parts**. The last part prevents it from going too far ahead, and the first parts in turn bound the last part of the previous section. Bounding is used at every level of refinement except the top level.
* **Single prompt:** Often, by using a single large prompt, rather than a running conversation, you can flexibly determine exactly what information will be included in the input buffer, and ensure that all of it is relevant to the current task. I‚Äôve crafted this approach to squeeze as much relevant info as I can into the token buffer.
* **Continuity notes:** Ask it to take notes on important details to remember for continuity and consistency as it goes. Begin with continuity notes summarized from the previous scene, and then fold in additional continuity notes from the previous continuity notes. Continuity Notes will tend to grow over time; if they become too long, ask it to summarize them.
* **Revising outlines:** In some cases, the AI improvises in its writing, for example moving some of the Chapter 5 scenes into Chapter 4, which breaks the book. To resolve this, I ask it after each chapter to go back and update its earlier, higher-level outlines and regenerate the opening and closing scenes of each chapter before continuing. This is very similar to how real authors revise their outlines over time.
* **Data cleanup:** Sometimes outputs will do things a little weird, like copy labels from the input buffer like ‚ÄúOpening Paragraph‚Äù, or forget to number the scenes, or start numbering at zero, or add a little bit of stray text at the beginning. Currently I clean these up manually but a fully automated solution would have to cope with these.

# Example prompts

These are just a few examples. For full details, see my [Research Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/108oqbYW4BPc0hfHQDyXpk8RlsNmXJaJzi2U6G1tRLTg/edit#).

**Level 1: Top-level outline**

**Me:** Please write a high-level outline for a book. Include a list of characters and a short description of each character. Include a list of chapters and a short summary of what happens in each chapter. You can pick any title and genre you want.

**Level 1: Updating outline after each chapter**

**Me:** Please edit and update the high-level outline for the book below, taking into account what has already happened in Chapter 1.

**Level 2: Scenes (bounding)**

**Me:** Please write a detailed outline describing the first scene of each chapter. It should describe what happens in that opening scene and set up the story for the rest of the chapter. Do not summarize the entire chapter, only the first scene.

**Me:** Write a detailed outline describing the final, last scene of each chapter. It should describe what happens at the very end of the chapter, and set up the story for the opening scene of the next chapter, which will come immediately afterwards.

**Level 2: Scenes**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following opening and final scenes for Chapter 1, write a detailed chapter outline giving all the scenes in the chapter and a short description of each. Begin the outline with the Opening Scene below, and finish the outline with the Final Scene below.

**Level 3: Rough draft**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and following detailed chapter outline for Chapter 1, write a first draft of Chapter 1. Label each of the scenes. Stop when you reach the end of Chapter 1. It should set up the story for Chapter 2, which will come immediately afterwards. It should be written in a narrative style and should be long, detailed, and engaging.

**Level 4: Paragraphs (bounding)**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following draft of Chapter 1, imagine that you have expanded this draft into a longer, more detailed chapter. For each scene, give me both the first opening paragraph, and the last, final paragraph of that longer, more detailed version. Label them as Opening Paragraph and Final Paragraph. The opening paragraph should introduce the scene. The final paragraph should set up the story for the following scene, which will come immediately afterwards. The last paragraph of the final scene should set the story up for the following chapter, which will come immediately afterwards.

**Level 4: Paragraphs**

**Me:** Given the following book outline, and the following draft of Chapter 1, write a longer, more detailed version of Scene 1. The scene must begin and end with the following paragraphs: (opening and closing paragraphs here)

**Continuity Notes**

**Me:** Please briefly note any important details or facts from the scene below that you will need to remember while writing the rest of the book, in order to ensure continuity and consistency. Label these Continuity Notes.

**Me:** Combine and summarize these notes with the existing previous Continuity Notes below.

# Reflections on the result

Although in many ways the work did come together as a coherent work of fiction, following its own outline and proceeding at the pacing that its own outline dictated, and some parts were genuinely exciting and interesting to read (particularly the earliest and latest chapters), I‚Äôd hesitate to call it a good book. It‚Äôs still got some weird and interesting problems to it:

* **Reference without introduction:** Occasionally, the AI will reference things that have not really been introduced/explained yet, like Langdon knowing about Lord Malakhar in Chapter 4, or Aria having a physical pendant after her dream of Queen Neria. It feels like you must have missed something.
* **Seams around opening/closing paragraphs:** Because opening and final paragraphs are written before the rest of the scene, sometimes they don‚Äôt flow smoothly from the rest, or they even end up redundant. An additional pass of some kind could help clean this up. Likewise, sometimes the transition between chapters could seem abrupt, like going from Chapter 8 to 9 (fighting Malakhar in the labyrinth to just suddenly a passage to Atlantis opening).
* **Forgetting certain details:** Although certain details are maintained in the Continuity Notes or in the outline, others it decides to drop, and then they can never be referenced again, since they are no longer in the input buffer. A good example of this is the compass Aria got as a graduation present, which felt a lot like a Chekov‚Äôs gun that was never mentioned again. Another is the particular unique weapons they purchased at the outset, which were never used. The only clear solution is either a larger buffer or a long-term memory solution.
* **Rearrangements:** The AI moved some parts from later chapters into earlier chapters, despite my best attempts to bound it, such as the early scenes on the island which moved from Chapter 5 to Chapter 4, and the early labyrinth scenes which were moved from Chapter 6 to Chapter 5. The only real way to address this was to ask it to edit and update its high-level outlines afterwards. This is similar to what human authors do ‚Äî they rarely treat their outlines as static and inviolable.
* **Pacing:** To me, the labyrinth chapters felt like a bit of a slog. It was one trap chamber after another, for a very long time. These did fit the original outline, so the original outline was part of the problem, but there are also ways it could have made the labyrinth feel new and different. This feels like a creative writing mistake by GPT-4 to me.
* **Overly regular structure:** Almost invariably the AI chose to write 6‚Äì8 scenes per chapter, and about 1‚Äì2 pages per scene. This feels less organic than a lot of human-written works where some scenes/chapters are short and others are longer. It might have been better to develop a dynamic expansion structure where it continues to expand until it is somehow satisfied that it has achieved the desired level of detail.
* **Varying level of detail:** On a related note, some scenes were quite detailed, including dialog and minute actions, while others (even more important scenes) seemed to breeze right over big important moments with a summary. Again, I think some kind of dynamic expansion to achieve a consistent level of detail could help here.

# Some fun notes

* In Scene 3 of Chapter 5, GPT-4 spontaneously wrote an original riddle in the labyrinth that they had to solve: ‚ÄúWithin my walls I hold a sea, / Yet not a drop of water you‚Äôll see. / Many paths there are to roam, / But only one will lead you home. / What am I?‚Äù Alex figured it out, the answer is ‚Äúa map‚Äù.
* In at least three places, GPT-4 slipped in sly references to ‚Äúthe next chapter in her life‚Äù or ‚Äúthe next chapter in their adventure‚Äù right as the chapter was ending. Very meta.

# Frequently asked questions

**Q: Didn‚Äôt you exhibit a lot of authorial control in choosing which answers to keep and which ones to throw away?**

Actually, regenerating responses was rare, and I only ever did it if I either found a serious problem with the process or if there was a serious logical problem in the book that I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to resolve with process changes. This happened at most 4‚Äì5 times in all. At least 95% of the time, the text in the book is the very first response I got back from GPT-4. You can see this in the notes in my research log.

**Q: This book isn‚Äôt very good. I don‚Äôt think professional authors will have very much to worry about.**

True, but that‚Äôs not the point. It‚Äôs a proof of concept: can an AI write an entire book, of 100+ pages, from beginning to end, while remaining coherent and following its original planned outline? Without needing humans to step in and tell it what to do with the story or the characters? The answer is yes. Moreover, I think it‚Äôs pretty enjoyable in some parts. And of course, the next GPT model will only be a better author.

**Q: Isn‚Äôt there a rate limit on GPT-4 queries on ChatGPT Plus? How could you have written 100+ pages in 10 days?**

Yes, and I hit it many times. However, because both my prompts and ChatGPT‚Äôs responses were very long, I was able to squeeze the absolute maximum text out of every prompt. Moreover, GPT-4 accepts a much longer prompt input than either GPT-3 or Bing did, which helps a ton for ensuring I can include as much context as possible. Also, the limit was higher in early days right after GPT-4 release.

**Q: Is GPT-4 needed for this? How does it compare to GPT-3?**

I tried this with GPT-3 before and encountered issues, mostly around writing too far ahead in the story and getting off-track. Bounding techniques might help, I haven't tried yet - partly because it's a pain to deal with the smaller input buffer. Needs further investigation.

**Q: Can I use your book or your process or your prompts?**

Please feel free, I did this for fun in my free time and I release all of this into the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero Waiver ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)) and disclaim any IP rights.

These are unprecedented times

Link to newsletter at the bottom + call for help in the comments (want to partner with someone to make video content about AI)

Enjoy

# AI x Military

* Palantir announced their AI platform for military use. There‚Äôs too much to even put here but it‚Äôs legit terrifying. The AI can assess a situation and come up with action plans by accessing info from satellites, drones and other data sources within the org. Getting serious MGS vibes reading this \[[Link](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/aip/)\]. I‚Äôll be talking about this in depth in my newsletter. Link to youtube video \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEM5qz__HOU&t=1s)\]

# AI Safety

* Dr Paul Christiano was a researcher at OpenAI on their safety team from 2017-2021 and helped create the RLHF technique (RLHF is the reason ChatGPT sounds so human). He did an interview on AI alignment and its fascinating, well worth a watch. Quote from the very beginning of the video ‚ÄúThe most likely way we die involves not AI comes out of the blue and kills everyone, but involves we have deployed a lot of AI everywhere.. and if for some reason all the AI systems would try and kill us, they would definitely kill us‚Äù. Another quote for the heck of it ‚Äú10-20% chance AI takeover and most humans die‚Ä¶ 50% chance of doom once AI systems are human-level intelligent‚Äù. Will explore this more in upcoming newsletters coz its crazy. Link to interview \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyFkWb903aU)\]

&#x200B;

# Boston Dynamics + ChatGPT

* Boston Dynamics put ChatGPT in a robot. Atm it can do things like identify changes in the environment, read gauges, detect thermal anomalies \[[Link](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1650832349008125952)\]. Not sure I‚Äôm looking forward to this one lol

# Music

* Grimes is the first artist to offer splitting royalties with AI generated songs \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1650304051718791170)\]. Shes working on a program that can simulate her voice \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1650325296850018306)\]. Think its inevitable musicians do something similar to ‚Äúown‚Äù their voices and have some control of how they‚Äôre used
* AI model analyses music and creates realistic dances that actual dancers can perform. Scroll down and take a look at the moves, very curious to hear what actual dancers think of this \[[Link](https://edge-dance.github.io/)\]
* People are already making sites to create AI music \[[Link](https://create.musicfy.lol/)\]. One site already got taken down by UMG lol \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gd3kr/status/1651590854312861698?s=20)\]
* A website to find AI hits \[[Link](https://aihits.co/)\]

&#x200B;

# Open Source

Hugging Face is a website that hosts models for AI & ML and allows for open source contributions. The website hosts a tonne of models.

* Hugging Face released an open source chat model called Hugging Chat \[[Link](https://huggingface.co/chat/)\]. It‚Äôs very possible we see HuggingChat Apps - apps that use a number of models across Hugging Face. Very well could become the Android App store of AI
* Gradio tools is an open source library that lets you combine an LLM agent with any gradio app, and it integrates with Langchain. Honestly I can see so many use cases with something like this, just not enough time to build üò¢ \[[Link](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-tools)\]
* GPT4Tools lets you generate images, edit them, and do normal text stuff, make code - everything in one place. Its based on Meta‚Äôs LLaMA \[[Link](https://gpt4tools.github.io/)\]
* Databerry lets you build agents trained on your own data. Link to website \[[Link](https://www.databerry.ai/)\]. Link to Github \[[Link](https://github.com/gmpetrov/databerry)\]
* Chatbot Arena - Someone made a way to compare and vote on which open source LM is the best \[[Link](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena)\]
* gpt4free is an open source repo that lets you use gpt3&4 ***without*** an API key \[[Link](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free)\]. Its blown up on github for a reason
* Someone fine tuned an LLM on all their iMessages and open sourced it \[[Link](https://github.com/1rgs/MeGPT)\]

&#x200B;

# OpenAI

* You can now disable chat history and training in ChatGPT, meaning you don‚Äôt have to worry about sensitive info being leaked. ChatGPT Business is also coming in a few months \[[Link](https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt)\]
* OpenAI released a new branding guideline. Lots of new products are going to have to change their names \[[Link](https://openai.com/brand)\]
* You can make asynchronous calls to openai api now. 100+ in a few seconds \[[Link](https://twitter.com/gneubig/status/1649413966995619845)\]

&#x200B;

# Politics & Media

* The RNC (Republican National Committee) made a 100% AI generated Ad shitting Biden. The video basically shows a post apocaluytpic looking US. This is just the beginning. AI content is going to spread misinformation and fear mongering like crazy when the US elections come around \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLMMxgtxQ1Y)\]
* A news reporter interviewed his AI self live and was absolutely stunned. tbf the AI voice cloning was impeccable, done using forever voices \[[Link](https://twitter.com/martinmco/status/1649638460712468481)\]

&#x200B;

# Looming Regulation

* Four federal agencies released a joint statement on AI and regulating the industry. Some things in the statement suggest they have absolutely no idea what they‚Äôre talking about so it‚Äôs looking great so far. Link to pdf statement \[[Link](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EEOC-CRT-FTC-CFPB-AI-Joint-Statement%28final%29.pdf)\]

&#x200B;

# Replit

Replit is a software company that lets you code in your browser. They do a tonne of stuff and have been at the forfront of coding x AI. What they‚Äôve been doing is crazy and they have a team of just 85

* They announced their own code LLM. I won‚Äôt bore you with the details but its looking good + it will be open source and freely licensed meaning it can be used commercially \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1651344182425051136?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)\]
* They also announced they‚Äôve turned their IDE into a set of tools for an autonomous agent. What does this mean? Tell it to build something and watch it try and build an entire app in Replit. The future of coding folks

&#x200B;

# Research Papers

* Probably the craziest paper from the last few weeks. Researchers may have found a way to allow models to retain info up to 2 million tokens. To put into perspective just how much info that is, currently GPT-4‚Äôs biggest option is 32k tokens which is \~50 pages of documents. The entire Harry Potter series is \~1.5M tokens. Models could retain years of info, analyse gigantic amounts of data. I can imagine this will be very big for things like AI customer service, therapists etc. Will explore this further in upcoming newsletters. Link to paper \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11062)}
* Record a video and then see the video from any different perspective. In the example they record a video of a person playing with their dog and then construct video from the dogs point of view \[[Link](https://andrewsonga.github.io/totalrecon/)\]
* A way for robots to create a full map and 3d scene of your home without a lot of training data \[[Link](https://pierremarza.github.io/projects/autonerf/)\]
* Researchers were able to generate images with stable diffusion on a mobile device in under 12 seconds \[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11267)\]
* Research shows the intro of LLMs with customer support workers led to a large increase in productivity, improved customer retention and even employee retention \[[Link](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161)\]

&#x200B;

# Money

* PWC invests $1 billion to use AI like Azure OpenAI services \[[Link](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-us-makes-billion-investment-in-ai-capabilities.html)\]
* Replit raised a $97.4M Series B valuing the company at over a billion. A new unicorn emerges \[[Link](https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1650900629521596421)\]
* Harvey the AI law startup raised a 21M Series A. Honestly surprised its not bigger \[[Link](https://www.harvey.ai/blog)\]

&#x200B;

# Prompting

* Andrew Ng (co founder of Google Brain) released a course on ChatGPT prompt engineering for developers. It says it‚Äôs a beginner friendly course and only basic knowledge of python is needed \[[Link](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)\]
* Microsoft released a prompt engineering technique guide \[[Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/advanced-prompt-engineering?pivots=programming-language-chat-completions#specifying-the-output-structure)\]

&#x200B;

# Games

* Someone modded ChatGPT in Skyrim VR and man, AI in games is gona be so cool. NPC‚Äôs know the time of day and they can see what items you have \[[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz6mAX41fs0)\]
* Someone is launching a Rust server where AI will control all the NPCs. It will remember who does what and it will have plans to achieve. Very interesting to see how this goes. Link to video announcement \[[Link](https://twitter.com/the_carlosdp/status/1649937143253352449)\]. Link to website \[[Link](https://www.whisperingfable.com/)\]

# Text-to-Video

If you‚Äôre sceptical of the speed of progress, check out this tweet showing the difference between Midjourney v1 and v5. Not even a year apart and its like comparing a toddlers drawing to an artist \[[Link](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1650822516972060675)\] Will the same happen with video? We might be seeing it happen right now

112,1375dlt,chatgpt,GPT-4,relevance,2023-05-04 01:05:53,"GPT-4 Prompt: ""Rewrite The Night Before Christmas except it's about stoners and weed."" Result: The greatest thing I've ever read in my entire life.",r2bl3nd,False,0.94,2418,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1375dlt/gpt4_prompt_rewrite_the_night_before_christmas/,334,1683162353.0,"'Twas the night before 4/20, and all through the pad,  
Not a creature was stirring, not even a cat.  
The bongs were all placed by the windows with care,  
In hopes that St. Ganja soon would be there.  


The stoners were nestled all snug in their beds,  
While visions of munchies danced in their heads.  
With my hemp cap on, and my stoner babe near,  
We had just settled down for a night without fear.  


When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,  
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.  
Away to the window I flew like a flash,  
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.  


The moon on the breast of the new-fallen weed,  
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects indeed.  
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,  
But a miniature van, and eight tiny reindeer.  


With a little old driver, so lively and quick,  
I knew in a moment it must be St. Ganja, no trick.  
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,  
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!  


""Now, Blunt! Now, Bubbler! Now, Vape Pen and Zigzag!  
On, Kush! On, Haze! On, Skunk and Big Bag!  
To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!  
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""  


As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,  
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.  
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew,  
With the van full of weed, and St. Ganja too.  


And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof,  
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,  
Down the chimney St. Ganja came with a bound.  


He was dressed all in hemp, from his head to his foot,  
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.  
A bundle of weed he had flung on his back,  
And he looked like a peddler just opening his sack.  


His eyes‚Äîhow they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!  
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!  
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,  
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.  


The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,  
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.  
He had a broad face and a round little belly,  
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly!  


He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,  
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.  
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,  
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.  


He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  
And filled all the bongs, then turned with a jerk.  
And laying his finger aside of his nose,  
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!  


He sprang to his van, to his team gave a whistle,  
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.  
But I heard him exclaim, as he drove out of sight,  
""Happy 4/20 to all, and to all a good night!"""
