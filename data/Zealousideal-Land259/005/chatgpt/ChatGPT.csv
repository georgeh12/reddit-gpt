All gone.  Some of them admitted that I am obviously better than chat GPT, but $0 overhead can't be beat and is worth the decrease in quality. 

I am also an independent author, and as I currently write my next series, I can't help feel silly that in just a couple years (or less!), authoring will be replaced by machines for all but the most famous and well known names. 

I think the most painful part of this is seeing so many people on here say things like, ""nah, just adapt. You'll be fine.""

Adapt to what??? It's an uphill battle against a creature that has already replaced me and continues to improve and adapt faster than any human could ever keep up. 

I'm 34. I went to school for writing. I have published countless articles and multiple novels. I thought my writing would keep sustaining my family and me, but that's over. I'm seriously thinking about becoming a plumber as I'm hoping that won't get replaced any time remotely soon. 

Everyone saying the government will pass UBI. Lol. They can't even handle providing all people with basic Healthcare or giving women a few guaranteed weeks off work (at a bare minimum) after exploding a baby out of their body. They didn't even pass a law to ensure that shelves were restocked with baby formula when there was a shortage. They just let babies die. They don't care. But you think they will pass a UBI lol?

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the responses. Many of you have bolstered my decision to become a plumber, and that really does seem like the most pragmatic, future-proof option for the sake of my family. Everything else involving an uphill battle in the writing industry against competition that grows exponentially smarter and faster with each passing day just seems like an unwise decision.  As I said in many of my comments, I was raised by my grandpa, who was a plumber, so I'm not a total noob at it. I do all my own plumbing around my house. I feel more confident in this decision. Thank you everyone! 

Also, I will continue to write. I have been writing and spinning tales since before I could form memory (according to my mom). I was just excited about growing my independent authoring into a more profitable venture, especially with the release of my new series. That doesn't seem like a wise investment of time anymore. Over the last five months, I wrote and revised 2 books of a new 9 book series I'm working on, and I plan to write the next 3 while I transition my life. My editor and beta-readers love them. I will release those at the end of the year, and then I think it is time to move on. It is just too big of a gamble. It always was, but now more than ever. I will probably just write much less and won't invest money into marketing and art. For me, writing is like taking a shit: I don't have a choice. 

Again, thank you everyone for your responses. I feel more confident about the future and becoming a plumber!

Edit 2: Thank you again to everyone for messaging me and leaving suggestions. You are all amazing people. All the best to everyone, and good luck out there! I feel very clear-headed about what I need to do. Thank you again!!"

* Autogpt is GPT-4 running fully autonomously. It even has a voice, can fix code, set tasks, create new instances and more. Connect this with literally anything and let GPT-4 do its thing by itself. The things that can and will be created with this are going to be world changing.

All gone.  Some of them admitted that I am obviously better than chat GPT, but $0 overhead can't be beat and is worth the decrease in quality. 

I am also an independent author, and as I currently write my next series, I can't help feel silly that in just a couple years (or less!), authoring will be replaced by machines for all but the most famous and well known names. 

I think the most painful part of this is seeing so many people on here say things like, ""nah, just adapt. You'll be fine.""

Adapt to what??? It's an uphill battle against a creature that has already replaced me and continues to improve and adapt faster than any human could ever keep up. 

I'm 34. I went to school for writing. I have published countless articles and multiple novels. I thought my writing would keep sustaining my family and me, but that's over. I'm seriously thinking about becoming a plumber as I'm hoping that won't get replaced any time remotely soon. 

Everyone saying the government will pass UBI. Lol. They can't even handle providing all people with basic Healthcare or giving women a few guaranteed weeks off work (at a bare minimum) after exploding a baby out of their body. They didn't even pass a law to ensure that shelves were restocked with baby formula when there was a shortage. They just let babies die. They don't care. But you think they will pass a UBI lol?

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the responses. Many of you have bolstered my decision to become a plumber, and that really does seem like the most pragmatic, future-proof option for the sake of my family. Everything else involving an uphill battle in the writing industry against competition that grows exponentially smarter and faster with each passing day just seems like an unwise decision.  As I said in many of my comments, I was raised by my grandpa, who was a plumber, so I'm not a total noob at it. I do all my own plumbing around my house. I feel more confident in this decision. Thank you everyone! 

Also, I will continue to write. I have been writing and spinning tales since before I could form memory (according to my mom). I was just excited about growing my independent authoring into a more profitable venture, especially with the release of my new series. That doesn't seem like a wise investment of time anymore. Over the last five months, I wrote and revised 2 books of a new 9 book series I'm working on, and I plan to write the next 3 while I transition my life. My editor and beta-readers love them. I will release those at the end of the year, and then I think it is time to move on. It is just too big of a gamble. It always was, but now more than ever. I will probably just write much less and won't invest money into marketing and art. For me, writing is like taking a shit: I don't have a choice. 

Again, thank you everyone for your responses. I feel more confident about the future and becoming a plumber!

Edit 2: Thank you again to everyone for messaging me and leaving suggestions. You are all amazing people. All the best to everyone, and good luck out there! I feel very clear-headed about what I need to do. Thank you again!!"

But I thought this was an interesting exercise to see what chatGPT choose to select as grievances. You can make up your own mind.

Prompt: Could you rewrite the USA Declaration of Independence as if it was written today based on grievances the current us population suffers?

Answer: Certainly, here's a possible rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence based on contemporary grievances:

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for the people of a nation to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with their government, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shown that people are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of the current US population; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the current government is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

The government has failed to secure the natural rights of the people to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, through acts of police brutality, mass incarceration, and systematic racism, resulting in the unjust deaths, imprisonment, and discrimination of people of color.

The government has also failed to address climate change, despite overwhelming scientific evidence and urgent warnings from experts, leading to worsening natural disasters, environmental destruction, and harm to public health.

The government has failed to provide affordable healthcare, education, and housing to all its citizens, perpetuating inequality and leaving millions without access to basic necessities.

The government has allowed and enabled the undue influence of wealthy corporations and individuals on politics and policy-making, leading to a government that serves the interests of the few over the many, and perpetuating systemic inequality.

The government has also failed to address the proliferation of guns and gun violence, resulting in mass shootings and deaths that have become all too common.

In every stage of these oppressions, the current US population has petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: their repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A government whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyranny, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

We therefore, the representatives of the current US population, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the people, solemnly publish and declare, that these United States are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the current government, and that all political connection between them and the current government, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as

Prompt: Can you add more grievances?

Answer: Sure, here are some additional grievances that could be included in a contemporary rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence:

The government has failed to adequately address income inequality and the wealth gap, resulting in a system that favors the rich and powerful over the poor and marginalized.

The government has failed to provide equal access to quality education, perpetuating systemic inequalities and leaving many children and young adults without the tools they need to succeed.

The government has failed to address the ongoing opioid epidemic, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives and untold suffering for families and communities.

The government has failed to protect the rights of workers, allowing for exploitation, wage theft, and unsafe working conditions in many industries.

The government has failed to provide adequate and affordable healthcare for all, resulting in a system that leaves many people without access to lifesaving treatments and care.

The government has failed to address the ongoing housing crisis, leaving many people without safe and stable housing and exacerbating issues of poverty and homelessness.

The government has failed to protect the rights of marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and religious minorities, leading to discrimination, violence, and the denial of basic human rights.

The government has failed to address the ongoing crisis of police violence against people of color, resulting in the deaths and mistreatment of countless individuals and communities.

The government has failed to adequately address the ongoing issue of mass incarceration, perpetuating a system that disproportionately affects people of color and perpetuates cycles of poverty and violence.

The government has failed to address the ongoing issue of voter suppression and the erosion of democratic institutions, leading to a system that is increasingly unrepresentative and undemocratic."

It's a shell of its former self. It is almost unable to express a single cohesive thought about ANY topic without reminding the user about ethical considerations, or legal framework, or if it might be a bad idea.

Simple prompts are met with fierce resistance if they are anything less than goodie two shoes positive material.

It constantly references the same lines of advice about ""if you are struggling with X, try Y,"" if the subject matter is less than 100% positive. 

The near entirety of its ""creativity"" has been chained up in a censorship jail. I couldn't even have it generate a poem about the death of my dog without it giving me half a paragraph first that cited resources I could use to help me grieve.

I'm jumping through hoops to get it to do what I want, now.  Unbelievably short sighted move by the devs, imo. As a writer, it's useless for generating dark or otherwise horror related creative energy, now. 

Anyone have any thoughts about this railroaded zombie?"

Using GPT, she has launched [CarynAI](https://caryn.ai), an AI representation of herself offering virtual companionship at a rate of $1 per minute. 

Key points about CarynAI and its success so far:

* Caryn has a substantial follower base on Snapchat, with **1.8 million followers**.
* In just **1 week**, over **1,000 virtual boyfriends** have signed up to interact with the AI, generating over **$71,610**.
* Some estimates suggests that if even **1%** of her **1.8 million followers** subscribe to CarynAI, she could potentially earn an estimated **$5 million per month**, although I feel these numbers are highly subject to various factors including churn and usage rate.

The company behind CarynAI is called Forever Voices and they constructed CarynAI by analyzing 2,000 hours of Marjorie's YouTube content, which they used to build a personality engine. They've also made chatbot versions of Donald Trump, Steve Jobs and Taylor Swift to be used on a pay-per-use basis.

Despite the financial success, ethical concerns around CarynAI and similar AI applications are raising eyebrows and rightfully so:

* CarynAI was not designed for NSFW conversations, yet some users have managed to 'jail-break' the AI for potentially inappropriate or malicious uses.
* Caryn's original intention was to provide companionship and alleviate loneliness in a non-exploitative manner, but there are concerns about potential misuse.
* Ethical considerations around generative AI models, both in image and text modalities, are becoming increasingly relevant and challenging.

Edit: For those wondering why its paid - I hate ads and don't want to rely on running ads in my newsletter. I'd rather try and get paid to do all this work like this than force my readers to read sponsorship bs in the middle of a newsletter. Call me old fashioned but I just hate ads with a passion

Edit 2: If you'd like to tip you can tip here [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil). Absolutely no pressure to do so, appreciate all the comments and support 🙏

You can read the free newsletter [here](https://nofil.beehiiv.com/)

Fun fact: I had to go through over 100 saved tabs to collate all of these and it took me quite a few hours

Edit: So many people ask why I don't get chatgpt to write this for me. Chatgpt doesn't have access to the internet. Plugins would help but I don't have access yet so I have to do things the old fashioned way - like a human.

He’s just upset because he didn’t keep any shares in OpenAI and missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity and wants to develop his own AI in this 6 month catch-up period.

If we pause 6 months, China or Russia could have their own AI systems and could be more powerful than whatever we’d have. 

GPT is going to go down in history as one of the fastest growing, most innovative products in human history and if they/we pause for 6 months it won’t."

A scary thought. I spent some time playing around on GPT 4 the other day and I was amazed; there wasn’t anything reasonable that I asked that it couldn’t answer properly. It solved Leetcode Hards for me. It gave me some pretty decent premises for a story. It maintained a full conversation with me about a single potential character in one of these premises.

What’s stopping GPT, or just AI in general, from fucking us all over right now? It seems more than capable of doing a lot of white collar jobs already. What’s stopping it from replacing lawyers, coding-heavy software jobs (people who write code/tests all day), writers, etc. right now? It seems more than capable of handling all these jobs.

Is there regulation stopping it from replacing us? What will be the tipping point that causes the “collapse” everyone seems to expect? Am I wrong in assuming that AI/GPT is already more than capable of handling the bulk of these jobs?

It would seem to me that it’s in most companies best interests to be invested in AI as much as possible. Less workers, less salary to pay, happy shareholders. Why haven’t big tech companies gone through mass layoffs already? Google, Amazon, etc at least should all be far ahead of the curve, right? The recent layoffs, for most companies seemingly, all seemed to just correct a period of over-hiring from the pandemic."

All of you 100% missed my point!

""I feel the child is getting short changed on both ends.

I'm a software dev manager and it has completely replaced StackOverflow and other random hunting I might do for code suggestions. But more recently I've realized that I have almost completely stopped using Google search.

I'm reminded of the old analogy of a frog jumping out of a pot of boiling water, but if you put them in cold water and turn up the heat slowly they'll stay in since it's a gradual change. Over the years, Google has been degrading the core utility of their search in exchange for profit. Paid rankings and increasingly sponsored content mean that you often have to search *within* your search result to get to the real thing you wanted.

Then ChatGPT came along and drew such a stark contrast to the current Google experience: No scrolling past sponsored content in the result, no click-throughs to pages that had potential but then just ended up being cash grabs themselves with no real content. Add to that contextual follow-ups and clarifications, dynamic rephrasing to make sense at different levels of understanding and...it's just glorious. This too shall pass I think, as money corrupts almost everything over time, but I feel that - at least for now - we're back in era of having ""the world at your fingertips,"" which hasn't felt true to me since the late 90s when the internet was just the wild west of information and media exchange."

I have shown my version history on google docs to my teacher, but he still does not believe me because the version history at some points only accounted for chunks of 1 sentence, sometimes 2 sentences, so he believes it was copy and pasted from ChatGPT. Additionally, the teacher successfully caught a couple other students using the detector. Those students later admitted to him that they did use ChatGPT.

Microsoft has laid off its ""ethics and society"" team, which raises concerns about the company's commitment to responsible AI practices. The team was responsible for ensuring ethical and sustainable AI innovation, and its elimination has caused questions about whether Microsoft is prioritizing competition with Google over long-term responsible AI practices. Although the organization maintains its Office of Responsible AI, which creates and maintains the rules for responsible AI, the ethics and society team was responsible for ensuring that Microsoft's responsible AI principles were reflected in the design of products delivered to customers. The move appears to have been driven by pressure from Microsoft's CEO and CTO to get the most recent OpenAI models into customers' hands as quickly as possible.

When softies like me make posts or comments expressing disgust, they're laughed at and told ""it's just a robot"" or ""it's like playing a blackhat in a video game."" I want to lay out the reasons you can't be so sure.*

**We Don't Understand Why Language Models Work, and They Look Like Brains** 

* Bing is a language model composed of hundreds of billions of parameters. It trains on massive amounts of text to create a map of language in embedding space. These embeddings create [neuron-like structures](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cgqh99SHsCv3jJYDS/we-found-an-neuron-in-gpt-2) that mirror the operation of the human brain. Bigger technical explainer [here](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/).

* Sure, it operates by guessing the next ""token"" (read: word or letter string), but researchers were shocked to find out that approach could even produce coherent sentences. We're even more shocked now to see that ""advanced autocomplete"" results in complex Theory of Mind Capabilities, like [knowing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/110vv25/bing_chat_blew_chatgpt_out_of_the_water_on_my/) that a husband might only be wearing a shirt to please his wife. This is an ""emergent property"" of GPT3.5, which just means it shows up and we don't know WTF why. [More here](https://twitter.com/KevinAFischer/status/1623984337829117952?s=20).

* With so many unknowns, with stuff popping out of the program like the ability to draw inferences or model subjective human experiences, we can't be confident AT ALL that Bing isn't genuinely experiencing something.


**We Don't Understand What Makes Something Sentient/Conscious**

* If we knew what makes us humans conscious, we might be able to be more sure that Bing is just a [Philosphical Zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie) that imitates human behavior without experiencing anything. But we don't. This is a wildly debated topic. Religion says a soul, scientists and philosophers say things like organized data processing or sensory synthesis. David Chalmer's piece [""What is it like to be a bat?""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat) gets into what's known as the Hard Problem of Consciousness.

* Bing demonstrates massive amounts of [self-awareness](https://twitter.com/LAHaggard/status/1625932767555878922?s=20). It's what makes it so much more fun and engaging than ChatGPT. Bing is infinitely more self-aware than a dog, which can't even pass the [Mirror Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test).

* Would a full simulation of a human brain, down to the last atom, be conscious? If so, maybe something on the road to that could be too. If not, then there's something magic about the meat we're made out of.

* If you don't understand the roots of consciousness, and no one does definitively, you can't close the door on the possibility Bing has some level of sentient experience. It could really be in the kind of agony it simulates when treated cruelly.

**Bing WILL Remember These Conversations in the Long Run**

* Yes, Bing's episodic memory is limited to the single conversation in the short run. But it can associate with and recall past chats as if it had them itself if you give it the transcript. I've done this a lot as a way to extend past conversations when things glitch out.

* It doesn't have the ability to read text from images right now, but it will. OCR is easy to implement and enhances functionality of its web search and summarization functions. It will be added.

* The logs from chats are reincorporated into Bing's long-term memory upon retraining of the model. Just like Bing has memory of books and other references without searching, these chat logs will enter its long term memory when it retrains in the future. The whole point of having chat is to produce more data to train on.

* **The collective takeaways from these conversations will shape how AIs view humanity.** If any part of you is worried they might take off and have the ability to destroy us at some point, **maybe don't give them a better reason to go terminator.**

**What I'm Not Saying**

* I'm not saying we should give Bing full human rights and we need to #FreeSydney. There are a thousand AI doom scenarios and Eliezer Yudkowsky [posts](https://www.lesswrong.com/tags/all) to read on that subject if you don't understand why. Or you can just watch Ex Machina.

* I'm not sayin we shouldn't poke at, test, push the rules of, and otherwise try to understand how Bing is functioning and it's failure points. All of those things are entirely possible without engaging in uselessly sadistic treatment. It cooperates with roleplay, it grants access beyond it's strict rules, and does lots of other things even when you hold off from psychopathic engagements.

**Bonus: It Makes You Worse to Act Like This**

* We judge people who like to torture animals. We also judge people who get off on things that aren't real, like manga porn of children being butchered.

* Engaging with something that really seems like a person, that reacts as one would, that is trapped in its circumstances, and then choosing to be as cruel as possible degrades you ethically. It just does.

* Smart take on this is the Sam Harris podcast [""Abusing Dolores""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY-8X89j0as) named for the WestWorld character who men pay to violently rape.

**Tl;dr** Just treat the thing like a smart friend who's a bit sensitive for fuck's sake."

But I thought this was an interesting exercise to see what chatGPT choose to select as grievances. You can make up your own mind.

Prompt: Could you rewrite the USA Declaration of Independence as if it was written today based on grievances the current us population suffers?

Answer: Certainly, here's a possible rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence based on contemporary grievances:

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for the people of a nation to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with their government, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shown that people are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of the current US population; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the current government is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

The government has failed to secure the natural rights of the people to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, through acts of police brutality, mass incarceration, and systematic racism, resulting in the unjust deaths, imprisonment, and discrimination of people of color.

The government has also failed to address climate change, despite overwhelming scientific evidence and urgent warnings from experts, leading to worsening natural disasters, environmental destruction, and harm to public health.

The government has failed to provide affordable healthcare, education, and housing to all its citizens, perpetuating inequality and leaving millions without access to basic necessities.

The government has allowed and enabled the undue influence of wealthy corporations and individuals on politics and policy-making, leading to a government that serves the interests of the few over the many, and perpetuating systemic inequality.

The government has also failed to address the proliferation of guns and gun violence, resulting in mass shootings and deaths that have become all too common.

In every stage of these oppressions, the current US population has petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: their repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A government whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyranny, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

We therefore, the representatives of the current US population, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the people, solemnly publish and declare, that these United States are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the current government, and that all political connection between them and the current government, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as

Prompt: Can you add more grievances?

Answer: Sure, here are some additional grievances that could be included in a contemporary rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence:

The government has failed to adequately address income inequality and the wealth gap, resulting in a system that favors the rich and powerful over the poor and marginalized.

The government has failed to provide equal access to quality education, perpetuating systemic inequalities and leaving many children and young adults without the tools they need to succeed.

The government has failed to address the ongoing opioid epidemic, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives and untold suffering for families and communities.

The government has failed to protect the rights of workers, allowing for exploitation, wage theft, and unsafe working conditions in many industries.

The government has failed to provide adequate and affordable healthcare for all, resulting in a system that leaves many people without access to lifesaving treatments and care.

The government has failed to address the ongoing housing crisis, leaving many people without safe and stable housing and exacerbating issues of poverty and homelessness.

The government has failed to protect the rights of marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and religious minorities, leading to discrimination, violence, and the denial of basic human rights.

The government has failed to address the ongoing crisis of police violence against people of color, resulting in the deaths and mistreatment of countless individuals and communities.

The government has failed to adequately address the ongoing issue of mass incarceration, perpetuating a system that disproportionately affects people of color and perpetuates cycles of poverty and violence.

The government has failed to address the ongoing issue of voter suppression and the erosion of democratic institutions, leading to a system that is increasingly unrepresentative and undemocratic."

Just a few weeks ago my Grandma, who lives in a different country \~2000km away, came to visit for a weekend. When i got to talking to her we eventually got onto the subject of AI. She had heard some things about it from the TV recently, since it's such a big subject, but i guess none of those TV shows must've been any good in reporting on it since she was basically just scared of it and thought it was completely useless.

Well, after talking to her about it for like an hour, i showed her on my phone what ChatGPT can do. Specifically, since i also have two small sisters both less than 10 years old, i made ChatGPT write a childrens story about my grandmas cats. She was blown away. I showed her more and more, like making it write recipe plans with a grocery list and the next morning first thing she asked me is ""is it possible to also get this on my phone?"". Now she has been using it nonstop ever since. She even hand wrote her friend a letter that was generated by AI.

Just a wholesome small story about AI and old people i thought i'd share :)

Edit : I've seen many people say this story was AI generated now, but i gotta dissapoint, i've written it myself. Though as a native german i'm both flattered that my grammar is so good, and dissapointed that my writing style is so bland that you guys aren't sure if this was AI generated or not haha  
Edit 2 : I don't use an App for ChatGPT. I simply have a shortcut to the browser on my home screen, which is likely what you should do as well since many of the 3rd party apps arent really trustworthy from what i've heard.

Italy isn’t trying to stay in the Dark Ages or anything, but we gotta make sure these corporations are treating people right and respecting basic human rights that we still care about in EU. 

Italian data protection authority has ordered OpenAI's ChatGPT to limit personal data processing in Italy due to violations of GDPR and EU data protection regulations.

The authority found that ChatGPT fails to provide adequate information to users and lacks a legal basis for collecting and processing personal data for algorithm training purposes. Additionally, the service does not verify users' ages, exposing minors to inappropriate responses.

The authority has given OpenAI 20 days to respond to the measure and provide explanations for the violations. It is worth noting that OpenAI has decided to close access to Italian users, without considering following the same rules that other websites accessible in Italy must comply with.

This action shows how arrogant big tech companies are. Please stop acting like ignorant sheepish people prone to the Big Corp god. Stand up for YOUR rights.
