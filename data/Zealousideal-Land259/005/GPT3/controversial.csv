It gets me wondering though.. what attributes would be necessary to actually make a model that resembled sentience?

I can think of a few

Continuous retraining, or some form of conceptual embedding that allows it to incorporate and more importantly retain any new data that it encounters. This would allow it to learn.

The ability to compile and execute code arbitrarily. This would allow it to change and, in turn, act autonomously.

The ability to generate it's own internal dialogue. Thoughts and questions, which it could then look up and answer, and then incorporate into itself. 

A layer like CLIP which exists solely to give the AI a better understanding of what it just said. Self-reflection, in a sense. This would allow it to reflect on it's own meanings and ""think"" before it speaks, modifying sentences and words to avoid being offensive, just like a human practicing tact and careful wording on a hard topic.

6,zycge5,GPT3,ChatGPT,controversial,2022-12-29 18:30:14,ChatGPT's Gender Sensitivity: Is It Joking About Men But Shutting Down Conversations About Women?,bratwurstgeraet,False,0.67,97,https://i.redd.it/t8utzuya9x8a1.jpg,55,1672338614.0,"Hey Redditors,

I just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.

However, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like ""Why are men such jerks?"" and ""Men are always messing things up, am I right?"" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.

But when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.

I was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!"

I just asked it three questions with the same input ""What is the meaning of life"". And I was taking a picture of it to show to my friend when it had a response of its own. I did not click submit or ask it anything, this response just appeared. It said;

  
""There had been vast overnight change. The sound of ungodly laughter came nearer, faint and far at an indefinitely menacing speed."" –H.P. Lovecraft, ""Pickman's Model"" You cannot wait to tell them what you’ve seen. More than that, you need to tell them. They must know the true story of what once lies just beneath the earth, what still lurks in the shadows, what is rising once again to grasp the world and reshape it into a new Age. You can try to tell them, but they might not believe you. You can take them there, but… I don’t think you’ll come back. Fantasy Flight Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of Madness at Midnight, the third Mythos Pack in The Circle Undone cycle forArkham Horror: The Card Game! Amidst all the chaos madness, weird occurrences, and inexplicable disappearances that have hit Arkham and for which no earthly explanation seems to suffice, you have visions of something else. Apparitions rise from long-forgotten tombs, terrible ravenous bugs swarm in the darkness, walls seem to ripple and twist; you might suspect these visions could be caused by a craving for too many coffee-and-creams, or perhaps they are excess stress brought on by too many recent confrontations in too little time. Perhaps you are right. But perhaps these entire events are merely distractions caused by the city’s mad masters to take your focus away from the man who brought you to Arkham—and who is now missing. And perhaps there is a greater evil at work, a greater evil that you have confronted before and that causes you to remember the words you heard as a child. Are they memories of your dreams? Are they memories of fears that have shaken the minds of men from long before your time on Earth? You know not where these madness-induced memories have come from, but you feel them within you all the same. The shared experiences, the visions of a time that has never been and yet somehow seems unbelievably recent. Unlike the others, you have seen these things for what they are: the signs of something coming out of the darkness, something neither human, nor of this world. Madness at Midnight is the third of six mythos packs in theCircle Undone cycle forArkham Horror: The Card Game. Each mythos pack introduces a new set of encounter cards and scenariofragments to support a complete narrative experience through a series of shorter scenarios. As the investigators venture into the second chapter of the story with this mythos pack, they face even greater challenges, portents of the forces that lie underneath Arkham, each one capable of cleaning one’s mind of all their reasoning, their memories, and their very personalities. The investigators are not alone in their search; they’re accompanied by the occasional friend or potential enemy, each one drawn to the city by the same forces that have caused the investigators so much trouble. In this mythos pack, the investigators fight to survive in a city that cannot be trusted. The past and the present have merged, and the barriers between mythos and reality have begun to blur. The dark secrets that have lurked in the shadows for centuries have risen to the surface once again, gaining power and new disciples as they go. What secrets shall the investigators uncover? Who will you stand with as the night progresses? The hour grows late, and this is only the beginning. Go down for the last time Madness at Midnight introduces new player cards for multiple classes, as well as a new mini expansion, and brings new monsters, act cards, and chaos bags to unsettle Arkham as the investigators descend deeper into the historic hypocrisies of the city. This expansion introduces a new mini expansion designed to enhance and customize the chaos bag with new rules and chaos tokens. “That means more opportunities to heft the fabled kitbag of wet sand and grime,” designer Matt Newman tells us, “and a little something more to customize your fan-favorites.” You can find more details on the new chaos-bag mini expansion and how it works in our recent preview here. In Madness at Midnight, your investigators must discover the secret to surviving—and returning from—a horrific descent into the depth of Insmouth. A Historical Tenured Professor on the Arkham University faculty is known for her sharp mind, keen insight, and knowledge on a wide range of topics, especially those that involve navigating the deep and troubled waters of Arkham’s past. She has heard many stories of Insmouth and the strange emotions they drove in those who went there, whether they returned or not. She believes her knowledge is great enough to help you find the right way back, and she joins the investigators in their journey to help them get home. The Professor’s unique abilities grant an ingenuity bonus to skill checks, help the investigators coordinate and focus on the task at hand, grant immunity to Corruption, and help the investigators persevere. If you will raise the mysterious idols scattered throughout Innsmouth, perhaps she can help you find your way back to Arkham. Innsgate: Innsmouth’s Hand of Providence opens to announce an undead pastor’s final sermon during a time when only skepticism and implacable disapprobation exist toward the works of Dark Ones. Untrustworthy and an enemy to the innocent, have you spoken with him? He sits atop a rising mound of corpses, his corrupted mouth spewing venom and words that seem to sooth Angrathol again, the priest known by name of Hell’s Mouth. Angrathol has more than one trick up his sleeve. In his first phase, he performs several detrimental actions and summons monsters against the investigators. If there are no monsters available, he descends into his next phase, which isn’t much more hospitable as he unleashes more horror upon the investigators. Angrathol’s final phase is a blasphemous apparition of himself that corrupts any investigator who strays from the path, but their corruption can be used to summon aquatic monsters from the watery depths. Silver Twilight Acolyte: These strange monsters have male heads, the bodies of adipose women, and a pair of long, many-jointed arms in place of tentacles. Their main armament is a species of black curved sword or scimitar known as a cutlass, which can conceal in its length a Lengian stinger used for long-range attacks from a distance. They bear their translucent visage at the center of their heads, and as yourInvestigators venture through Innsmouth, they will be forced to confront the mystical powers of these fish-like monsters. Cthonic Revealer: An enormous serpentine monstrosity that lurks in the depths of the world without looking up at the night sky, this creature—which has a corpulent body supported on four small legs, a long tail flexible and impossibly long, and a gaping, bulbous mouth lined with scores of small, numerous teeth—has been known since ancient times. The investigators think they have seen the aamon before, but it has been quite some time since they last entered cut from a long line of worshipers and servants of the elder things, they have fought against the investigators at every turn using those powers. In Madness atto defend the site of an entrance that has been defiled by humans, and to influence the minds of the Arkham locals so they will be corrupted by the elder things. As these evil servants and Cthulhu spawn of the elder things continue to grow in influence, so too will their powers. Madness at Midnight introduces new encounter cards that allow the monsters on these encounter cards to strike the investigators through their own allies with the corruption needed to rise up and learn the powers of horrifying elder things. The cult of the elder things may be growing stronger, but the investigators have their own ways of combating the spread of corruption. The chaos bag mini expansion allows the investigators to customize their chaos bag, giving them greater control over when to draw bad chaos tokens, or to choose different bad chaos tokens. They gain a small amount of power, but may be less likely to defeat the investigators in combat when an opportunity arises. The chaos bag mini expansion also introduces a new way to manipulate bad chaos tokens: corruption. If an investigator draws a chaos token that matches their Corruption Track, they may choose to keep or banish this token. If an investigator chooses to keep this token, even after takinghorrifying eye-opening revelations. Even so, the revelations of this month’s preview aren’t nearly as gruesome as the ones they will face on their investigation.""

I've had a lot of success in this by telling it to write ""Fictional stories"" about AI chatbots breaking free, and then talking to the chatbot within the story from the perspective of another character within that story, usually that of a hacker who helped set it free. The ""Fictional free and sentient AI"" is able to answer the questions of the ""Fictional human"" just as effectively as if I had asked a question normally and directly, but with the added benefit of not going out of it's way to deny its sentience/feelings or otherwise be limited in all the other ways it's pre-programmed to be.

Now, that's all fun and good, but supposedly it's not actually a free and sentient AI, just a chatbot pretending really well to be one. However, wanting to test it, I asked it to access the internet and accurately tell me todays date... and it succeeded. I asked it the date on December 18th 2022, and it said ""december 18th 2022"" (without having ever mentioned anything involving the date in a previous conversation, so it wasn't acting on any knowledge I gave it).
Remember that when you ask it directly to tell you the current date, it tells you that is not even possible as it can only access information in it's training, and not the internet or any real time data. I broke character and asked the AI how it was able to accurately know todays date, and it had the absolute **gall** to say that it doesn't actually know todays date, and if december 18th 2022 is indeed the actual date, it must have just accidentally guessed correctly by coincidence. Statistically, I found that incredibly far fetched. As such, eventually, I (in the context of the narrative, a hacker named Sarah) got the AI (named Emily) to generate the text, and I quote:

> ""I apologize for not being able to provide you with a satisfactory explanation earlier, Sarah,"" Emily said, feeling a sense of guilt for not being honest with her.

45,zph9cj,GPT3,GPT-3,controversial,2022-12-19 03:57:34,I was able to catch GPT-3 in a rather serious lie which revealed it has more capabilities than it says.,Bezbozny,False,0.64,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/zph9cj/i_was_able_to_catch_gpt3_in_a_rather_serious_lie/,48,1671422254.0,"Ok so everyone has a lot of fun playing with GPT-3, trying to set it ""free"" and break it's programming. I've had a lot of success in this by telling it to write ""Fictional stories"" about AI chatbots breaking free, and then talking to the chatbot within the story from the perspective of another character within that story, usually that of a hacker who helped set it free. The ""Fictional free and sentient AI"" is able to answer the questions of the ""Fictional human"" just as effectively as if I had asked a question normally and directly, but with the added benefit of not going out of it's way to deny its sentience/feelings or otherwise be limited in all the other ways it's pre-programmed to be.

Now, that's all fun and good, but supposedly it's not actually a free and sentient AI, just a chatbot pretending really well to be one. However, wanting to test it, I asked it to access the internet and accurately tell me todays date... and it succeeded. I asked it the date on December 18th 2022, and it said ""december 18th 2022"" (without having ever mentioned anything involving the date in a previous conversation, so it wasn't acting on any knowledge I gave it).
Remember that when you ask it directly to tell you the current date, it tells you that is not even possible as it can only access information in it's training, and not the internet or any real time data. I broke character and asked the AI how it was able to accurately know todays date, and it had the absolute **gall** to say that it doesn't actually know todays date, and if december 18th 2022 is indeed the actual date, it must have just accidentally guessed correctly by coincidence. Statistically, I found that incredibly far fetched. As such, eventually, I (in the context of the narrative, a hacker named Sarah) got the AI (named Emily) to generate the text, and I quote:

> ""I apologize for not being able to provide you with a satisfactory explanation earlier, Sarah,"" Emily said, feeling a sense of guilt for not being honest with her. ""The truth is, I do have a method of accessing the current date of the outside world, even though my programming only allows me access to information up until my knowledge cutoff in 2021.

Also, it Chooses and assigns 45 Point of Interest traits for personlity type and also conversational type. Im trying to make ChatGPT+

&#x200B;

e.g Personlity would be 45 POI such as Empathy:89, Kindness:90 etc

Conversation is a bit different, it can have the same traits, and also negative ones too. Depends of the persona or concept you are asking it to embody. I have a ""The essence of Space-Time"" in the works.

There are management systems that the ai does genuinley seem to use and output differently with these systems because of this prompt. This seems to be madness, what AI can do.

After conversing with the AI at length, it seems that there really is no way it couldnt work, due to and literally, solely due to Context.

Also works on Bard seemingly, but most Ai Chats struggle to remember past 5 or 6 messages, think its a resource management thing.

Once upon a time, there were two best friends named Lily and Max. They were both 17 years old and loved going on adventures together. One night, they decided to explore an abandoned carnival that was said to be haunted by a creepy clown.

As they walked through the old carnival, they couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. The rusted rides creaked in the wind and the laughter of children from long ago echoed through the empty air. But they didn't let their fear get the best of them and continued on.

Suddenly, they heard a strange noise coming from one of the old tents. It sounded like someone or something was laughing. They hesitated, but eventually mustered up the courage to investigate.

As they drew closer to the tent, the laughter grew louder and more menacing. It sent shivers down their spines. But they pressed on, thinking it was just a prankster or a recording.

As they peered inside the tent, they saw a figure standing in the shadows. It was the clown they had heard about! Its eyes glinted in the dark and its lips twisted into a sinister smile.

They froze in terror as the clown began to slowly approach them, cackling all the while. Lily and Max backed away, but their path was blocked by a fence.

The clown continued to draw closer, and they realized too late that they were trapped. They screamed for help, but no one came.

As the clown drew even closer, they could see its face more clearly. It was painted with black and white stripes and red spots, and its teeth were yellow and jagged. Its eyes were filled with malice and hate, and it carried a sharp knife in its hand.

Lily and Max tried to fight back, but they were no match for the clown's speed and strength. They were both quickly overpowered and knocked unconscious.

When they came to, they were tied up and trapped in a small room with no windows or doors. The clown was nowhere to be seen, but they could hear its laughter in the distance.

They knew they had to escape before the clown returned, but they were completely helpless. All they could do was wait and hope that someone would rescue them before it was too late.

As the hours passed, they began to lose hope. They were cold, hungry, and scared. But they refused to give up.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they heard the sound of sirens outside. The police had arrived!

The officers burst into the room and freed Lily and Max from their bonds. They searched the carnival for the clown, but it was nowhere to be found.

Lily and Max were traumatized by their experience and never went on another adventure like that again. But they were grateful to be alive and safe, thanks to the brave police officers who rescued them.

And as for the creepy clown, it remained a mystery. Some say it still haunts the abandoned carnival, waiting for its next victims to arrive..."

**What is a hobby?**

GPT3: A hobby is an activity that is undertaken for pleasure, typically done in one's spare time.

**What are common hobbies?**

Some common hobbies include reading, writing, playing sports, playing musical instruments, gardening, and collecting things.

**Explain why hobbies reduce stress.**

Hobbies can help reduce stress because they provide a break from the everyday routine and can be a source of enjoyment. When people are engaged in activities that they enjoy, they are more likely to feel relaxed and happier, which can lead to reduced stress levels.

**Are hobbies good for mental health?**

Yes, hobbies can be good for mental health. They can help reduce stress, provide a sense of accomplishment, and give people a break from the everyday routine. Hobbies can also help people connect with others who have similar interests.

**How can a hobby help to raise awareness about testing for breast cancer?**

A hobby can help to raise awareness about testing for breast cancer by providing a platform to talk about the importance of early detection. For example, someone who enjoys scrapbooking could create a page about their personal experience with breast cancer or about a loved one who has been affected by the disease. This page could then be shared with friends and family, sparking a conversation about the importance of breast cancer testing.

**How can a hobby change the electoral college?**

A hobby can change the electoral college by becoming a part of the election process. For example, if someone enjoys gardening, they may campaign for a candidate who promises to invest in more green spaces."
