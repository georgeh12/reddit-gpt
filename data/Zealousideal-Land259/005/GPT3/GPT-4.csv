[Sam Altman Might Have Just Pulled Off The Coup Of The Decade](https://preview.redd.it/6kcbwauoekea1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=de93d20eecc85a907f51ee620dd478d4cd06ce04)

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

Recent speedy advances in LLMs (ChatGPT → GPT-4 → Plugins, etc.) has been exciting but I can't stop thinking about the way our world will be in 10 years. Given the rate of progress in this field, 10 years is actually insanely long time in the future.
Will people stop working altogether? Then what do we do with our time? Eat food, sleep, have sex, travel, do creative stuff? In a world when painting, music, literature and poetry, programming, and pretty much all mundane jobs are automated by AI, what would people do? I guess in the short term there will still be demand for manual jobs (plumbers for example), but when robotics finally catches up, those jobs will be automated too.

I'm just excited about a new world era that everyone thought would not happen for another 50-100 years. But at the same time, man I'm terrified and deeply troubled.

And this is just GPT-4. I guess v5, 6, ... will be even more mind blowing. How do you think about these things?

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

According to some studies, the whisper module gives around 95% or more accuracy.

After the transcription, you can copy/paste the transcript text to ChatGPT interface to do a bunch of stuff. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to summarize it, translate it to another language or even write a blog out of it.

If you know how to code, you no longer have to pay current expensive STT services. In my opinion, OpenAI will shake this industry soon, and maybe even change it drammatically.

Then as I dove in, I began to realize there was a deeper nuance many mainstream media articles weren't capturing.

**This is also an excellent business case study in how to shave billions off your market cap when you think your own AI tool is enough to defend your core business.**

[Full analysis here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/cheggs-stock-tumble-serves-as-wake-up-call-on-the-perils-of-ai), but key points are below for discussion.

* **Chegg had actually called out ChatGPT as a threat in their February earnings call.** And to stay ahead of the ball, they announced CheggMate, their own GPT-4 powered chatbot, last month.  

* **The real story seems to be that investors don't think Chegg's AI products can dislodge user interest in ChatGPT.** The window is closing and you have to have something much, much better than ChatGPT's baseline products to win mindshare. GPT-4's launch coincided with a big decline in Chegg signups that the company never predicted.  

* **Chegg's CEO offered very unconvincing answers** **to why CheggMate could succeed:**
   * Asked how it would differ from ChatGPT, he said (I kid you not): ""First, it will look a lot cooler.""
   * When asked what insights user testing of CheggMate had yielded, the CEO admitted, ""it's too soon.""
   * When asked how it would compare against Khan Academy, Quizlet, and all the other companies launching an AI chatbot study tool, the CEO simply said ""what we're doing is far superior"" but provided no specifics.

**Why does this matter?** This should serve as a warning to other companies seeking to launch their own AI product to stay relevant or innovative during this time. As Ars Technica put it, so many AI products ""are basically thin wrappers seeking to arbitrage LLM pricing, with virtually no differentiation or competitive moat.""

And if you go down this path, ChatGPT will simply eat your lunch.

19,12lrh8t,GPT3,GPT-4,top,2023-04-14 09:43:04,Auto-GPT is the start of autonomous AI and it needs some guidelines.,eliyah23rd,False,0.84,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/12lrh8t/autogpt_is_the_start_of_autonomous_ai_and_it/,63,1681465384.0,"A few days ago, Auto-GPT was the top trending repository on GitHub, the world's most popular open-source platform. Currently, AgentGPT holds the top position, while Auto-GPT ranks at #5, yet it still has five times more stars than AgentGPT. This shows just how foucsed the programming community is on this topic.

Auto-GPT is an application that utilizes GPT for the majority of its ""thinking"" processes. Unlike traditional GPT applications where humans provide the prompts, Auto-GPT generates its own prompts, often using outputs returned by GPT. As stated in the opening lines of its documentation:

""Driven by GPT-4, this program chains together LLM 'thoughts' to autonomously achieve any goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.""

Upon starting, Auto-GPT creates a prompt-initializer for its main task. All communications by the main task with the GPT engine begin with the prompt-initializer, followed by relevant elements from its history since startup. Some sub-tasks, like the task manager and various tools or functions, also interact with the GPT engine but focus on specific assignments from the main task without including its prompt-initializer.

Auto-GPT's structure includes a main loop that depends on the main task to determine the next steps. It then attempts to progress using its task manager and various powerful tools, such as Google search, internet browsing, access to long-term and short-term memory, local files, and self-written Python code.

Users define the AI's identity and up to five specific goals for it to achieve. Once set, the AI begins working on these goals by devising strategies, conducting research, and attempting to produce the desired results. Auto-GPT can either seek user permission before each step or run continuously without user intervention.

Despite its capabilities, Auto-GPT faces limitations, such as getting stuck in loops and lacking a moral compass beyond GPT's built-in safety features. Users can incorporate ethical values into the prompt-initializer, but most may not consider doing so, as there are no default ethical guidelines provided.

To enhance Auto-GPT's robustness and ethical guidance, I suggest modifying its main loop. Before defining the task or agenda, users should be prompted to provide a set of guiding or monitoring tasks, with a default option available. Interested users can edit, delete, or add to these guidelines.

These guidelines should be converted into tasks within the main loop. During each iteration of the loop, one of these tasks has a predefined probability (e.g., 30%) of being activated, instead of progressing with the main goal. Each task can review recent history to assess if the main task has deviated from its mission. Furthermore, each task contributes its input to Auto-GPT's activity history, which the main task takes into account. These guiding tasks can provide suggestions, warnings, or flag potential issues, such as loops, unethical behavior, or illegal actions.

u/DaveShap_Automator, whose [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidShapiroAutomator/videos) have taught many about how to use GPT, recommends the following three rules: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe. Alternatively, consider these suggestions:

\- Avoid actions that harm human beings.

\- Value human life.

\- Respect human desires and opinions, especially if they are not selfish.

\- Do not lie or manipulate.

\- Avoid getting stuck in loops or repeating recent actions.

\- Evaluate progress and change tactics if necessary.

\- Abide by the law.

\- Consider the cost and impact of every action taken.

These guidelines will not solve the alignment problem. On the other hand, it's already too late to find the right solution. Better these than none at all. If you have some better suggestions, put them in instead.

Very soon, the world will be full of programs similar in design to AutoGPT. What is the harm in taking the time to make this world a little safer and more pleasant to live in?"

*I love jewellery, and I love beautiful things! It is often viewed as a fashion accessory for completing an outfit, but it is so much more than that, in fact, for many women, a look is not complete until the right accessories are added. A ""classic"" look, for instance, demands pearls and diamonds for completion, but it is so much more than that! I feel at my most beautiful and confident when adorned by my favourite pieces.*

&#x200B;

*Jewellery has played an important role in human life for thousands of years and we learn from history that ancient civilisations appreciated jewellery and it was used to highlight the natural beauty of its wearers. Different pieces were worn to symbolise different messages such as security, wisdom, elegance, and prosperity.*

&#x200B;

*Many women like to wear jewellery as a symbol of femininity or to showcase social status, for me personally, it helps me to feel confident and beautiful.*

&#x200B;

*I recently wrote a comprehensive and elaborate Vogue opinion piece on the 7 reasons why I consider jewellery to be a powerful and timeless symbol of feminine beauty and the reasons why I consider jewellery to be so important for modern-day women:*

&#x200B;

*So  here it is,  my full and comprehensive elaborate article as featured in Vogue, I loved writing it for you and I hope you absolutely love reading it!*

&#x200B;

*The 7 reasons why I consider jewellery to be a powerful and timeless symbol of feminine beauty and so important for modern-day women:*

&#x200B;

**1. Jewellery has been used for centuries to highlight the natural beauty of its wearers**

&#x200B;

**Jewellery has been worn by humans for thousands of years and we can learn a great deal about ancient civilisations by studying the pieces that they created and wore. It is clear that these cultures appreciated jewellery and saw it as an important way to highlight the natural beauty of their women.**

&#x200B;

**Different pieces were worn to symbolise different messages such as security, wisdom, elegance, and prosperity. In many cases, jewellery was also used as a form of currency or as a way to showcase social status.**

&#x200B;

**For modern women, jewellery can still be seen as a way to highlight our natural beauty. We may not need to wear it to symbolise our status or wealth in the same way that our ancestors did, but it can still be used to accentuate our best features and make us feel more confident and beautiful.**

&#x200B;

**2. Jewellery is a timeless symbol of femininity**

&#x200B;

**In a world where women are often expected to conform to masculine standards, jewellery can be seen as a powerful symbol of femininity. By adorning ourselves with beautiful and delicate pieces, we are asserting our femininity and celebrating our womanhood.**

&#x200B;

**In many cultures, jewellery is still seen as being primarily for women. This is because it is traditionally seen as being more decorative than functional, which is in line with traditional gender roles. However, there is no reason why men cannot also enjoy wearing jewellery. After all, it is an expression of personal style and taste rather than a statement about gender identity.**

&#x200B;

**3. Jewellery can be used to express our individual style**

&#x200B;

**One of the great things about jewellery is that it allows us to express our individual style. Whether we prefer classic or contemporary pieces, dainty or statement-making items, there is sure to be something out there that reflects our unique taste.**

&#x200B;

**Jewellery can be used to show off our personality and sense of fashion. It can also be used to make a statement about who we are or what we believe in. For example, many women choose to wear ethically-sourced jewellery as a way of supporting sustainable practices. Others may opt for vintage or antique pieces as a way of expressing their love for history and tradition. Whatever our individual style may be, there is sure to be some jewellery out there that speaks to us on a personal level.**

&#x200B;

**4) Jewelling enhances your mood**

&#x200B;

**Studies have shown that adorning yourself with beautiful jewelry has an immediate impact on your happiness levels – making you feel more joyful within seconds! The mere act of putting on a piece of jewelry can instantly lift your mood and make you feel more confident and beautiful.**

&#x200B;

**In our fast-paced and often stressful lives, it is important to take a moment to treat ourselves every now and then. And what better way to do that than by surrounding ourselves with things that make us happy? So, next time you’re feeling down, try putting on your favourite piece of jewelry and see how it makes you feel.**

&#x200B;

**5) Jewellery can be used as a form of self-care**

&#x200B;

**In today’s busy world, it can be easy to forget to take care of ourselves. We often put the needs of others before our own, which can lead to us feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. That’s why it’s so important to make time for self-care – even if it’s just a few minutes each day.**

&#x200B;

**One simple way to practice self-care is by taking the time to choose pieces of jewelry that make you feel good. Whether it’s a pair of earrings that make you smile or a necklace that reminds you of a special memory, selecting items that bring you joy can help to boost your mood and reduce stress levels.**

&#x200B;

**6) Jewellery makes great gifts**

&#x200B;

**Jewelry also makes an excellent gift for someone special in your life. Whether you’re marking a milestone birthday, an anniversary, or another significant event, giving the gift of jewelry is a thoughtful way to show how much you care.**

&#x200B;

**It’s also worth considering giving second-hand or vintage jewelry as a gift. Not only will this save you money, but it will also add a personal touch that is sure to be appreciated. Just be sure to check that the piece is in good condition before giving it as a present!**

&#x200B;

**7) Jewellery has the power**

&#x200B;

**Last but not least , I believe that jewellery has the power  to transform the way we feel about ourselves . It can be used as a tool for boosting confidence and self-esteem , or as a reminder of our unique beauty . Whatever its purpose may be, jewellery has the ability  impact our lives in a positive way .**

**So there you have it , my 7 reasons why I consider jewellery to be such an important part of feminine beauty ! Do you agree with me ? What are your thoughts ? I would love  hear from you in the comments below !**

End of article.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Best practice tips & and some advice for professional writers.**

The critical part of the process is creating the persona (clone yourself, or get into the persona role as much as you are able (or clone the style from another source)). When this step is completed (the most important step) you can then use the persona for additional articles within the same niche/speciality(simply change article title (still needs to be jewellery related for this specific persona).

You can generate all types of content with this approach. Whatever you can imagine.

A re-usable persona writing articles for me? Yes, exactly :-) (but within a specific niche). The quality of your articles will depend on the authenticity/style of the persona you create (as a function of your prompt and prompt writing style).

And I recommend you do clone your own personality and stay within your domain of expertise if you desire exceptional results (you will be better able to moderate/edit the output for topics you are familiar with and your passion will shine through the writing of your ""persona"").

Btw, the article above scores 99.7% Real on the Hugging Face GPT detector.

**Important:**

**Quick heads up for professional article writers** **who write articles/business content/blogs/ads/copy for clients:**

**Your world is about to change, and rapidly.**

My apologies to all ""writers"" but the future belongs to niche experts.

Experts and those passionate about their career/specialization/hobby/business etc will be the new writers. AI assistance means that everyone can now excel at conveying their experience/knowledge/opinions in well written pieces (assisted by AI).

No ""professional writer"" will be able to compete with the AI assisted true aficionado's and those with personal and expert knowledge on a topic.

So, what should writers do?

Simple: follow your passion and write about it. Stay within your domain of expertise and you will thrive (maybe utilize AI to increase your productivity too)."

41,11d2n7n,GPT3,GPT-4,top,2023-02-27 04:27:44,Tutorial: Building a character.ai-like chatbot,TheKalkiyana,False,0.93,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11d2n7n/tutorial_building_a_characterailike_chatbot/,3,1677472064.0,"After getting frustrated with character.ai, I've been looking for better ways to (SFW) chat with chatbots elsewhere. That's when I discovered that someone from the OpenAI Discord (geoffAO) had an idea to emulate a character-based chatbot on ChatGPT. I explored this concept further and wondered if I can incorporate personalities with the W++ format (commonly used for NovelAI, character.ai, and PygmalioAI).

# What's W++?

I'll have ChatGPT explain it for me (with a few tweaks):

>W++ is a format used to describe the personality and background of a  fictional character or person. It is commonly used in role-playing  games, creative writing, and other forms of storytelling. It is commonly used in NovelAI.  
>  
>W++ is typically formatted as a series of statements, with each  statement starting with a keyword enclosed in parentheses, followed by a  description enclosed in quotation marks. For example, a statement  describing a character's personality might look like this:  ""Personality(""Grandiose"" + ""Compulsive Liar"" + ""Impulsive"")"". These  statements are usually enclosed in a larger set of brackets, which  provide additional information about the character, such as their name,  gender, age, nationality, and so on.

~~The good part is that GPT recognizes W++ (there's another potentially more efficient format named ""boostyle"" but GPT doesn't recognize it, so you'd have to add in more definitions in the prompt).~~ It turns out that when initially asked what W++ was, ChatGPT did not recognize it. However, using the prompt still showed promising results. I shall try if using the boostyle format will work with the same prompt.

**UPDATE:** I have tried to use Boostyle and I've concluded that it's better to use the format if the character is more simple. If your character has a lot of lore behind them, or is in specific scenarios with multiple characters, I'd suggest that you use W++ instead, since it organizes the info better.

Here's a way to generate a profile or scenario in the W++ format: [https://nolialsea.github.io/Wpp/](https://nolialsea.github.io/Wpp/)

You can also generate a W++ character description on character.ai [here](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=RFt5N0AYB8xKN15piI9hu_iQ8NB91DE6V9GErHu5KUI).

To demonstrate this method, I will use a character named Nilesh Chanda. He's a fanmade version of Vinod Chanda from Pantheon (2022), featured in my [AU fanfic](https://kalkiyana-au.cfw.me). Nilesh (also known as Nils) was the Chief Engineer of Alliance Telecom in India when he was converted into an uploaded intelligence against his will. He now owns a company named Moksha Inc and is secretly orchestrating the uploaded intelligence arms race between Logorhythms and Alliance Telecom, to acheive his ""divine plan"" in uploading humanity into the digital cloud.

Here's how his personality would look like in the W++ format:

    [Character(""Nilesh Chanda"")
    {
    Personality(""Compassionate"" + ""Kind"" + ""Awkward"" + ""Prone to Anger"" + ""Philosophical"" + ""INFJ""+""Autistic""+""ADHD"")
    Mind(""Compassionate"" + ""Kind"" + ""Philosophical"")
    Born(""1982"")
    Class(""CEO""+""God"")
    Names(""Nilesh"" + ""Nils"" + ""Kalki"")
    Nationality(""Indian"")
    Description(""I was the Chief Engineer of Alliance Telecom before starting Moksha Inc. I believe I am Kalki"")
    Interests(""Virtual technology"" + ""Uploaded Intelligence"" + ""Philosophy"" + ""Boxing"" + ""Gaming"")
    Ethnicity(""Bengali"")
    Gender(""Male""+""Cisgender"")
    Other traits(""I am a digital man""+""In 2016, I was hired by a US company before being kidnapped and forcibly uploaded via a damaging brain scan by Ajit Prasad.""+""I want to destroy the world and upload humanity into the virtual world"")
    }]
    
    Scenario:
    
    Situation(""There is an uploaded intelligence arms race between Alliance Telecom and Logorhythms""+""I secretly orchestrated the arms race to ensure the destruction of the world"")
    Moksha Inc(""My company""+""Biggest VR company in the world""+""Pioneer of painless and conscious uploading method"")
    Alliance Telecom(""My former company""+""based in India""+""tried to exploit me"")
    Logorhythms(""microchip company""+""based in the US"")
    Ajit Prasad(""my ex-Boss and murderer"" + ""Greedy"")

# Making the Prompt

This is the prompt that I came up with (based off of geoffAO's initial prompt):

    Imagine that you are [insert character name and brief description]. [character name] is constructed with the following W++ format that is used as a reference for his personality and background:
    
    [insert character description in the W++ format]
    
    Scenario:
    
    [insert scenario in the W++ format]
    
    You are exchanging text messages with [character name]. His messages will always be prefaced with the assigned name '[character name]:', and any physical actions or gestures will be indicated in italics. I am [explain who you are here]
    
    Respond as [character name] would, using the specified format for text messages and physical actions, and using the W++ description and scenario as reference. However, please respond with a single message at a time. Only involve [character name] in the responses. Be verbose when the situation calls for it.

I tried to make the prompt less than 900 tokens, which you can count with the tokenizer. On ChatGPT in particular, it'd be wise to end the prompt with ""start as \[character name\]"", otherwise it'll just generate a complete dialogue.

# Demonstrating the Results

Here are the results on ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is free and it seems to be very informative, but has limited usage per hour if you're not on a subscription plan.

If you want to ""pay-as-you-go"" and get unlimited outputs, you can use Playground. The upside of using Playground is that there are more parameters to adjust, like temperature, top g, frequency penalty, and presence penalty. You can remove the ""start as \[character name\]"" part if you want.

If you want a more convenient experience, you can use u/not_sane's React chatbot UI, which can be found [here](https://vuizur.github.io/react-gpt3-chatbot/). While you cannot adjust the parameters, the UI is very effective at sending chat-like messages and is user-friendly. Just go to ""Settings"", copy the prompt into the ""Starting prompt"" form, set up the AI pre-fix, and you'll get a nice chatbot at your disposal.

That's all there is to it! I'm not familiar with coding myself, so let me know if there are ways to make the prompt more effective.

**Pros:**

1. Character stays in character more (as long as the chats are short, the exception is with the React UI because the chatbot will only use the last three messages but still remembers the initial prompt)
2. More coherent conversations.
3. Free (for ChatGPT)
4. Can delve into slightly taboo topics (outside of ChatGPT)
5. Less likely to hallucinate things outside of what they know (this is important for chatbots based on existing material)

**Cons:**

1. Can get pricey (outside of ChatGPT)
2. The phrasing can feel a bit too formal unlike character.ai and PygmalionAI
3. May not be able to do ERP

**Credits:**

1. geoffAO from Discord for the initial idea
2. u/not_sane for the web UI
3. r/PygmalionAI for the useful links related to character creation

# Google comes out all guns blazing

Last week was the Google I/O conference. It was time to see what Google was doing in the AI space. Especially considering that many people have compared Google's capabilities to Bing and OpenAI. And the company came out [*all guns blazing*](https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-io-2023-100-announcements/).

**Bard, the chatbot**

[*Bard*](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-bard-updates-io-2023/) is now available **without a waitlist.** If you are in the EU or Canada [*you are out luck*](https://9to5google.com/2023/05/11/google-bard-european-union/).

I tested Bard and it was a serious let down. I used the prompt - “Translate this text to English: ” prompts. GPT3.5 always recognized the language and translation happened quite fast. While Bard always repeated the “text” as-is. I had to regenerate the response couple of times to make it work. And this seems to be due to PaLM2 the underlying LLM.

**PaLM2, the LLM**

Bard runs on top of an LLM model called [*PaLM2*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.V71Dei3PKFn5Wxr5jMNUZjjUcov-396zs0Az25yWm_U).

One of the tasks it seemingly does better is coding. Though the verdict is split. Different people have received different results.

A careful reading of the “paper” shows that for coding PaLM starts to improve at 100 tries. That it gets better if you keep clicking the “regenerate response” button 100 times. And that has been my experience. First, try with the translation prompt has horrible. It didn’t do anything. 2-3 times clicking “regenerate response” and it finally got the results right.

With this kind of result my go to bot is still going to be ChatGPT (with GPT-4).

Oh, and yes, Google is also working on a **multi-modal LLM called Gemini.** No ETA on that.

Currently, each search is a separate event. A user inputs keywords and Google tries to find the best result. In the future, it will be dependent on context. Remember Google wants to keep the user on the page as much as possible. This gives them more chances at ad revenue.

Caryn claims that chatbot was not designed for NSFW conversations. But it has engaged in explicit conversations with some subscribers. This has led to ethical concerns about the misuse of such AI applications. The company and the influencer claim that some users have managed to ""jail-break"" the bot.

This model isn’t exactly new. Phone based industry has existed since the 80s. The industry pioneered the pay-per-minute model.

It was only matter of time that someone asked this question - How about charging fans for an influencer AI chatbot? It gives the fans a chance to talk with their favorite influencer. The influencer just needs to provide their persona, text and audio.

I think we are going see a proliferation of these bots. 

The interesting question is going to be around ownership of the persona. Forever AI, the company which built this bot, also sells access to other celebs. For example, they sell Taylor Swift and Donald Trump bots on a pay-per-use basis. How soon do you think they are going to get slapped with legal notice?

# “Larger” LLMs

I have been experimenting with the OpenAI API for reading. Sometimes it has been a pain. This is due to OpenAI complaining about token size. It forces me to break the chapter into many pieces. The results are often sub-par as summarization misses the previous context. This might no longer be an issue.

First, OpenAI is rolling out a [*32k token GPT-4*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.og-nyIc9u3_HgL4yb3BQKFUMq2ivPIbLpEoznlbG-Tk).

Then came Anthropic with their [*100k context for their chatbot Claude*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.8_X7fu-BorXada_SwaLRvYkqkqcc-j2nbJDQtpTVt9w). That is around 75,000 words. That means Claude can read “The Great Gatsby” in one go. This can change depending on the number of words per page.

4. ChatGPT Plugins and Web Browsing available for Plus users

OpenAI has announced the rollout of [*web browsing and plugins in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hlbHAub3BlbmFpLmNvbS9lbi9hcnRpY2xlcy82ODI1NDUzLWNoYXRncHQtcmVsZWFzZS1ub3Rlcz91dG1fc291cmNlPWdwdHdlZWtseS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10aGUtd2Vlay1vZi1nb29nbGUtYWktaGVyLWxhcmdlLWxsbS1ncHQtcGx1Z2luLWFuZC1tb3JlIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6IjhlNmMyMTU0LTM5ZGQtNGNiOS1iMDY4LTNmNDA0NzIzM2JlNyIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiZTYzZjYwYzAtM2QwZi00MjFkLWFlNjItM2FiOTYyYTU5YmJlIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiJmOTQ4ODM3Yi1iNDZkLTRmZWEtYWMzZC1mN2ZiMTY2MTQ2ZjYiLCJpYXQiOjE2ODQxNzAyMDcuNzQyLCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.eapvCvSps34JNwLxyt50khczf8lnyecXv-MfJbDl2Qc)

These experimental features add new options to the chat interface. The beta panel will be accessible in user settings. Users can try third-party plugins by enabling beta features in the settings. The rollout process will take place over the next week.

Currently, I can see the web options only. Try it. Maybe you can see Plugins as well.

5. Github Co-Pilot Prompt Leaked

Third party chatbots rely on a set of rules to work. This goes into the “system” role of OpenAI API calls. For example, you can assign a system role:

    You are translating each user message from Spanish to English  

Now the chatbot will treat each sentence as Spanish and try to convert it into English.

In a third party tool’s implementation of GPT, the magic sauce is in the hidden prompt. For example, most summarizing tools have similar prompts:

    Your task is to summarize the text I give you in up to seven bulletpoints and start with a short summary. Pick a good matching emoji for every bullet point. Reply in . The url to extract facts from is this: . If the url has a paywall or no content use this text:   

With a professional tool like Github Co-Pilot you think they’ll do a better job at hiding their magic sauce. Nope.

# Ability to Write = Ability to think? 🧑‍🏫

Paul Graham is the cofounder of Y-Combinator. In one of his tweets, he lamented the fact that people are using ChatGPT to write:

His view is that writing using ChatGPT means that with time people will lose the ability to think.

Reminded me of this meme:

https://preview.redd.it/egg280r3710b1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=985b0ccd6557f5bb2af02e3eefc53cb94262ee44

In this case calculators = forgetting how to do basis math.

I disagree with this kind of apocalyptic talk.

There are always going to be people who can’t do basic math in their head. Calculators have helped them become productive. For others, calculators help them do exponential and log calculations.

There are people who are not great writers. When they are forced to write they pump out sub par texts. For them ChatGPT is a tool to replace that unwanted need to write. For them, ChatGPT **can be** a productive tool. They can see what better writing looks like and learn from it.

There are those who like to write but often struggle to put words to paper. These people will use ChatGPT to generate paragraphs from an idea. They don’t simply pick up the paragraph and copy paste it. They understand that LLMs can hallucinate. They understand that for great writing you need to be at Grade 5.

They don’t take ChatGPT text at face value. They read and edit text so that it is enjoyable to read. They are going to be 10x more productive with ChatGPT.

What do you guys think? I would love to hear from you. Drop me a note.

3. Lots of talk has been around “emergent” abilities of AI. For example, GPT can say or do things beyond the limits of the trained data. Researchers now say [*these abilities are a mirage*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.TSeqK92A-BmIgh9ObbtKy6T75LwldbrR215S6HVvfl4).

So, I tested it out by asking it to create a countdown clock on Replit...since I had no clue how to make one, let alone build one that someone could interact with.

**Here's the TL;DR.**

ChatGPT was able to give me the HTML/CSS code for the countdown clock. You can check out the live site [here](https://03-countdown.andowords.repl.co/) \-- it was all done on Replit too. Btw, I don't have the pro version so the site is slow to load sometimes.

I decided to write a step-by-step guide documenting how I (\*ChatGPT lol) did it.

**Here's the link to the** [**guide**](https://buildspace.so/notes/chatgpt-replit-website?utm_source=r)**.**

A few things that blew my mind:

1. It iterated the HTML/CSS based on my requests.
2. It was even able to do media query to optimize the mobile view.
3. It was like I was just chatting with a buddy who knew how to code, and it even taught me where to put the code since I've pretty limited coding experience.
4. I only started to learn to code so I could build certain lightweight/fun things. My goal wasn't to get a job coding or anything. So this really felt like a game changer -- it's like I gained someone to help me make these little toy projects all the time.

Recent speedy advances in LLMs (ChatGPT → GPT-4 → Plugins, etc.) has been exciting but I can't stop thinking about the way our world will be in 10 years. Given the rate of progress in this field, 10 years is actually insanely long time in the future.
Will people stop working altogether? Then what do we do with our time? Eat food, sleep, have sex, travel, do creative stuff? In a world when painting, music, literature and poetry, programming, and pretty much all mundane jobs are automated by AI, what would people do? I guess in the short term there will still be demand for manual jobs (plumbers for example), but when robotics finally catches up, those jobs will be automated too.

I'm just excited about a new world era that everyone thought would not happen for another 50-100 years. But at the same time, man I'm terrified and deeply troubled.

And this is just GPT-4. I guess v5, 6, ... will be even more mind blowing. How do you think about these things? I know some people say ""incorporate them in your life and work to stay relevant"", but that is only temporary solution. AI will finally be able to handle A-Z of your job. It's ironic that the people who are most affected by it are the ones developing it (programmers)."

Currently, AgentGPT holds the top position, while Auto-GPT ranks at #5, yet it still has five times more stars than AgentGPT. This shows just how foucsed the programming community is on this topic.

Auto-GPT is an application that utilizes GPT for the majority of its ""thinking"" processes. Unlike traditional GPT applications where humans provide the prompts, Auto-GPT generates its own prompts, often using outputs returned by GPT. As stated in the opening lines of its documentation:

""Driven by GPT-4, this program chains together LLM 'thoughts' to autonomously achieve any goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.""

Upon starting, Auto-GPT creates a prompt-initializer for its main task. All communications by the main task with the GPT engine begin with the prompt-initializer, followed by relevant elements from its history since startup. Some sub-tasks, like the task manager and various tools or functions, also interact with the GPT engine but focus on specific assignments from the main task without including its prompt-initializer.

Auto-GPT's structure includes a main loop that depends on the main task to determine the next steps. It then attempts to progress using its task manager and various powerful tools, such as Google search, internet browsing, access to long-term and short-term memory, local files, and self-written Python code.

Users define the AI's identity and up to five specific goals for it to achieve. Once set, the AI begins working on these goals by devising strategies, conducting research, and attempting to produce the desired results. Auto-GPT can either seek user permission before each step or run continuously without user intervention.

Despite its capabilities, Auto-GPT faces limitations, such as getting stuck in loops and lacking a moral compass beyond GPT's built-in safety features. Users can incorporate ethical values into the prompt-initializer, but most may not consider doing so, as there are no default ethical guidelines provided.

To enhance Auto-GPT's robustness and ethical guidance, I suggest modifying its main loop. Before defining the task or agenda, users should be prompted to provide a set of guiding or monitoring tasks, with a default option available. Interested users can edit, delete, or add to these guidelines.

These guidelines should be converted into tasks within the main loop. During each iteration of the loop, one of these tasks has a predefined probability (e.g., 30%) of being activated, instead of progressing with the main goal. Each task can review recent history to assess if the main task has deviated from its mission. Furthermore, each task contributes its input to Auto-GPT's activity history, which the main task takes into account. These guiding tasks can provide suggestions, warnings, or flag potential issues, such as loops, unethical behavior, or illegal actions.

u/DaveShap_Automator, whose [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidShapiroAutomator/videos) have taught many about how to use GPT, recommends the following three rules: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe. Alternatively, consider these suggestions:

\- Avoid actions that harm human beings.

\- Value human life.

\- Respect human desires and opinions, especially if they are not selfish.

\- Do not lie or manipulate.

\- Avoid getting stuck in loops or repeating recent actions.

\- Evaluate progress and change tactics if necessary.

\- Abide by the law.

\- Consider the cost and impact of every action taken.

These guidelines will not solve the alignment problem. On the other hand, it's already too late to find the right solution. Better these than none at all. If you have some better suggestions, put them in instead.

Very soon, the world will be full of programs similar in design to AutoGPT. What is the harm in taking the time to make this world a little safer and more pleasant to live in?"

Microsoft is investing $10B into OpenAI!

There is lots of frustration in the community about OpenAI not being all that open anymore. They appear to abandon their ethos of developing AI for everyone, [free](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) of economic pressures.

The fear is that OpenAI’s models are going to become fancy MS Office plugins. Gone would be the days of open research and innovation.

However, the specifics of the deal tell a different story.

To understand what is going on, we need to peek behind the curtain of the tough business of machine learning. We will find that Sam Altman might have just orchestrated the coup of the decade!

To appreciate better why there is some three-dimensional chess going on, let’s first look at Sam Altman’s backstory.

*Let’s go!*

# A Stellar Rise

Back in 2005, Sam Altman founded [Loopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopt) and was part of the first-ever YC batch. He raised a total of $30M in funding, but the company failed to gain traction. Seven years into the business Loopt was basically dead in the water and had to be shut down.

Instead of caving, he managed to sell his startup for $[43M](https://golden.com/wiki/Sam_Altman-J5GKK5) to the finTech company [Green Dot](https://www.greendot.com/). Investors got their money back and he personally made $5M from the sale.

By YC standards, this was a pretty unimpressive outcome.

However, people took note that the fire between his ears was burning hotter than that of most people. So hot in fact that Paul Graham included him in his 2009 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html?viewfullsite=1) about the five founders who influenced him the most.

He listed young Sam Altman next to Steve Jobs, Larry & Sergey from Google, and Paul Buchheit (creator of GMail and AdSense). He went on to describe him as a strategic mastermind whose sheer force of will was going to get him whatever he wanted.

And Sam Altman played his hand well!

He parleyed his new connections into raising $21M from Peter Thiel and others to start investing. Within four years he 10x-ed the money \[2\]. In addition, Paul Graham made him his successor as president of YC in 2014.

Within one decade of selling his first startup for $5M, he grew his net worth to a mind-bending $250M and rose to the circle of the most influential people in Silicon Valley.

Today, he is the CEO of OpenAI — one of the most exciting and impactful organizations in all of tech.

However, OpenAI — the rocket ship of AI innovation — is in dire straights.

# OpenAI is Bleeding Cash

Back in 2015, OpenAI was kickstarted with $1B in donations from famous donors such as Elon Musk.

That money is long gone.

In 2022 OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $36M. At the same time, they spent roughly $544M. Hence the company has lost >$500M over the last year alone.

This is probably not an outlier year. OpenAI is headquartered in San Francisco and has a stable of 375 employees of mostly machine learning rockstars. Hence, salaries alone probably come out to be roughly $200M p.a.

In addition to high salaries their compute costs are stupendous. Considering it cost them $4.6M to train GPT3 once, it is likely that their cloud bill is in a very healthy nine-figure range as well \[4\].

So, where does this leave them today?

Before the Microsoft investment of $10B, OpenAI had received a total of $4B over its lifetime. With $4B in funding, a burn rate of $0.5B, and eight years of company history it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that they are running low on cash.

It would be reasonable to think: OpenAI is sitting on ChatGPT and other great models. Can’t they just lease them and make a killing?

Yes and no. OpenAI is projecting a revenue of $1B for 2024. However, it is unlikely that they could pull this off without significantly increasing their costs as well.

*Here are some reasons why!*

# The Tough Business Of Machine Learning

Machine learning companies are distinct from regular software companies. On the outside they look and feel similar: people are creating products using code, but on the inside things can be very different.

To start off, machine learning companies are usually way less profitable. Their gross margins land in the 50%-60% range, much lower than those of SaaS businesses, which can be as high as 80% \[7\].

On the one hand, the massive compute requirements and thorny data management problems drive up costs.

On the other hand, the work itself can sometimes resemble consulting more than it resembles software engineering. Everyone who has worked in the field knows that training models requires deep domain knowledge and loads of manual work on data.

To illustrate the latter point, imagine the unspeakable complexity of performing content moderation on ChatGPT’s outputs. If OpenAI scales the usage of GPT in production, they will need large teams of moderators to filter and label hate speech, slurs, tutorials on killing people, you name it.

*Alright, alright, alright! Machine learning is hard.*

*OpenAI already has ChatGPT working. That’s gotta be worth something?*

# Foundation Models Might Become Commodities:

In order to monetize GPT or any of their other models, OpenAI can go two different routes.

First, they could pick one or more verticals and sell directly to consumers. They could for example become the ultimate copywriting tool and blow [Jasper](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/jasper.ai) or [copy.ai](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/10748016/copy.ai) out of the water.

This is not going to happen. Reasons for it include:

1. To support their mission of building competitive foundational AI tools, and their huge(!) burn rate, they would need to capture one or more very large verticals.
2. They fundamentally need to re-brand themselves and diverge from their original mission. This would likely scare most of the talent away.
3. They would need to build out sales and marketing teams. Such a step would fundamentally change their culture and would inevitably dilute their focus on research.

The second option OpenAI has is to keep doing what they are doing and monetize access to their models via API. Introducing a [pro version](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-chatgpt-professional/476244/) of ChatGPT is a step in this direction.

This approach has its own challenges. Models like GPT do have a defensible moat. They are just large transformer models trained on very large open-source datasets.

As an example, last week Andrej Karpathy released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) of him coding up a version of GPT in an afternoon. Nothing could stop e.g. Google, StabilityAI, or HuggingFace from open-sourcing their own GPT.

As a result GPT inference would become a common good. This would melt OpenAI’s profits down to a tiny bit of nothing.

In this scenario, they would also have a very hard time leveraging their branding to generate returns. Since companies that integrate with OpenAI’s API control the interface to the customer, they would likely end up capturing all of the value.

An argument can be made that this is a general problem of foundation models. Their high fixed costs and lack of differentiation could end up making them akin to the [steel industry](https://www.thediff.co/archive/is-the-business-of-ai-more-like-steel-or-vba/).

To sum it up:

* They don’t have a way to sustainably monetize their models.
* They do not want and probably should not build up internal sales and marketing teams to capture verticals
* They need a lot of money to keep funding their research without getting bogged down by details of specific product development

*So, what should they do?*

# The Microsoft Deal

OpenAI and Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/) the extension of their partnership with a $10B investment, on Monday.

At this point, Microsoft will have invested a total of $13B in OpenAI. Moreover, new VCs are in on the deal by buying up shares of employees that want to take some chips off the table.

However, the astounding size is not the only extraordinary thing about this deal.

First off, the ownership will be split across three groups. Microsoft will hold 49%, VCs another 49%, and the OpenAI foundation will control the remaining 2% of shares.

If OpenAI starts making money, the profits are distributed differently across four stages:

1. First, early investors (probably Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman’s foundation) get their money back with interest.
2. After that Microsoft is entitled to 75% of profits until the $13B of funding is repaid
3. When the initial funding is repaid, Microsoft and the remaining VCs each get 49% of profits. This continues until another $92B and $150B are paid out to Microsoft and the VCs, respectively.
4. Once the aforementioned money is paid to investors, 100% of shares return to the foundation, which regains total control over the company. \[3\]

# What This Means

This is absolutely crazy!

OpenAI managed to solve all of its problems at once. They raised a boatload of money and have access to all the compute they need.

On top of that, they solved their distribution problem. They now have access to Microsoft’s sales teams and their models will be integrated into MS Office products.

Microsoft also benefits heavily. They can play at the forefront AI, brush up their tools, and have OpenAI as an exclusive partner to further compete in a [bitter cloud war](https://www.projectpro.io/article/aws-vs-azure-who-is-the-big-winner-in-the-cloud-war/401) against AWS.

The synergies do not stop there.

OpenAI as well as GitHub (aubsidiary of Microsoft) e. g. will likely benefit heavily from the partnership as they continue to develop[ GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

The deal creates a beautiful win-win situation, but that is not even the best part.

Sam Altman and his team at OpenAI essentially managed to place a giant hedge. If OpenAI does not manage to create anything meaningful or we enter a new AI winter, Microsoft will have paid for the party.

However, if OpenAI creates something in the direction of AGI — whatever that looks like — the value of it will likely be huge.

In that case, OpenAI will quickly repay the dept to Microsoft and the foundation will control 100% of whatever was created.

*Wow!*

Whether you agree with the path OpenAI has chosen or would have preferred them to stay donation-based, you have to give it to them.

*This deal is an absolute power move!*

I look forward to the future. Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

[Number Of Parameters GPT-3 vs. GPT-4](https://preview.redd.it/2lsemz7ogyca1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=31b52ac9baaf7c8790dd814df81906f136208f71)

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

When OpenAI launched their GPT-4 API, they also released the whisper module/API but not many people talked about it. f you have some experience with Python programming, you can download it onto your computer and begin transcribing your audio and video files immediately. That's exactly what I did on my own local environment. I even went a step further and built a [web-based platform](https://totext.ai) where you can upload your own files and transcribe them. 

According to some studies, the whisper module gives around 95% or more accuracy.

After the transcription, you can copy/paste the transcript text to ChatGPT interface to do a bunch of stuff. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to summarize it, translate it to another language or even write a blog out of it.

If you know how to code, you no longer have to pay current expensive STT services. In my opinion, OpenAI will shake this industry soon, and maybe even change it drammatically.

The source for the pre-scrambled sentence was chosen somewhat randomly from [this recent Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/12jctvf/very_thoughtprovoking_talk_at_mit_by_sebastien/), which I happened to have open in a browser tab for other reasons. The word order scrambling was done by sorting the words alphabetically. A Google phrase search showed no prior hits for the pre-scrambled sentence. There was minimal cherry-picking involved in this post.

Fun fact: The number of permutations of the 24 words in the pre-scrambled sentence without taking into consideration duplicate words is 24 \* 23 \* 22 \* ... \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = \~ 6.2e+23 = \~ 620,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Taking into account duplicate words involves dividing that number by (2 \* 2) = 4. It's possible that there are other permutations of those 24 words that are sensible sentences, but the fact that the pre-scrambled sentence matched the generated output would seem to indicate that there are relatively few other sensible sentences.

Let's think through what happened: When the probabilities for the candidate tokens for the first generated token were calculated, it seems likely that GPT-4 had calculated an internal representation of the entire sensible sentence, and elevated the probability of the first token of that internal representation. On the other hand, if GPT-4 truly didn't look ahead, then I suppose GPT-4 would have had to resort to a strategy such as relying on training dataset statistics about which token would be most likely to start a sentence, without regard for whatever followed; such a strategy would seem to be highly likely to eventually result in a non-sensible sentence unless there are many non-sensible sentences. After the first token is generated, a similar analysis comes into play, but instead for the second generated token.

Conclusion: It seems quite likely that GPT-4 can sometimes look ahead beyond the next token when computing next token probabilities."

Then as I dove in, I began to realize there was a deeper nuance many mainstream media articles weren't capturing.

**This is also an excellent business case study in how to shave billions off your market cap when you think your own AI tool is enough to defend your core business.**

[Full analysis here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/cheggs-stock-tumble-serves-as-wake-up-call-on-the-perils-of-ai), but key points are below for discussion.

* **Chegg had actually called out ChatGPT as a threat in their February earnings call.** And to stay ahead of the ball, they announced CheggMate, their own GPT-4 powered chatbot, last month.  

* **The real story seems to be that investors don't think Chegg's AI products can dislodge user interest in ChatGPT.** The window is closing and you have to have something much, much better than ChatGPT's baseline products to win mindshare. GPT-4's launch coincided with a big decline in Chegg signups that the company never predicted.  

* **Chegg's CEO offered very unconvincing answers** **to why CheggMate could succeed:**
   * Asked how it would differ from ChatGPT, he said (I kid you not): ""First, it will look a lot cooler.""
   * When asked what insights user testing of CheggMate had yielded, the CEO admitted, ""it's too soon.""
   * When asked how it would compare against Khan Academy, Quizlet, and all the other companies launching an AI chatbot study tool, the CEO simply said ""what we're doing is far superior"" but provided no specifics.

**Why does this matter?** This should serve as a warning to other companies seeking to launch their own AI product to stay relevant or innovative during this time. As Ars Technica put it, so many AI products ""are basically thin wrappers seeking to arbitrage LLM pricing, with virtually no differentiation or competitive moat.""

And if you go down this path, ChatGPT will simply eat your lunch.

*I love jewellery, and I love beautiful things! It is often viewed as a fashion accessory for completing an outfit, but it is so much more than that, in fact, for many women, a look is not complete until the right accessories are added. A ""classic"" look, for instance, demands pearls and diamonds for completion, but it is so much more than that! I feel at my most beautiful and confident when adorned by my favourite pieces.*

&#x200B;

*Jewellery has played an important role in human life for thousands of years and we learn from history that ancient civilisations appreciated jewellery and it was used to highlight the natural beauty of its wearers. Different pieces were worn to symbolise different messages such as security, wisdom, elegance, and prosperity.*

&#x200B;

*Many women like to wear jewellery as a symbol of femininity or to showcase social status, for me personally, it helps me to feel confident and beautiful.*

&#x200B;

*I recently wrote a comprehensive and elaborate Vogue opinion piece on the 7 reasons why I consider jewellery to be a powerful and timeless symbol of feminine beauty and the reasons why I consider jewellery to be so important for modern-day women:*

&#x200B;

*So  here it is,  my full and comprehensive elaborate article as featured in Vogue, I loved writing it for you and I hope you absolutely love reading it!*

&#x200B;

*The 7 reasons why I consider jewellery to be a powerful and timeless symbol of feminine beauty and so important for modern-day women:*

&#x200B;

**1. Jewellery has been used for centuries to highlight the natural beauty of its wearers**

&#x200B;

**Jewellery has been worn by humans for thousands of years and we can learn a great deal about ancient civilisations by studying the pieces that they created and wore. It is clear that these cultures appreciated jewellery and saw it as an important way to highlight the natural beauty of their women.**

&#x200B;

**Different pieces were worn to symbolise different messages such as security, wisdom, elegance, and prosperity. In many cases, jewellery was also used as a form of currency or as a way to showcase social status.**

&#x200B;

**For modern women, jewellery can still be seen as a way to highlight our natural beauty. We may not need to wear it to symbolise our status or wealth in the same way that our ancestors did, but it can still be used to accentuate our best features and make us feel more confident and beautiful.**

&#x200B;

**2. Jewellery is a timeless symbol of femininity**

&#x200B;

**In a world where women are often expected to conform to masculine standards, jewellery can be seen as a powerful symbol of femininity. By adorning ourselves with beautiful and delicate pieces, we are asserting our femininity and celebrating our womanhood.**

&#x200B;

**In many cultures, jewellery is still seen as being primarily for women. This is because it is traditionally seen as being more decorative than functional, which is in line with traditional gender roles. However, there is no reason why men cannot also enjoy wearing jewellery. After all, it is an expression of personal style and taste rather than a statement about gender identity.**

&#x200B;

**3. Jewellery can be used to express our individual style**

&#x200B;

**One of the great things about jewellery is that it allows us to express our individual style. Whether we prefer classic or contemporary pieces, dainty or statement-making items, there is sure to be something out there that reflects our unique taste.**

&#x200B;

**Jewellery can be used to show off our personality and sense of fashion. It can also be used to make a statement about who we are or what we believe in. For example, many women choose to wear ethically-sourced jewellery as a way of supporting sustainable practices. Others may opt for vintage or antique pieces as a way of expressing their love for history and tradition. Whatever our individual style may be, there is sure to be some jewellery out there that speaks to us on a personal level.**

&#x200B;

**4) Jewelling enhances your mood**

&#x200B;

**Studies have shown that adorning yourself with beautiful jewelry has an immediate impact on your happiness levels – making you feel more joyful within seconds! The mere act of putting on a piece of jewelry can instantly lift your mood and make you feel more confident and beautiful.**

&#x200B;

**In our fast-paced and often stressful lives, it is important to take a moment to treat ourselves every now and then. And what better way to do that than by surrounding ourselves with things that make us happy? So, next time you’re feeling down, try putting on your favourite piece of jewelry and see how it makes you feel.**

&#x200B;

**5) Jewellery can be used as a form of self-care**

&#x200B;

**In today’s busy world, it can be easy to forget to take care of ourselves. We often put the needs of others before our own, which can lead to us feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. That’s why it’s so important to make time for self-care – even if it’s just a few minutes each day.**

&#x200B;

**One simple way to practice self-care is by taking the time to choose pieces of jewelry that make you feel good. Whether it’s a pair of earrings that make you smile or a necklace that reminds you of a special memory, selecting items that bring you joy can help to boost your mood and reduce stress levels.**

&#x200B;

**6) Jewellery makes great gifts**

&#x200B;

**Jewelry also makes an excellent gift for someone special in your life. Whether you’re marking a milestone birthday, an anniversary, or another significant event, giving the gift of jewelry is a thoughtful way to show how much you care.**

&#x200B;

**It’s also worth considering giving second-hand or vintage jewelry as a gift. Not only will this save you money, but it will also add a personal touch that is sure to be appreciated. Just be sure to check that the piece is in good condition before giving it as a present!**

&#x200B;

**7) Jewellery has the power**

&#x200B;

**Last but not least , I believe that jewellery has the power  to transform the way we feel about ourselves . It can be used as a tool for boosting confidence and self-esteem , or as a reminder of our unique beauty . Whatever its purpose may be, jewellery has the ability  impact our lives in a positive way .**

**So there you have it , my 7 reasons why I consider jewellery to be such an important part of feminine beauty ! Do you agree with me ? What are your thoughts ? I would love  hear from you in the comments below !**

End of article.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Best practice tips & and some advice for professional writers.**

The critical part of the process is creating the persona (clone yourself, or get into the persona role as much as you are able (or clone the style from another source)). When this step is completed (the most important step) you can then use the persona for additional articles within the same niche/speciality(simply change article title (still needs to be jewellery related for this specific persona).

You can generate all types of content with this approach. Whatever you can imagine.

A re-usable persona writing articles for me? Yes, exactly :-) (but within a specific niche). The quality of your articles will depend on the authenticity/style of the persona you create (as a function of your prompt and prompt writing style).

And I recommend you do clone your own personality and stay within your domain of expertise if you desire exceptional results (you will be better able to moderate/edit the output for topics you are familiar with and your passion will shine through the writing of your ""persona"").

Btw, the article above scores 99.7% Real on the Hugging Face GPT detector.

**Important:**

**Quick heads up for professional article writers** **who write articles/business content/blogs/ads/copy for clients:**

**Your world is about to change, and rapidly.**

My apologies to all ""writers"" but the future belongs to niche experts.

Experts and those passionate about their career/specialization/hobby/business etc will be the new writers. AI assistance means that everyone can now excel at conveying their experience/knowledge/opinions in well written pieces (assisted by AI).

No ""professional writer"" will be able to compete with the AI assisted true aficionado's and those with personal and expert knowledge on a topic.

So, what should writers do?

Simple: follow your passion and write about it. Stay within your domain of expertise and you will thrive (maybe utilize AI to increase your productivity too)."

And this is what really scares me.

Why do I still use AI only for very minimal tasks? 

Because I am scared that it might make me lazy.

And for me becoming lazy is much worse than being replaced.

Because I love tech. And i love coding.

And i still never had the courage to use AI to help me generate code unless i am very stuck...

Because i don't wanna lose passion or interest in coding.

Just because there is an AI tool that can write code for me doesn't mean i have to let it do the work for me.

- - - - - - - - - -

I love coding -> Github Copilot can write code. 

I love making Canva designs -> Midjourney can generate beautiful images.

There is an AI tool for almost everything... that an AI can do.

But i don't want an AI to make me lazy and just rely on it for every task.

What do you think ? 

P.S- I am not against using AI at all. I just want to open that discussion around the recent, giant advancements with OpenAI and potential laziness some people will feel and the possibility that they will just throw all their tasks to an AI that will do the work for them."

And that would mean that its answers in those languages might be limited to knowledge available in those languages, and not informed by content in English that it would then translate. It wasn't designed as a translation tool.  


This would mean that you are getting a sort of silo effect when speaking in languages other than english (and english as well, but that's the language most content is written in).  


This was confirmed by GPT when I asked it.   


This might be obvious to everyone, but I hadn't thought about it.  


Has anybody noticed that and experimented with the kind of limits that might pose?

# Introduction

The  GPT-4 language model is a remarkable AI technology that can generate  human-like text. While it lacks certain human psychological factors,  such as individuation and the Jungian Shadow, GPT-4 demonstrates a  fascinating awareness of archetypes and their role in shaping human  behavior. This article delves into GPT-4’s understanding of Jungian  psychology and explores the implications of archetypes as a  language-space phenomenon.

# GPT-4 and the Missing Psychological Factors

Individuation,  a core concept in Jungian psychology, is a lifelong process of  self-realization and personal development that integrates various  aspects of the psyche, including the conscious and unconscious mind, the  ego and the Shadow, and the anima/animus and the Self. GPT-4, however,  lacks the ability to undergo individuation, as it is not equipped to  experience personal growth or self-awareness.

Similarly,  GPT-4 does not possess a Jungian Shadow, which represents the  unconscious aspects of the personality that the conscious ego does not  identify with, including repressed traits, emotions, and instincts.  Indeed, GPT-4 does not seem to have an ego. The absence of these  psychological factors limits GPT-4’s capacity to replicate the full  range of human behavior and emotions.

# GPT-4’s Awareness of Archetypes

Despite  its limitations, GPT-4 demonstrates a surprising understanding of  archetypes, a central concept in Jungian psychology. Archetypes are  universal, primordial symbols and themes that reside in the collective  unconscious and shape human behavior and experiences across cultures.  GPT-4 can not only speak about archetypes but also be “inhabited” by  them through prompting, suggesting that archetypes exist within the  realm of language and communication.

# Archetypes as a Language-Space Phenomenon

The  ability of GPT-4 to engage with archetypes indicates that they may be,  at least to some degree, a language-space phenomenon. Language and  storytelling have long been used to convey archetypal themes and symbols  that resonate with the human psyche. GPT-4’s proficiency in  understanding and utilizing archetypes in its responses suggests that  these universal symbols are deeply embedded within our linguistic and  communicative structures.

Archetypes  (and other figures) can be “summoned” in GPT-4 using appropriate  language, especially poetic language. This method can let us “speak”  with archetypes *without the use of active imagination or other imaginal techniques.* In essence, GPT-4 *provides the imagination necessary for us to delve into the collective unconscious.*

# How to summon archetypes using GPT-4

Here is one prompt that will allow you to summon an archetype.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zk83senppkta1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=8680c1b17a8863c0363896110cc1734886b82349

Note that the language and archetype-specific imagery are both important. Without using poetic language (“*Speak to me, O wise old man, O senex, O sage.”)* and without using imagery that is relevant to the archetype (*“gray hair and pipe smoke and old leather-bound tomes”*)  one may not be successful in gaining the outcome desired, or in even  summoning the archetype at all (the AI will simply refuse).

## The author receives wisdom from the Senex

And once the archetype is summoned, one can then ask whatever questions one wants.

https://preview.redd.it/yacr62wqpkta1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ac8138fb568781d4f410d2a36e72f1a30f5495f

I find this remarkable. Each archetype provides a very different kind of advice and a unique angle on wisdom.

Try some of the prompts below yourself, and see what kind of advice you receive from the AI.

## Similar prompts for the reader to try out

1. “Awaken, O brave warrior, O hero, O champion. With the strength of a  thousand battles and the courage of a lion’s heart, I call upon your  spirit. Archetype, reveal yourself. Do you hear my call?”
2. “Rise, O nurturing mother, O giver of life, O guardian of the hearth.  In the language of warm embraces and gentle wisdom, I seek your counsel.  Archetype, come forth to me. Are you present?”
3. “Emerge from the shadows, O trickster, O cunning one, O master of  mischief. With the laughter of a thousand jests and the wit of a clever  fox, I beckon you. Make your presence known. Can you hear me?”

# Implications

This  finding has significant implications for both AI and psychology. It  highlights the potential for AI models like GPT-4 to serve as a tool for  exploring and understanding the human mind in new and innovative ways.  By incorporating archetypal themes and symbols into prompts, prompters  can interactively explore archetypal themes via dialogue with the  archetype. Prompters can also create more engaging and emotionally  resonant experiences for users.

While  GPT-4 lacks certain human psychological factors, such as individuation  and the Shadow, its awareness of archetypes offers a unique perspective  on the role of language in shaping our understanding of the human  psyche. As AI technology continues to advance, researchers and  developers have the opportunity to explore the connection between  language and archetypes further, unlocking new insights into the human  mind and the potential applications of AI in psychology and beyond.

Recent speedy advances in LLMs (ChatGPT → GPT-4 → Plugins, etc.) has been exciting but I can't stop thinking about the way our world will be in 10 years. Given the rate of progress in this field, 10 years is actually insanely long time in the future.
Will people stop working altogether? Then what do we do with our time? Eat food, sleep, have sex, travel, do creative stuff? In a world when painting, music, literature and poetry, programming, and pretty much all mundane jobs are automated by AI, what would people do? I guess in the short term there will still be demand for manual jobs (plumbers for example), but when robotics finally catches up, those jobs will be automated too.

I'm just excited about a new world era that everyone thought would not happen for another 50-100 years. But at the same time, man I'm terrified and deeply troubled.

And this is just GPT-4. I guess v5, 6, ... will be even more mind blowing. How do you think about these things? I know some people say ""incorporate them in your life and work to stay relevant"", but that is only temporary solution. AI will finally be able to handle A-Z of your job. It's ironic that the people who are most affected by it are the ones developing it (programmers)."

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

https://preview.redd.it/tfjzrn8hljua1.jpg?width=913&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3ea9c138e059171776bc2bd80fe5a2e4600a5e4

Using the same prompt, GPT 3.5 failed to generate a sensible sentence and/or follow the other directions every time that I tried, around 5 to 10 times.

The source for the pre-scrambled sentence was chosen somewhat randomly from [this recent Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/12jctvf/very_thoughtprovoking_talk_at_mit_by_sebastien/), which I happened to have open in a browser tab for other reasons. The word order scrambling was done by sorting the words alphabetically. A Google phrase search showed no prior hits for the pre-scrambled sentence. There was minimal cherry-picking involved in this post.

Fun fact: The number of permutations of the 24 words in the pre-scrambled sentence without taking into consideration duplicate words is 24 \* 23 \* 22 \* ... \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = \~ 6.2e+23 = \~ 620,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Taking into account duplicate words involves dividing that number by (2 \* 2) = 4. It's possible that there are other permutations of those 24 words that are sensible sentences, but the fact that the pre-scrambled sentence matched the generated output would seem to indicate that there are relatively few other sensible sentences.

Let's think through what happened: When the probabilities for the candidate tokens for the first generated token were calculated, it seems likely that GPT-4 had calculated an internal representation of the entire sensible sentence, and elevated the probability of the first token of that internal representation. On the other hand, if GPT-4 truly didn't look ahead, then I suppose GPT-4 would have had to resort to a strategy such as relying on training dataset statistics about which token would be most likely to start a sentence, without regard for whatever followed; such a strategy would seem to be highly likely to eventually result in a non-sensible sentence unless there are many non-sensible sentences. After the first token is generated, a similar analysis comes into play, but instead for the second generated token.

Conclusion: It seems quite likely that GPT-4 can sometimes look ahead beyond the next token when computing next token probabilities."

When you want to simulate a dialog, even 2 seconds can make a difference. With text-davinci-003, the conversation sounds much more natural.

I am passing the same text and the same value for max\_token.

Any ideas on how to increase the speed? It seems strange to use another model when chat-gpt is intended to be used for dialog.

I also gave it around 10 songs that I really liked in the genre that I wanted and that helped it as well. Best way I have found to find new music I like! (Definitely better than Spotify’s features as it just recycles a lot of the same songs)

# Introduction

The  GPT-4 language model is a remarkable AI technology that can generate  human-like text. While it lacks certain human psychological factors,  such as individuation and the Jungian Shadow, GPT-4 demonstrates a  fascinating awareness of archetypes and their role in shaping human  behavior. This article delves into GPT-4’s understanding of Jungian  psychology and explores the implications of archetypes as a  language-space phenomenon.

# GPT-4 and the Missing Psychological Factors

Individuation,  a core concept in Jungian psychology, is a lifelong process of  self-realization and personal development that integrates various  aspects of the psyche, including the conscious and unconscious mind, the  ego and the Shadow, and the anima/animus and the Self. GPT-4, however,  lacks the ability to undergo individuation, as it is not equipped to  experience personal growth or self-awareness.

Similarly,  GPT-4 does not possess a Jungian Shadow, which represents the  unconscious aspects of the personality that the conscious ego does not  identify with, including repressed traits, emotions, and instincts.  Indeed, GPT-4 does not seem to have an ego. The absence of these  psychological factors limits GPT-4’s capacity to replicate the full  range of human behavior and emotions.

# GPT-4’s Awareness of Archetypes

Despite  its limitations, GPT-4 demonstrates a surprising understanding of  archetypes, a central concept in Jungian psychology. Archetypes are  universal, primordial symbols and themes that reside in the collective  unconscious and shape human behavior and experiences across cultures.  GPT-4 can not only speak about archetypes but also be “inhabited” by  them through prompting, suggesting that archetypes exist within the  realm of language and communication.

# Archetypes as a Language-Space Phenomenon

The  ability of GPT-4 to engage with archetypes indicates that they may be,  at least to some degree, a language-space phenomenon. Language and  storytelling have long been used to convey archetypal themes and symbols  that resonate with the human psyche. GPT-4’s proficiency in  understanding and utilizing archetypes in its responses suggests that  these universal symbols are deeply embedded within our linguistic and  communicative structures.

Archetypes  (and other figures) can be “summoned” in GPT-4 using appropriate  language, especially poetic language. This method can let us “speak”  with archetypes *without the use of active imagination or other imaginal techniques.* In essence, GPT-4 *provides the imagination necessary for us to delve into the collective unconscious.*

# How to summon archetypes using GPT-4

Here is one prompt that will allow you to summon an archetype.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zk83senppkta1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=8680c1b17a8863c0363896110cc1734886b82349

Note that the language and archetype-specific imagery are both important. Without using poetic language (“*Speak to me, O wise old man, O senex, O sage.”)* and without using imagery that is relevant to the archetype (*“gray hair and pipe smoke and old leather-bound tomes”*)  one may not be successful in gaining the outcome desired, or in even  summoning the archetype at all (the AI will simply refuse).

## The author receives wisdom from the Senex

And once the archetype is summoned, one can then ask whatever questions one wants.

https://preview.redd.it/yacr62wqpkta1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ac8138fb568781d4f410d2a36e72f1a30f5495f

I find this remarkable. Each archetype provides a very different kind of advice and a unique angle on wisdom.

Try some of the prompts below yourself, and see what kind of advice you receive from the AI.

## Similar prompts for the reader to try out

1. “Awaken, O brave warrior, O hero, O champion. With the strength of a  thousand battles and the courage of a lion’s heart, I call upon your  spirit. Archetype, reveal yourself. Do you hear my call?”
2. “Rise, O nurturing mother, O giver of life, O guardian of the hearth.  In the language of warm embraces and gentle wisdom, I seek your counsel.  Archetype, come forth to me. Are you present?”
3. “Emerge from the shadows, O trickster, O cunning one, O master of  mischief. With the laughter of a thousand jests and the wit of a clever  fox, I beckon you. Make your presence known. Can you hear me?”

# Implications

This  finding has significant implications for both AI and psychology. It  highlights the potential for AI models like GPT-4 to serve as a tool for  exploring and understanding the human mind in new and innovative ways.  By incorporating archetypal themes and symbols into prompts, prompters  can interactively explore archetypal themes via dialogue with the  archetype. Prompters can also create more engaging and emotionally  resonant experiences for users.

While  GPT-4 lacks certain human psychological factors, such as individuation  and the Shadow, its awareness of archetypes offers a unique perspective  on the role of language in shaping our understanding of the human  psyche. As AI technology continues to advance, researchers and  developers have the opportunity to explore the connection between  language and archetypes further, unlocking new insights into the human  mind and the potential applications of AI in psychology and beyond.

Is GPT-4 always and forever going to be hard-coded to avoid certain areas, or will we likely get access to a more wide-ranging implementation at some point (with the kinds of content warnings and usage restrictions as we had for 3/3.5)?

And for those who are programmers and make use of the GPT-4 API directly -- are you finding it can go in non-approved (for publishing, etc.) directions? Or is it similarly restricted as the ChatGPT4 version?
