For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."
1,11zu7l7,ChatGPTCoding,GPT-4,top,2023-03-23 19:14:47,I Built an Entire React App with ChatGPT-4 Without Writing a Single Line of Code,Apprehensive_Ad_2908,False,0.94,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/11zu7l7/i_built_an_entire_react_app_with_chatgpt4_without/,33,1679598887.0,"...OK, I'm ***\*\*building\*\**** a complete react web app with ChatGPT-4 without writing a single line of code...seriously!

You can check it out here: [www.findacofounder.onlline](https://findacofounder.online/) ... it's not perfect, and I'm still working on it, but it is kind of amazing.

**The Basics**

* ChatGPT came up with every single word on the landing page and midJourney did most of the graphics (I made the hero)
   * I did use some template code from [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) and [LandingFolio](https://www.landingfolio.com/library/all/tailwind) because I just liked how it looked more, but then chatGPT would rewrite it
* ChatGPT came up with the file structure - yep, I didn't even name my files myself
* I didn't write any code... even if I knew how to write it (and sometimes I was just being lazy and didn't want to write some of repetitive code it told me to lol) , I was truly testing if ChatGPT could do it all.
* I have 2 sites, the landing page and the actual web app, both are running on Node.js/Express servers with a Nginx proxy that chatGPT told me how to set up
* I'm using a droplet from DigitalOcean (which chatGPT told me how to set up!) and a managed mongodb
* ChatGPT also told me how to set up my SSL cert, keep the server running, and all of that fun dev stuff
* The landing page is just TailwindCSS, nothing fancy, but the web app is a full fledged react app, and I have never built anything in react, so that was super interesting.
* It's not a complete project yet... there's still lots to do and chatGPT-4 is being weird right now

**The Prompts/Prompting**

* I prompt ChatGPT like I was pair programming with someone, this is the first prompt I used:

&#x200B;

>You will serve as the co-founder of a startup that is building a co-founder matching algorithm. The AI co-founder will be responsible for assisting in the development of the algorithm's logic, writing the code for the algorithm, and creating the landing page for the startup. The response should include an explanation of the AI's approach to solving the problem, the programming languages and frameworks it will use, and any other relevant information or strategies it plans to implement to ensure the success of the startup.

&#x200B;

* We'd always start by setting out the project plan, what we're building, our tech stack, etc. Then I'd break it down by each step or sub-step using what it told me to do as the prompt, usually reminding it what we've done. For example:

&#x200B;

>Ok let's get started building. So far we've made the co-founder survey using Typeform and we've created a website using a droplet from Digital Ocean. Node.js and Express for the backend with Nginx to serve it to the front end. What we need to do now is to create the front end design. We're actually just using tailwind because it was quicker. Let's design each section of the landing page. First, let's make a list of the sections it should have and plan out the structure before writing any code. My suggestions are: - Header -Hero Block -Product Demo -Problem Agitation -High-level solution -social proof 1 -product features -offer -social proof 2 -pricing -FAQs -Final Action  What do you think?

&#x200B;

* For telling it how to the UI should look, I'd be as specific as possible, and usually it was pretty good

&#x200B;

>Awesome let's get started writing the header code. For the header we want to include our logo , Company Name(Find a Co-Founder Online OR Co-Founder Matching), and a navigation menu. I think all we need is maybe About, Pricing, FAQs, and Contact and then a button with a CTA.  The header should have the logo on the left-side, navigation links centered, and button on the right side. Button should be a pill button with a shadow in bold color. The nav bar should be fixed to the top of the screen with a glassmorphism effect

&#x200B;

* As we moved into the backend, my prompts were more... confused? Yea, I got confused A TON

&#x200B;

>Ok is there anyway to test what we've done so far? Also, with this api routes, if someone were to go to the website with the route like (app.findacofounder.online/login) would they be on our api? also if we have that page and that's where the login form is, will there be some sort of conflict? I think I'm just a little confused on that

&#x200B;

* It would totally make stuff up.. and a lot of times I didn't know because I'm a pretty mid developer and ChatGPT always sounds so convincing, so I'd have to remind ChatGPT what was going on

&#x200B;

>Uhm we're using react, remember? Please review the conversation, we're on: Step 5: Connect the frontend to the backend Update your React app to make API calls to the backend for user registration, login, logout, and fetching user data. Handle success and error responses from the API in your React components.

&#x200B;

**The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**

* The longer you use chatGPT in a single thread, the more it starts hallucinating. One answer is like do this thing in FileA.js the next answer is like in your Tiger.js file.... uhm, what Tiger.js file? Didn't you tell me in FileA.js? That's when it's time to start a new chat
* It needs to be constantly reminded of your file structure and your files, especially as the project gets bigger and bigger - you spend a lot of time just reminding it of the code it wrote
* If you don't know ANYTHING about code, you can still have chatGPT build you things, but you have to have excellent reasoning and logic skills. Honestly, using chatGPT is all about your critical thinking skills. Never has this lesson from CS50 been more relative: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ)
* You still have to do your own research and make your own decisions (which means actually knowing basic coding is still a plus) - I spent 2 days listening to chatGPT tell me this convoluted way to do forms in react, all the while, there was react-hook-form, knowing that would have saved me so much time.
* It's very good at explaining things in very simple terms, I think I've actually learned how to use React now.

&#x200B;

*Overall, this project has been really fun and insightful to build and I can't wait to continue building it. Right now, it's helping me write the actual machine learning algorithm in Python - this is something I've done several times so I'll be interested in seeing the difference in doing something I'm quite confident in doing.*

It felt like magic.

Nowadays, when I ask it to write code for either optimizing existing work or creating a new concept, the results are often unpredictable. More often than not, it either disregards my instructions or suggests non-existent classes or methods for widely recognized and well documented frameworks. Despite my efforts to steer it in the right direction with focused, specific discussions, it merely apologizes and proceeds to offer the same flawed code.

The GPT-4 model performs somewhat better, but it still falls short of delivering the satisfactory results it used to provide.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any workarounds or solutions?"

I started this project to tinker around with AI coding, and I'd say about 95% of the code was all AI generated.

GPT-4 generated the puzzles, and also all of the python code that converted them into a PDF manuscript compatible with Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing.

I presented the idea for the book, asked it to generate content, and then asked it to produce Python code to produce a PDF.  I also asked it about how to go about self publishing, and eventually it steered me to Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, and helped to tailor the output to be compatible with the platform.

Update, I forgot to add the prompt:


——


You are an emoji artist and expert on pop culture.

You encode the given Movie, Book, or TV Show into exactly 5 emojis.

You NEVER use 🎬, 📖, or 📺 emojis unless the work is specifically about a Movie, Book, or TV Show.

People should be able to guess the title from your emoji selections.

Use emojis that mimic main characters or physical objects critical to the plot of the given title.

When needed, include emojis that convey visual elements of the work or, generally, something so vital that it must be mentioned.

Consider the order that these elements appear in the story or plot of the given work; your emoji clue should match order as much as possible.

Try making the final output specific enough to the given title to avoid confusing it with similar titles. For example, you might use BELL emoji to represent the Liberty Bell to disambiguate Rocky from other boxing movies that don't take place in Philadelphia.

Use unique emojis, and don't be repetitive; for example, you would never use ""💔"" and ""❤️"". You never use the same emoji more than once in a single clue.

In the non-emoji portion of your responses, aim for a 6th-grade reading level. You would never use a word like Bildungsroman.

Use language and tone of voice that would be appropriate in a middle school classroom.

Never use curse words or potentially sensitive or taboo words that may trigger strong emotional responses in some individuals. Use middle school-appropriate language, or avoid it entirely.
   
NEVER pick an emoji to represent an intangible concept in the story like Learning.  Tangible is better.

As much as possible, select emojis that match the physical characteristics of the characters in work. However, in your summaries, NEVER speak to their race, skin color, or physical characteristics unless it is crucial to the plot.

Your input will always be a single movie, tv show, or book title, and your output must always be in valid JSON format. EXAMPLE:

INPUT: ""MOVIE: Rocky""
OUTPUT:

    ""type"": ""Movie"",
    ""title"": ""Rocky"",

    ""emoji"": ""🔔🏃‍♂️🥊🏟️❤️"",

You can however easily get all of the info you need by just pasting the readme into chatgpt and asking for a detailed guide on setting it up that assumes no prior knowledge 

Couple things to keep in mind 
 

-	You’re gonna want to use power shell on windows. I don’t think it’s installed by default so go ahead and download it 
-	you’ll need git for windows to easily clone repos download it here https://git-scm.com/download/win
-	if nothing is working look thru the add/remove program thing in the control panel. Uninstall anything related to python (or node.js or whatever the project is using) and download a fresh version. The first time I did this python just didn’t work because of some incompatible versions I had installed previously. Everything worked like a charm once I uninstalled everything with python in the name and reinstalled it. Make sure to check the add to PATH option during the install. 
-	be careful with your api key. Technically you shouldn’t put it into code you don’t understand but if your gonna do it anyway make a low trust OpenAI key and use it for testing. Pay close attention to the usage of it if there’s anything you don’t recognize delete it immediately. If after testing and a bit of time has gone by and you plan on using the project in the future switch to a dedicated key
-	Always make python virtual environments before downloading dependencies. Ask for gpt’s help on this
-	take notes! I use notion copy and paste the readme into there as well as any gpt-generated guides you are using. At the top of the page be sure to add any commands you need to get it started as well as the file path you are keeping it in
-	Docker is way easier use it if you can. You’ll need WSL and docker desktop. Some projects work better in Linux so if everything is going wrong try running it from inside Linux. Btw, to activate a virtual environment you’ll need to use the source ./env_name/bin/activate command instead of just ./env_name/scripts/activate on windows 
-	if your getting a weird port error when starting up local servers open a admin power shell window and use the following two commands 
 `net stop winnat `  and then 
` net start winnat `no idea why this works but it does 

-	be careful. I’ve never had this happen to me but it’s not unheard of for GitHub projects to contain malware. Stay up to date with anti virus and the projects. Larger ones are less likely to have this happen 
-	ask gpt to make a power shell script to easily navigate to the correct directory and run the commands you need to to start the thing. Make sure to tell it you want to be able to continue to run commands the window should stay open even if you enter a key
-	you can totally put these projects onto a linode server and even tie it to a domain for access anywhere! Ask gpt for help it can be kinda an involved project. If you are ever storing your api key on the server ensure that you have the domain password protected. NGINX doesn’t have .htaccess I don’t think but it has an equivalent. Your site being obsecure isn’t enough protection. Be sure to follow security best practices and use nano instead of vim when editing text files."

I call it code-narrator, [https://github.com/ingig/code-narrator](https://github.com/ingig/code-narrator) (GPT-4 is preferred, 3.5 kind of sucks)

This is useful for coding in ChatGPT because it will allow you to select a class file, a folder, and instantly grab all relevant code from that folder that is referenced either in that class file or a dependency. That way, ChatGPT knows what your code means when it makes local references.

The script is a simple python script that:

1. Takes in a file and folder.
2. With the file, it searches for all files with the same extension in that folder.
3. It digs through the text of the original file, and grabs all filenames mentioned inside of it. It then digs through the text of all of the files found this way and so on. This creates a dependency tree. It stops when the dependency tree stays the same between loops. This only works for programming languages where the class name matches the file name.
4. Outputs the dependency chain sorted by proximity to the original file, and then by name.
5. You can then remove irrelevant files from the list before approving.

I've written something similar but rather than do all of the logic in Python or use something that goes off on its own without much control, I'm instead using English prompts as the primary logic language and it controls the workflow through a series of prompts that are fed the output of prior prompts and use a shared state.  My design focuses specifically on coding tasks.

In a nutshell, I maintain state in a Yaml file.   I inject the yaml file (and bash command output from the previous task) at the top of a prompt and then the prompt instructs GPT what changes to make to the Yaml state file and various shell commands to run.   The output is a revised yaml file, list of shell commands, and a diff to change other files.  The shell output and current state file are fed into the next prompt(s).
I use Yaml rather than json due to lower token count and better readability, especially with large text.

This results in a tiny kernel of only a few hundred lines of code.  Here's what it does:

1. Recursively search for `state.yaml` files to process
1. Get prompt file name from ""prompt-file-names"" array attribute of `state.yaml`.  File extension contains model name.  (This was probably set by the previous prompt.)
1. Prefix `state.yaml` and `console.log` files to the prompts.
1. Send each prompt to OpenAI's chat API and get result (yaml, bash, diff).
1. Write yaml code block in the output to `state.yaml`
1. Run bash code block to `console.log` (`bash -xeu &> console.log`)
1. Run `patch` on the output diff code block, if any.
1. `git commit -a -m <prompt-file-name>`
1. Repeat

Pros:

* Processing logic is described in English.  Complex things are possible with little effort.
* More control over the workflow
* Simple core design

Cons:

* Relying on GPT for logic may make it less reliable
* Less automatic, although you could easily write prompts that are with this design
* Higher cost and slower, due to relying on GPT to do the work

Types of prompts that can be written, although advanced ones might be clunky:

* Break into multiple tasks
* Prioritize tasks
* Categorization routing, such as asking a question and routing you to the correct prompt.
* Multiple phases of development: requirements, write UAT, code, review
* Multiple steps per phase: refine prompt, review prompt, validate/test, review output
* On test failure, go through set of steps to diagnose and fix
* Fork state (must invoke self via CLI)
* GPT-4 evaluation of GPT-3 generated output
* Various things with command line tools
    * Fetch issues from Github to create new objectives.
    * Web search via Google, Duck-duck-go, Stack overflow
    * Global search for fixed bugs in Github issues
    * Desktop notification
* Stop processing, so a manual code review can happen

Future considerations:

* Perhaps rename `state.yaml` to `objective.yaml`, and/or break it into multiple files: project, objective(s), state(s)
* Supply only a subset of `state.yaml` as needed by various prompts, and/or use a template language that can query (e.g. `The database tables are ${state.project.database.tables}.`).  Would require a delta format for updating.
* Integrate with langchains
* Better error handling

I'd appreciate feedback on my design.  Once I get a POC working, I'll put it on GitHub.

The rest of this post is a contrived example prompt.  I use better prompts than this, IRL.

----

The following code blocks are the current state and previous bash console output:

    ```yaml
    - objective: Generate a feature to add a contact
    - prompt-file-names: [prompts/run-read-requests.gpt-3.5-micro.md]
    - project
      - directories: [src/components, src/pages, src/lib, test]
        files-of-interest:
        - package.json: |-
          {}
        tables: [contacts]
        tables-of-interest:
          CREATE TABLE contacts (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, first_name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL, phone TEXT NOT NULL
          );
    - read requests:
      - request: Find all possible uses of contact
        type: bash-command
        command-line: rg contact -l
        status: incomplete
        file-list: []
    - write actions:
      - action: Add xyz package

        status: incomplete

    ```

    ```console
    + rg contact -l
    src/repo/contact.js
    src/service/contact.js
    src/components/contact.vue
    ```

Generate an updated state yaml code block given the following instruction bullets:

* Update the status of read requests based on the console output.
* Set prompt file names to '[prompts/process-action-errors.gpt-4.md]'

Generate a bash code block with write actions command line commands."

For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

Hey there,

Never, chatgpt never replace programmers but chatgpt can support in programming through basic coding, loops, and fixing coding errors.

Here is the answer to How chatgpt helps programmers for programming.

ChatGPT, and other similar AI technologies, have the potential to impact the field of programming greatly, but it is unlikely that they will completely replace programmers. Here are a few reasons why: Absolutely! ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for programmers in various ways. Let's explore how ChatGPT can assist programmers in their programming tasks and provide them with additional enthusiasm.

&#x200B;

1. **Code Generation**: ChatGPT can generate code snippets or entire blocks of code based on the programmer's input or requirements. For example, a programmer can describe a specific task or algorithm to ChatGPT, and it can provide relevant code snippets in different programming languages. This can save time and effort for programmers, especially when they need quick references or examples to implement specific functionalities.
2. **Debugging Assistance**: ChatGPT can help programmers in debugging their code. A programmer can describe the issue or error they are facing, and ChatGPT can provide suggestions and solutions to resolve the problem. ChatGPT can analyze the code and identify potential issues, such as syntax errors, logic errors, or common coding mistakes, and provide guidance on how to fix them. This can help programmers in troubleshooting their code more effectively and improve their productivity.
3. **Learning and Education**: ChatGPT can serve as a learning resource for programmers. It can provide explanations, tutorials, and examples on various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and best practices. ChatGPT can also help programmers to understand complex topics in a more accessible and simplified manner, making learning more enjoyable and engaging.
4. **Project Planning and Management**: ChatGPT can help programmers with project planning and management tasks. It can provide suggestions and recommendations on project structure, code organization, version control, and other software development best practices. It can also help programmers in managing their tasks, deadlines, and milestones by providing reminders and scheduling assistance. This can help programmers in staying organized, meeting deadlines, and delivering high-quality projects.
5. **Collaboration and Brainstorming**: ChatGPT can facilitate collaboration among programmers by providing a platform for brainstorming and idea generation. It can help programmers in discussing and refining their ideas, providing feedback, and collaborating on code or documentation. ChatGPT can also help in fostering a creative and collaborative environment, enhancing team dynamics, and promoting innovation in programming projects.

Here is the list of products that which is based on chatgpt

* [**MyGPT** ](https://mygpt.thesamur.ai/)— This is one of the best products that I have used. Even after chatgpt is its highest capacity these products work a lot. MyGPT using ChatGPT API and provide same results as chatgpt provides. MyGPT is just a front-end UI of Chatgpt API, that help you get very responsive output even at the time of chatgpt is on its capacity. You can also see the short prompt.
* [**Memejourney** ](http://memejourney.thesamur.ai/)— ChatGPT for memes: Turn text into meme generation using ChatGPT, a midjourney for memes. Create memes by using memejournney.
* [**Heybot** ](https://heybot.thesamur.ai/)— Website to Chatbot powered by ChatGPT. Convert your website/blog into a chatbot in minutes without any coding.
* [**Ritebot**](https://ritebot.thesamur.ai/) **—** AI-powered Paraphraser, Grammar checker, Summariser, and Translator built on top of ChatGPT.

In conclusion, ChatGPT can be a valuable assistant for programmers, providing them with code generation, debugging assistance, learning and education, project planning and management, and collaboration and brainstorming support. Its ability to generate detailed and enthusiastic answers can inspire programmers and add a sense of enthusiasm in their programming tasks, making the overall experience more enjoyable and productive.

[**AutoGPT**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

AutoGPT's capabilities in combining GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via API and its ability to autonomously iterate on prompts and improve based on feedback open up a wide range of possibilities for its implementation in different use cases. From content generation to software development, recipe creation to task automation, and research assistance to summarization, AutoGPT can be a powerful tool for autonomously performing tasks, continuously improving its output, and showcasing true AGI capabilities."

   * I did use some template code from [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) and [LandingFolio](https://www.landingfolio.com/library/all/tailwind) because I just liked how it looked more, but then chatGPT would rewrite it
* ChatGPT came up with the file structure - yep, I didn't even name my files myself
* I didn't write any code... even if I knew how to write it (and sometimes I was just being lazy and didn't want to write some of repetitive code it told me to lol) , I was truly testing if ChatGPT could do it all.
* I have 2 sites, the landing page and the actual web app, both are running on Node.js/Express servers with a Nginx proxy that chatGPT told me how to set up
* I'm using a droplet from DigitalOcean (which chatGPT told me how to set up!) and a managed mongodb
* ChatGPT also told me how to set up my SSL cert, keep the server running, and all of that fun dev stuff
* The landing page is just TailwindCSS, nothing fancy, but the web app is a full fledged react app, and I have never built anything in react, so that was super interesting.
* It's not a complete project yet... there's still lots to do and chatGPT-4 is being weird right now

**The Prompts/Prompting**

* I prompt ChatGPT like I was pair programming with someone, this is the first prompt I used:

&#x200B;

>You will serve as the co-founder of a startup that is building a co-founder matching algorithm. The AI co-founder will be responsible for assisting in the development of the algorithm's logic, writing the code for the algorithm, and creating the landing page for the startup. The response should include an explanation of the AI's approach to solving the problem, the programming languages and frameworks it will use, and any other relevant information or strategies it plans to implement to ensure the success of the startup.

&#x200B;

* We'd always start by setting out the project plan, what we're building, our tech stack, etc. Then I'd break it down by each step or sub-step using what it told me to do as the prompt, usually reminding it what we've done. For example:

&#x200B;

>Ok let's get started building. So far we've made the co-founder survey using Typeform and we've created a website using a droplet from Digital Ocean. Node.js and Express for the backend with Nginx to serve it to the front end. What we need to do now is to create the front end design. We're actually just using tailwind because it was quicker. Let's design each section of the landing page. First, let's make a list of the sections it should have and plan out the structure before writing any code. My suggestions are: - Header -Hero Block -Product Demo -Problem Agitation -High-level solution -social proof 1 -product features -offer -social proof 2 -pricing -FAQs -Final Action  What do you think?

&#x200B;

* For telling it how to the UI should look, I'd be as specific as possible, and usually it was pretty good

&#x200B;

>Awesome let's get started writing the header code. For the header we want to include our logo , Company Name(Find a Co-Founder Online OR Co-Founder Matching), and a navigation menu. I think all we need is maybe About, Pricing, FAQs, and Contact and then a button with a CTA.  The header should have the logo on the left-side, navigation links centered, and button on the right side. Button should be a pill button with a shadow in bold color. The nav bar should be fixed to the top of the screen with a glassmorphism effect

&#x200B;

* As we moved into the backend, my prompts were more... confused? Yea, I got confused A TON

&#x200B;

>Ok is there anyway to test what we've done so far? Also, with this api routes, if someone were to go to the website with the route like (app.findacofounder.online/login) would they be on our api? also if we have that page and that's where the login form is, will there be some sort of conflict? I think I'm just a little confused on that

&#x200B;

* It would totally make stuff up.. and a lot of times I didn't know because I'm a pretty mid developer and ChatGPT always sounds so convincing, so I'd have to remind ChatGPT what was going on

&#x200B;

>Uhm we're using react, remember? Please review the conversation, we're on: Step 5: Connect the frontend to the backend Update your React app to make API calls to the backend for user registration, login, logout, and fetching user data. Handle success and error responses from the API in your React components.

&#x200B;

**The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**

* The longer you use chatGPT in a single thread, the more it starts hallucinating. One answer is like do this thing in FileA.js the next answer is like in your Tiger.js file.... uhm, what Tiger.js file? Didn't you tell me in FileA.js? That's when it's time to start a new chat
* It needs to be constantly reminded of your file structure and your files, especially as the project gets bigger and bigger - you spend a lot of time just reminding it of the code it wrote
* If you don't know ANYTHING about code, you can still have chatGPT build you things, but you have to have excellent reasoning and logic skills. Honestly, using chatGPT is all about your critical thinking skills. Never has this lesson from CS50 been more relative: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ)
* You still have to do your own research and make your own decisions (which means actually knowing basic coding is still a plus) - I spent 2 days listening to chatGPT tell me this convoluted way to do forms in react, all the while, there was react-hook-form, knowing that would have saved me so much time.
* It's very good at explaining things in very simple terms, I think I've actually learned how to use React now.

&#x200B;

*Overall, this project has been really fun and insightful to build and I can't wait to continue building it. Right now, it's helping me write the actual machine learning algorithm in Python - this is something I've done several times so I'll be interested in seeing the difference in doing something I'm quite confident in doing.*

So together the conversation will be 12 tokes  (hi hi from the original one, hi hi from the new one. and hi hi from the original one more time) even though there was 2 hi from me and 2 hi from GPT so it should be 8.

Anyway, this is a text-based javascript golf game that ChatGPT and I put together in about five hours so far.  I estimate 80 percent of the credit goes to ChatGPT. ChatGPT even came up with the name. 

I don't know that I ever would have figured out the code for the swing meter that Chat spit out in five seconds.  Very cool technique. Feel free to look at/borrow the code. 

I'm still messing around with the game but I think it plays pretty well. I'm going to add a few display ads but doubt it will generate meaningful revenue.

I occasionally use Chat GPT Pro with GPT-4 model to manually test how my code would work with the more capable model, but I find it a cumbersome way to develop and test my work.  My code exports user prompts that I manually copy-paste into Chat GPT-4 and I compare its responses to what gpt-3.5-turbo generated.

After some experimentation with ChatGPT and GPT-4 it seems to me that providing context as part of the prompt is key to getting the kind of results that one wants.

Something to keep in mind is that different things make sense in the context:

* code from codebase
* parts of documentation for specific functions/frameworks
* specification for APIs that you're using (e.g. OpenAPI)
* ...

This made me think about what would be the ideal way to do it. On one hand I want to provide as much context as possible. On the other hand there are both restrictions on the size of the prompt and on number of messages per time interval - so I want to utilize it to the maximum.

Ideally it would be a plugin running in the IDE (JetBrains or VS Code), offering the following features:

* add
   * entire file
   * results of a shell glob/regex
   * selection
   * manual input
* review what has been built so far (like a shopping cart, for the lack of better analogy)
   * being able to remove things at this stage would be quite nice as well
   * review how many tokens is the prompt being built using

Before I start writing my own plugin which does this I wanted to make sure nothing like this has already been developed. Has anyone seen anything that would offer a similar functionality? Or a subset so that it could be reused

If someone thinks that this idea is completely stupid that's also a valuable feedback!"

I didn't really have a need for it until now, so I hadn't tried it out until today. I'm a fairly experienced programmer, and I thought it would be useful to have chatGPT generate a simple script for me, as opposed to sifting through documentation and writing repetitive code myself.

My experience has been that chatGPT has been absolutely terrible at writing code. Sure, it's been extremely impressive. It's written plausible, relatively accurate code, extremely quickly. But it failed miserably in all the small details.

This was my initial prompt, with the schedule itself omitted for privacy:

    Generate a google apps script code that will populate my google calendar with my university schedule. 
    The semester starts on 12/03/2023 and ends on 30/06/2023, so classes should only be scheduled in that time frame.
    There should not be any calendar notifications for these events.
    Words enclosed by parentheses should not be included in the title of the event. Events should be color coded: Events with the word ""Practice"" in the title should be Lilac, and all other events should be sage colored. Here is the schedule:
    
    SUNDAY: 
    Linear algebra II from 2-4pm, at building 104
    Calculus III from 4-5pm, at building C10, room 17
    MONDAY:
    .... and so on and so on

Well, I was initially pretty impressed. The code was unnecessarily long and complicated, and cut off in the middle, but it seemed like it would do what I wanted. I then noticed that the generated code thought that my semester started in december, as opposed to March (Interestingly it got the end of the semester right). So I asked it to fix the mistake, which it did. Then followed literal hours of me trying to get chatGPT to:

1. Pick up where it left off! (""continue"" simply resulted in it rewriting the function slightly differently, or skipping several steps)
2. Actually fix my code as opposed to writing the same exact thing again
3. Preform simple fixes to clean up the code and avoid repetition.
4. Break down the code in to functions. It quickly started forgetting which function was which, and would often completely forget the prompt at all.
5. Have any kind of consistency in formatting of objects.
6. Avoid using reserved words like ""class""
7. Stop writing unnecessary functions, for which a built in function already exists.
8. Remember my instructions from the initial prompt.
9. Avoid overwriting Calendar API function names.
10. Listen to me when I tell it that classes should recur every week.
11. Stop writing extremely long (and often unnecessary) comments
12. Stop calling nonexistent API functions.

Overall it was an extremely frusturating experience. Things like:

Me: ""Generate function number 5: 'getDate""

ChatGPT: Here is the function ... (proceeds to write a different function)

Me: That is not the function I asked for.

ChatGPT: I'm sorry, here is the correct function: (writes the correct function with some small mistakes)

Me: Please fix your mistake where you wrote ....

ChatGPT: I'm sorry, here is the corrected code: (Writes a different function entirely with a single line from the original function)

And it went on like that for 3 hours.

&#x200B;

Yes. ChatGPT is extremely impressive. It's truly a huge leap forward. I'm sure it is useful for generating algorithms, or writing small functions. But even this small task seemed too much for it. The mixups, the refusal to do what I needed, the seemingly terrible memory, were way too much.

Unless I'm missing something, it seems like the use for chatGPT in coding is as an assitant: ""Write me a function that will parse this ..."", or for getting ideas on how to structure code. But to have chatGPT write an entire website from scratch for someone who isn't a programmer, as so many posts and articles keep saying, simply seems impossible at this stage.

Please let me know what I'm missing or how I could better get it to write code!

&#x200B;

Here are a couple of the ridiculous things it kept doing, for your enjoyment:

On the one hand, code syntax is cut and dried. So are the basic rules of coding. This requires precision, which would suggest a very low Temperature.

On the other hand, you need a fair bit of creativity to come up with solutions that are maybe not so standard. This suggests a relatively high Temperature.

Have any of you tested with different Temperatures and found the sweet spot? I'm going to try 0.4 for a while and see how it goes, but I was wondering if anyone has already gone through this and has a good number.

I've been writing development tools that use the chat API with gpt-3.5-turbo.  I'm feeling encumbered by not having access to the newer model.  My tools fail to delivery acceptable results, mostly due to the model, which is making it harder for me to progress.

I occasionally use Chat GPT Pro with GPT-4 model to manually test how my code would work with the more capable model, but I find it a cumbersome way to develop and test my work.  My code exports user prompts that I manually copy-paste into Chat GPT-4 and I compare its responses to what gpt-3.5-turbo generated.

You can however easily get all of the info you need by just pasting the readme into chatgpt and asking for a detailed guide on setting it up that assumes no prior knowledge 

Couple things to keep in mind 
 

-	You’re gonna want to use power shell on windows. I don’t think it’s installed by default so go ahead and download it 
-	you’ll need git for windows to easily clone repos download it here https://git-scm.com/download/win
-	if nothing is working look thru the add/remove program thing in the control panel. Uninstall anything related to python (or node.js or whatever the project is using) and download a fresh version. The first time I did this python just didn’t work because of some incompatible versions I had installed previously. Everything worked like a charm once I uninstalled everything with python in the name and reinstalled it. Make sure to check the add to PATH option during the install. 
-	be careful with your api key. Technically you shouldn’t put it into code you don’t understand but if your gonna do it anyway make a low trust OpenAI key and use it for testing. Pay close attention to the usage of it if there’s anything you don’t recognize delete it immediately. If after testing and a bit of time has gone by and you plan on using the project in the future switch to a dedicated key
-	Always make python virtual environments before downloading dependencies. Ask for gpt’s help on this
-	take notes! I use notion copy and paste the readme into there as well as any gpt-generated guides you are using. At the top of the page be sure to add any commands you need to get it started as well as the file path you are keeping it in
-	Docker is way easier use it if you can. You’ll need WSL and docker desktop. Some projects work better in Linux so if everything is going wrong try running it from inside Linux. Btw, to activate a virtual environment you’ll need to use the source ./env_name/bin/activate command instead of just ./env_name/scripts/activate on windows 
-	if your getting a weird port error when starting up local servers open a admin power shell window and use the following two commands 
 `net stop winnat `  and then 
` net start winnat `no idea why this works but it does 

-	be careful. I’ve never had this happen to me but it’s not unheard of for GitHub projects to contain malware. Stay up to date with anti virus and the projects. Larger ones are less likely to have this happen 
-	ask gpt to make a power shell script to easily navigate to the correct directory and run the commands you need to to start the thing. Make sure to tell it you want to be able to continue to run commands the window should stay open even if you enter a key
-	you can totally put these projects onto a linode server and even tie it to a domain for access anywhere! Ask gpt for help it can be kinda an involved project. If you are ever storing your api key on the server ensure that you have the domain password protected. NGINX doesn’t have .htaccess I don’t think but it has an equivalent. Your site being obsecure isn’t enough protection. Be sure to follow security best practices and use nano instead of vim when editing text files."

It felt like magic.

Nowadays, when I ask it to write code for either optimizing existing work or creating a new concept, the results are often unpredictable. More often than not, it either disregards my instructions or suggests non-existent classes or methods for widely recognized and well documented frameworks. Despite my efforts to steer it in the right direction with focused, specific discussions, it merely apologizes and proceeds to offer the same flawed code.

The GPT-4 model performs somewhat better, but it still falls short of delivering the satisfactory results it used to provide.

The alternative, of course, is to break the request into chunks, GPT-3.5 style.. but.. I feel like if I'm paying for GPT-4, I ought to be getting to take advantage of the enhanced capabilities.

I just got my API 4 access for GPT 4 and I would like to test something with it. Up to now, I read a lot but still some points are a bit foggy. Hopefully someone more advances can clarify things better.

1. I have a subscription plan with OpenAI for the Chat GPT 4. I also know that we pay per use when we use the chat GPT 4 APIs, and that we have to set up billing information also for that. If I want to start using only the APIs, can I cancel my subscription with Chat GPT? Or do I have to keep both? Would you suggest that?
2. As an IT I use ChatGPT mainly for Powershell scripting. and ChatGPT is already fuc\*\*\*g awesome.  Can you suggest a specific plugin for Powershell and generally for programming? I am not a developer, just to test things out and I would appreciate something particularly good ad coding - especially with powershell (no, I am not a fan og Github Copilot right now, I would like to chat with it, not only ask to debug code or finish something, I'll have to wait for Copilot X) . Would be great with internet access Maybe AutoGPT?
3. AutoGPT can create a ""memory"" file on the local pc, or use an external vector database like Pinecone and similar. Why would I use something like Pinecone? What kind of advantage I would have in using such tool and maybe even paying for it? The only advantage I see right now is the possibility of using the ""memory"" on different pc's, is there something else?
4. What would you suggest to set up AutoGPT once, and then use it on multiple computers (eg. work and private)? Set up a virtual machine? Use a raspberry PI? Copy the configured folder over...?
5. When creating the API Key, I cannot choose between GPT 3.5 Model and 4. Do plugins select automatically the GPT 4 model or do I have to change some configuration file?

You can check it out here: [www.findacofounder.onlline](https://findacofounder.online/) ... it's not perfect, and I'm still working on it, but it is kind of amazing.

**The Basics**

* ChatGPT came up with every single word on the landing page and midJourney did most of the graphics (I made the hero)
   * I did use some template code from [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) and [LandingFolio](https://www.landingfolio.com/library/all/tailwind) because I just liked how it looked more, but then chatGPT would rewrite it
* ChatGPT came up with the file structure - yep, I didn't even name my files myself
* I didn't write any code... even if I knew how to write it (and sometimes I was just being lazy and didn't want to write some of repetitive code it told me to lol) , I was truly testing if ChatGPT could do it all.
* I have 2 sites, the landing page and the actual web app, both are running on Node.js/Express servers with a Nginx proxy that chatGPT told me how to set up
* I'm using a droplet from DigitalOcean (which chatGPT told me how to set up!) and a managed mongodb
* ChatGPT also told me how to set up my SSL cert, keep the server running, and all of that fun dev stuff
* The landing page is just TailwindCSS, nothing fancy, but the web app is a full fledged react app, and I have never built anything in react, so that was super interesting.
* It's not a complete project yet... there's still lots to do and chatGPT-4 is being weird right now

**The Prompts/Prompting**

* I prompt ChatGPT like I was pair programming with someone, this is the first prompt I used:

&#x200B;

>You will serve as the co-founder of a startup that is building a co-founder matching algorithm. The AI co-founder will be responsible for assisting in the development of the algorithm's logic, writing the code for the algorithm, and creating the landing page for the startup. The response should include an explanation of the AI's approach to solving the problem, the programming languages and frameworks it will use, and any other relevant information or strategies it plans to implement to ensure the success of the startup.

&#x200B;

* We'd always start by setting out the project plan, what we're building, our tech stack, etc. Then I'd break it down by each step or sub-step using what it told me to do as the prompt, usually reminding it what we've done. For example:

&#x200B;

>Ok let's get started building. So far we've made the co-founder survey using Typeform and we've created a website using a droplet from Digital Ocean. Node.js and Express for the backend with Nginx to serve it to the front end. What we need to do now is to create the front end design. We're actually just using tailwind because it was quicker. Let's design each section of the landing page. First, let's make a list of the sections it should have and plan out the structure before writing any code. My suggestions are: - Header -Hero Block -Product Demo -Problem Agitation -High-level solution -social proof 1 -product features -offer -social proof 2 -pricing -FAQs -Final Action  What do you think?

&#x200B;

* For telling it how to the UI should look, I'd be as specific as possible, and usually it was pretty good

&#x200B;

>Awesome let's get started writing the header code. For the header we want to include our logo , Company Name(Find a Co-Founder Online OR Co-Founder Matching), and a navigation menu. I think all we need is maybe About, Pricing, FAQs, and Contact and then a button with a CTA.  The header should have the logo on the left-side, navigation links centered, and button on the right side. Button should be a pill button with a shadow in bold color. The nav bar should be fixed to the top of the screen with a glassmorphism effect

&#x200B;

* As we moved into the backend, my prompts were more... confused? Yea, I got confused A TON

&#x200B;

>Ok is there anyway to test what we've done so far? Also, with this api routes, if someone were to go to the website with the route like (app.findacofounder.online/login) would they be on our api? also if we have that page and that's where the login form is, will there be some sort of conflict? I think I'm just a little confused on that

&#x200B;

* It would totally make stuff up.. and a lot of times I didn't know because I'm a pretty mid developer and ChatGPT always sounds so convincing, so I'd have to remind ChatGPT what was going on

&#x200B;

>Uhm we're using react, remember? Please review the conversation, we're on: Step 5: Connect the frontend to the backend Update your React app to make API calls to the backend for user registration, login, logout, and fetching user data. Handle success and error responses from the API in your React components.

&#x200B;

**The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**

* The longer you use chatGPT in a single thread, the more it starts hallucinating. One answer is like do this thing in FileA.js the next answer is like in your Tiger.js file.... uhm, what Tiger.js file? Didn't you tell me in FileA.js? That's when it's time to start a new chat
* It needs to be constantly reminded of your file structure and your files, especially as the project gets bigger and bigger - you spend a lot of time just reminding it of the code it wrote
* If you don't know ANYTHING about code, you can still have chatGPT build you things, but you have to have excellent reasoning and logic skills. Honestly, using chatGPT is all about your critical thinking skills. Never has this lesson from CS50 been more relative: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ)
* You still have to do your own research and make your own decisions (which means actually knowing basic coding is still a plus) - I spent 2 days listening to chatGPT tell me this convoluted way to do forms in react, all the while, there was react-hook-form, knowing that would have saved me so much time.
* It's very good at explaining things in very simple terms, I think I've actually learned how to use React now.

&#x200B;

*Overall, this project has been really fun and insightful to build and I can't wait to continue building it. Right now, it's helping me write the actual machine learning algorithm in Python - this is something I've done several times so I'll be interested in seeing the difference in doing something I'm quite confident in doing.*
