I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

I do **not** count alternative **frontend** projects because they just call the API from OpenAI. 
I do **not** consider alternative **transformer decoder** to GPT 3.5 either because the training data of them are (mostly) not for chat system.

> It is priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens, which is 10x cheaper than our existing GPT-3.5 models.

This is a massive, massive deal. For context, the reason GPT-3 apps took off over the past few months before ChatGPT went viral is because a) text-davinci-003 was released and was a significant performance increase and b) the cost was cut from $0.06/1k tokens to $0.02/1k tokens, which made consumer applications feasible without a large upfront cost.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

I have no idea how OpenAI can make money on this. This has to be a loss-leader to lock out competitors before they even get off the ground."

[video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

I did a quick experiment with Pytorch 2.0 Native scaled\_dot\_product\_attention. I was able to a single forward pass within 9GB of memory which is astounding. I think by patching existing Pretrained GPT models and adding more positional encodings, one could easily fine-tune those models to 32k attention on a single A100 80GB. Here is the code I used:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6csxe28lv9oa1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff8b48a77f49fab7d088fd8ba220f720860249bc

I think it should be possible to replicate even GPT-4 with open source tools something like Bloom + FlashAttention & fine-tune on 32k tokens.

**Update**: I was successfully able to start the training of GPT-2 (125M) with a context size of 8k and batch size of 1 on a 16GB GPU. Since memory scaled linearly from 4k to 8k. I am expecting, 32k would require \~64GB and should train smoothly on A100 80 GB. Also, I did not do any other optimizations. Maybe 8-bit fine-tuning can further optimize it.

**Update 2**: I basically picked Karpaty's nanoGPT and patched the pretrained GPT-2 by repeating the embeddings N-times. I was unable to train the model at 8k because generation would cause the crash.  So I started the training for a context window of 4k on The Pile: 1 hour in and loss seems to be going down pretty fast. Also Karpaty's generate function is super inefficient, O(n\^4) I think so it took forever to generate even 2k tokens. So I generate 1100 tokens just to see if the model is able to go beyond 1k limit. And it seems to be working. [Here are some samples](https://0bin.net/paste/O-+eopaW#nmtzX1Re7f1Nr-Otz606jkltvKk/kUXY96/8ca+tb4f) at 3k iteration.

**Update 3**: I have started the training and I am publishing the training script if anyone is interested in replicating or building upon this work. Here is the complete training script:

[https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c](https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c)

I will post an update after the weekend once the training has progressed somewhat.

**Post-Weekend Update**: After \~50k iterations (the model has seen \~200 million tokens, I know this is just too small compared to 10s of billions trained by giga corps), loss only dropped from 4.6 to 4.2 on The Pile:

https://preview.redd.it/vi0fpskhsuoa1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fccc5277d91a6400adc6d968b0f2f0ff0da2afc

AFAIR, the loss of GPT-2 on the Pile if trained with 1024 tokens is \~2.8. It seems like the size of the dimension for each token is kind of limiting how much loss can go down since GPT-2 (small) has an embedding dimension of 768. Maybe someone can experiment with GPT-2 medium etc. to see how much we can improve.

These are my discoveries after ~100 hours of extensive experimentation and ways I think it can be improved.,NepNep_,False,0.9,303,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12pqqg6/discussion_translation_of_japanese_to_english/,62,1681754083.0,"Hello. I am currently experimenting with the viability of LLM models for Japanese to English translation. I've been experimenting with GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 utilizing the DAN protocols, and GPT 4 for this project for around 3 months now with very promising results and I think I've identified several limitations with GPT that if addressed can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of translations.

&#x200B;

The project I'm working on is attempting to translate a light novel series from japanese to english. During these tests I did a deep dive, asking GPT how it is attempting the translations and asking it to modify its translation methodology through various means (I am considering doing a long video outlining all this and showing off the prompts and responses at a later date). Notably this includes asking it to utilize its understanding of the series its translating from its training knowledge to aide in the translation, and providing it with a ""seed"" translation. Basically the seed is a side by side japanese and english translation to show GPT what I'm looking for in terms of grammar and formatting. The english translation notably is a human translation, not a machine translation. The results from these tests provided SIGNIFICANT improvements to the final translation, so significant in fact that a large portion of the text could reasonably be assumed to be human-translated.

&#x200B;

Link to the project I'm working on so you can see my documentation and results: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT\_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

I've probably done around 50-100 hours of extensive testing with translation and methodology over the past 2-3 months. Over that time I've discovered the following:

1. Both GPT3 and GPT4 are significant improvements over traditional translation services such as google or deepl. This may be because Japanese and English are very different languages in how they are written and how their grammar works so prior translation services simply did a direct translation while GPT is capable of understanding the text and rewriting it to account for that. For example in japanese, there are no pronouns like ""he"" and ""her"" so a person's gender might not be clear from the sentence alone. Google Translate and DeepL typically just take a 50/50 guess, while GPT from my experience has been much more capable in getting this right based on understanding the larger context from the paragraph.
2. GPT has a tendency to censor text deliberately if it feels the translation may offend people. This isn't just for things that are blatantly offensive like slurs, it also includes mild sexual content, the kind that is typically approved for teen viewing/reading. The biggest problem is that it doesn't tell you it is censoring anything unless you ask it, meaning everything else may be a solid translation yet it may censor information which can ultimately hurt the translation, especially for story related translations like in my tests. These restrictions can be bypassed with correct prompting. I've had luck using GPT 3's DAN protocols however DAN's translations arent as strong as GPT 4, and I've had luck with GPT 4 by framing the translation as a game with extreme win and loss conditions and telling it that if it censors the translation, it may offend the author of the content since people in japan hold different values from our own.
3. GPT puts too high a focus on accuracy even if instructed not to. This is a good thing to a degree since outside of censorship you know the translation is accurate, however even when explicitly told to put maximum emphasis on readability, even if it hurts the accuracy, and it is allowed to rewrite sentences from the ground up to aide readability, it still puts too strong an emphasis on accuracy. I have determined this through testing that for some reason it is ignoring the request to focus on readability and will still maximize accuracy. The best way I've found to fix this issue is through demonstration, specifically the ""seed"" I mentioned earlier. By giving it a japanese and english translation of the same work but earlier in the story, it then understands how to put more emphasis on readability. The results is something that is 95% within the range of accuracy a professional translator would use while much easier to read.
4. GPT's biggest limitation is the fact that it ""forgets"" the seed way too quickly, usually within a few prompts. I've done testing with its data retention and it appears that if you give it too much information to remember at once it slowly bugs out. With GPT 3 its a hard crash type bug where it just spews nonsense unrelated to your request, however GPT 4 can remember a lot more information and will hard crash if you give it too much info but otherwise builds up errors slowly as you give it more info. I initially believed that there were issues with the token count, but further testing shows that the GPT model simply isn't optimized for this method of translation and a new or reworked model that you can give a seed and it will remember it longer would be better. The seed is one of the best tools for improving its performance

Next steps:

I would like to try to either create my own model or modify an existing one to optimize it for translation. If any1 knows any tools or guides I'd appreciate it."

*We introduce Alpaca 7B, a model fine-tuned from the LLaMA 7B model on 52K instruction-following demonstrations. On our preliminary evaluation of single-turn instruction following, Alpaca behaves qualitatively similarly to OpenAI’s text-davinci-003, while being surprisingly small and easy/cheap to reproduce (<600$).*

Basically, starting w an open source Meta 7B LLaMa model, they recruited GPT-3.5 to use for self-instruct training (as opposed to RLHF) and were able to produce a model that behaved similar to GPT-3.5. Amazingly, the process only took few weeks and $600 in compute cost.  

Any thoughts on how such low cost to train/deploy LLMs could affect companies like AMD, Nvidia and Intel etc? This seems like new idiom of AI tech and trying to wrap my head around CPU/GPU demand implications given the apparent orders of magnitude training cost reduction.

Abstract:

>Existing language models (LMs) predict tokens with a softmax over a finite vocabulary, which can make it difficult to predict rare tokens or phrases. We introduce **NPM**, the first **nonparametric masked language model** that **replaces this softmax with a nonparametric distribution over every phrase in a reference corpus**. We show that NPM can be efficiently trained with a contrastive objective and an in-batch approximation to full corpus retrieval. Zero-shot evaluation on 9 closed-set tasks and 7 open-set tasks demonstrates that **NPM outperforms significantly larger parametric models, either with or without a retrieve-and-generate approach**. It is particularly **better on dealing with rare patterns (word senses or facts),** and **predicting rare or nearly unseen words (e.g., non-Latin script)**.

I get to plot a histogram with the numbers and they are close to what I would consider an exponential distribution with such parameter (you can see the plot).

Given that GPT 3.5 does not have access to a Python interpreter, how on earth is it able to do so? I have also tried other distributions and parameters and it kind of works. It's not perfect, but with normal distributions it is usually close to what scipy.stats would generate.

I could understand that it can have learnt to interpret Python code to some extent, but honestly I can't find explanation for random sampling from a probability distribution. For a Normal distribution, I can tell it about the desired mean and variance, and it samples values that are more than reasonable (and close to the true mean/variance specified).

Any thoughts? I honestly am unable to wrap my head around how a LLM can have the understanding on how to sample tokens (at digit level) to fit any probability distribution. To me it seems very unlikely to have similar data either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages."

I'm not exactly a tech person, so some of these observations might be obvious to some of you, but I think they're worth sharing for those with less experience or who aren't directly in the field.

**Intro:**

In early February, my friends and I started a side project where we aimed to build an AI portal called DoMoreAI. For the first two months, we focused on creating an AI tools catalog. Our experiment is based on the idea that in the future, companies will be ""Managed by AI, and Driven by Humans."" So, our goal was to leave as much as possible to AI and automation, with all the consequences that come with it. As mentioned before, I'm not a tech guy, but I've been playing with OpenAI models for the past few years, so I had some experience when starting this project.

**Tasks We Assigned to AI:**

Based on an AI tool's front page, we had the AI write a one-sentence summary of an AI project + write a more in-depth review of the project, categorize the project into different categories (WHAT category, like blog; TASK category, like writing; FOR category, like content creator), decide if the project offers iOS app, Android app, browser extension, API, find social media links, process information about prices and pricing policy, and more.

**Interesting Findings:**

1. When working on a more complex prompt, particularly one with several tasks, you have to be patient when crafting it. You might eventually find the right wording to achieve the desired results, but it takes time and lots of trial and error. You might even be surprised by what works and what doesn't. 
2. If cost isn't an issue, you can always break up one complex prompt into several smaller prompts. However, the more requests you send, the higher the chance of encountering errors like the 429 error, which may require setting up more sophisticated error handlers for the whole process. 
3. You need error handlers because, without them, the automation process will suffer. 
4. With more complex prompts, there are no prompts that always yield the expected results, so you have to plan for what to do if the results aren't satisfactory and how to determine if the result meets your expectations or not. 
5. GPT-3.0 struggled with outputting JSON strings as requested, but GPT-3.5 is much better at this task. I'd say the number of errors from improperly formatting the response in JSON is 3-4 times lower for GPT-3.5. 
6. AI models have trouble distinguishing words singular forms from plural forms. 
7. Just because you can use AI for a given task doesn't mean you should. Often, standard techniques like using regex can yield better results when extracting something from text than relying solely on AI. A hybrid solution often provides the best results. 
8. We're using ADA vector embeddings and Pinecone for semantic search in our catalog, and I was really surprised to find that this kind of semantic search works in any language. Even if all the content on our page is in English, you can search in another language and still get decent results.

**The Best Mishaps:**

* As you may know, there's a token limit for requests, so we have to ensure that we don't send too long a part of the front page to the model. Sometimes, this led to funny situations. If the HTML of the page consists mainly of styles and the model is fed only with styles, then when you ask the AI to write a review of the project, it writes about how beautiful, mobile-friendly, etc., the project is. 
* For one project, instead of writing the one-sentence summary, the model's output only included the prompt we were using to generate the summary (needless to say, it was automatically published on our website ;))

## What

### Godot 

The Godot Engine is a free, all-in-one, cross-platform game engine that makes it easy for you to create 2D and 3D games.

### RWKV

RWKV is an RNN with Transformer-level LLM performance, which can also be directly trained like a GPT transformer (parallelizable). And it's 100% attention-free. You only need the hidden state at position t to compute the state at position t+1.

### RWKV-CPP-CUDA

RWKV-CPP-CUDA is a c++/cuda library I created that implements the RWKV inference code in pure cuda. This allows for compiled code with no torch or python dependencies, while allowing the full use of GPU acceleration.
The code implements 8bit inference, allowing for quick and light inference.

### Godot+RWKV

Godot+RWKV is a Godot module that I developed using RWKV-CPP-CUDA, and allows the development of games and programs using RWKV to be developed and distributed using godot, without the need to install complex environments and libraries, for both developers and consumers.

## Why

* I felt I could achieve it
* Its something thats needed to advance the use of AI in consumer devices
* The lols
* Attention, because I didnt get much growing up, and RWKV has none
* ADHD hyperfocus

## How

* Download a model (preconverted models pending)
* Convert the model (requires torch to pack tensors into raw binary)
* Download the tokenizer files
* Create a game in godot
* Distribute the game
* Profit

Example Code:

```python
extends Node2D
var zrkv = GodotRWKV.new()

# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready():
	zrkv.loadModel(""/path/to/model.bin"")
	zrkv.loadTokenizer(""/path/to/folder/with/vocab/"")
	zrkv.loadContext(""Hello, my name is Nathan, and I have been trying to reach you about your cars extended warrenty."")
# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func _process(delta):
	# number of tokens to generate, temperature, tau
	print(zrkv.forward(5,0.9,0.7))
```

## When

* Pls submit PRs if you want them sooner

Soon:

* Windows support (Just needs some scons magic)
* AMD Support (Just needs some HIPify magic)
* CPU mode (Just needs some ggml)
* CPU offload (needs ggml and effort)
* Preconverted models

**Live demo:** [**https://www.glaciermd.com/search**](https://www.glaciermd.com/search?utm_campaign=reddit_post_1)

**Background**

I've been working for a while on building a better version of WebMD, and I recently started playing around with LLMs, trying to figure out if there was anything useful there.

The problem with the current batch of ""predict-next-token"" LLMs is that they hallucinate—you can ask ChatGPT to answer medical questions, but it'll either

1. Refuse to answer (not great)
2. Give a completely false answer (really super bad)

So I spent some time trying to coax these LLMs to give answers based on a very specific set of inputs (peer-reviewed medical research) to see if I could get more accurate answers. And I did!

The best part is you can actually trace the final answer back to the original sources, which will hopefully instill some confidence in the result.

Here's how it works:

1. User types in a question
2. Pull top \~800 studies from Semantic Scholar and Pubmed
3. Re-rank using `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`
4. Ask `text-davinci-003` to answer the question based on the top 10 studies (if possible)
5. Summarize those answers using `text-davinci-003`

Would love to hear what people think (and if there's a better/cheaper way to do it!).

The world has changed quite a lot since we first got started. When EleutherAI was founded, the largest open source GPT-3-style language model in the world had 1.5B parameters. GPT-3 itself was not available for researchers to study without special access from OpenAI, and most NLP researchers had a very minimal understanding of the engineering undertaking required to train such models or their capabilities & limitations. We started as a ragtag group nobody had heard of, and within a year had released the largest OSS GPT-3-style model in the world.

As access to LLMs has increased, our research has shifted to focus more on interpretability, alignment, ethics, and evaluation of AIs. We look forward to continuing to grow and adapt to the needs of researchers and the public

Today, we are excited to announce the availability of the Cerebras-GPT research paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03208).

A few highlights from this paper:

* **Pre-training Results (Section 3.1)** \- Cerebras-GPT sets the efficiency frontier, largely because models were pre-trained with 20 tokens per parameter, consistent with findings in the Chinchilla paper.

[Pile test set loss given pre-training FLOPs for Cerebras-GPT, GPT-J, GPT-NeoX, and Pythia](https://preview.redd.it/gu0zendb1isa1.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa76446d0d8cd11e0f4be92b90a62f4cb7b73632)

&#x200B;

* **Downstream Results (Section 3.2)** \- Cerebras-GPT models form the compute-optimal Pareto frontier for downstream tasks as well. As Pythia and OPT models grow close to the 20 tokens per parameter count, they approach the Cerebras-GPT frontier FLOPs to accuracy

[Average zero- and five-shot downstream task accuracy plotted against FLOPs \(left\) and parameters \(right\). Higher accuracy is better](https://preview.redd.it/sdnf4w0e1isa1.jpg?width=1450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b246f4413cd2a7cb434aeed9c6a806f156b3b90)

&#x200B;

* **Maximal Update Parameterization (µP) and µTransfer (Section 3.3)** \- As we scaled the Cerebras-GPT models with standard parameterization (SP) along our scaling law, we experienced challenges predicting appropriate hyperparameters, and these models show substantial variance around their common scaling law. Across model sizes, our µP models exhibit an average of 0.43% improved Pile test loss and 1.7% higher average downstream task accuracy compared to our SP models.

I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to run the larger models (e.g. 175B GPT-3 equivalents) on consumer hardware, perhaps by doing a very slow emulation using one or several PCs such that their collective RAM (or swap SDD space) matches the VRAM needed for those beasts.

So the question is ""will it run super slowly"" or ""will it fail immediately due to completely incompatible software / being impossible to configure for anything other than real datacenter hardware""?"

While very simple on the surface, this may actually be very true: what if we are training our language models to be very shallow thinkers and not actually look far enough ahead? Could single token prediction actually be a fundamental flaw?

In this repo, I try a very early experiment called GPT-3T, a model that predicts 3 tokens ahead at one time step. While incredibly simple on the surface, this could potentially be one way to overcome the planning issue that you find in GPTs. Forcing an autoregressive model to predict further ahead at scale *may* bring out much more interesting emergent behaviours than what we’ve seen in single token GPTs.

**Experiments**

My personal experiments are overall inconclusive on either side: I have only pre-trained a very small model (300 million params on WebText-10K) and it achieves a decent ability to generate text. However as you can see, this model heavily under optimized but I do not have the resources to carry this out further.

If anyone would like to try this experiment with more scale, I would love to get an answer to this question to improve upon this model. This repo is intended to allow anyone who would like to pre-train a GPT-3T model easily to run this experiment. From what I have seen, this has not been tried before and I am very curious to see results.

Throughout history, humans have dreamed of robots that could assist them with their daily lives and work. With the emergence of home assistants and OpenAI's Copilot, requests such as 'Please lower the temperature of the air conditioning' or even 'Please help me build an online store' have become possible.The emergence of GPT-4 has further demonstrated the potential of multimodal large models in visual understanding. In the open-source small model space, LLAVA and minigpt-4 have performed well in image recognition and chat, and can even suggest recipes for food images. However, these models still face significant challenges in practical implementation: they lack accurate localization capabilities and cannot provide specific locations of objects in images, nor can they understand complex human instructions to detect specific objects, making it difficult for them to perform specific tasks as requested by humans. In practical scenarios, if people could simply take a photo and ask an intelligent assistant for the correct answer to a complex problem, such a 'take a photo and ask' feature would be incredibly cool.  
To implement the ""**take a photo and ask**"" feature, robots need to have several capabilities:

1. Language understanding: the ability to listen and understand human intentions.
2. Visual understanding: the ability to understand the objects in the image.
3. Common sense reasoning: the ability to convert complex human intentions into precise and locatable targets.
4. Object localization: the ability to locate and detect corresponding objects in the image.

Currently, only a few large models (such as Google's PaLM-E) possess all four of these capabilities. However, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have proposed an open-source model called DetGPT (DetectionGPT), which only needs to fine-tune three million parameters to easily acquire complex reasoning and local object localization capabilities that can be generalized to most scenarios. This means that the model can easily recognize the objects that humans are interested in through self-knowledge reasoning and understand abstract human instructions. They have already developed a ""take a photo and ask"" demo using the model, which can be experienced online: [https://detgpt.github.io/](https://detgpt.github.io/)DetGPT allows users to operate everything with natural language without the need for complex commands or interfaces. In addition, DetGPT has intelligent reasoning and object detection capabilities, which can accurately understand user needs and intentions. For example, if a human gives a language instruction, ""I want to have a cold beverage,"" the robot first searches for a cold drink in the scene but does not find any. It then begins to think, ""There is no visible beverage. Where can I find it?"" Through its powerful common sense reasoning ability, the model realizes that the fridge is a possible location and scans the scene to successfully locate the drink!

## Features of DetGPT

DetGPT has several unique features:

1. It has a significantly improved understanding of specific objects in images. Compared to previous models that use multimodal dialogues, DetGPT can retrieve and locate target objects from images based on the user's instructions, rather than simply describing the entire image.
2. It can understand complex human instructions, which lowers the barrier for users to ask questions. For example, the model can understand the question ""find fruits that can relieve hypertension?"" Traditional object detection requires humans to know the answer and pre-set the detection category, such as ""banana.""
3. DetGPT can use existing LLM knowledge to reason and accurately locate the corresponding object in the image that can solve more complex tasks. For complex tasks, such as ""fruits that can relieve hypertension,"" DetGPT can reason step by step: relieving hypertension -> potassium can relieve hypertension -> bananas are rich in potassium -> bananas can relieve hypertension -> need to identify the object banana.
4. It provides answers beyond human common sense. For some uncommon questions, such as which fruits are rich in potassium, the model can provide answers based on existing knowledge.

## A new direction: reasoning-based object detection

Traditional object detection tasks require pre-defined categories of possible objects for detection. However, providing accurate and comprehensive descriptions of the objects to be detected can be difficult and unrealistic for humans. This is due to the limitations of human memory and knowledge. For instance, a doctor may recommend that people with hypertension eat fruits rich in potassium, but may not know which specific fruits are rich in potassium, making it impossible to provide specific fruit names for the model to detect. If the question ""Identify fruits that can help alleviate hypertension"" could be directly posed to the detection model, humans would only need to take a photo, and the model could think, reason, and detect fruits rich in potassium, making the problem much simpler.Moreover, the examples of object categories provided by humans are not always comprehensive. For instance, if monitoring is required to detect behaviors that violate public order relative to public places, humans may only be able to provide a few simple scenarios, such as holding a knife or smoking. However, if the question ""detect behaviors that violate public order"" is directly posed to the detection model, the model can think and reason based on its own knowledge, thus capturing more unacceptable behaviors and generalizing to more relevant categories that need to be detected. After all, the knowledge that ordinary humans have access to is limited, and the object categories that they can provide examples of are also limited. However, if there is a big brain-like ChatGPT-like model to assist and reason, the instructions that humans need to provide will be much simpler, and the obtained answers will be much more accurate and comprehensive.To address the limitations of human instructions and their abstract nature, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have proposed a new direction called ""reasoning-based object detection."" In simple terms, humans give complex tasks, and the model can understand and reason about which objects in the image might be able to complete the task, and then detect them. For example, if a person describes ""I want to drink a cold drink, where can I find it,"" and the model sees a picture of a kitchen, it can detect the ""refrigerator."" This topic requires the perfect combination of multimodal models' image understanding ability and the rich knowledge stored in language models. It is used in fine-grained detection scenarios to accurately locate objects of interest to humans in images without pre-defined object categories.  


# The Approach

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ho9ux1pcahza1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf42e1baffa2925e8b946b191766ca116aec2fe1

The ""reasoning-based object detection"" is a challenging problem because the detector needs to understand and reason about the user's coarse-grained/abstract instructions and analyze the current visual information to locate the target object accurately. In this direction, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have conducted some preliminary explorations. Specifically, they use a pre-trained visual encoder (BLIP-2) to extract visual features from images and align the visual features to the text space using an alignment function. They use a large-scale language model (Robin/Vicuna) to understand the user's question, combined with the visual information they see, to reason about the objects that users are truly interested in. Then, they provide the object names to the pre-trained detector (Grounding-DINO) for specific location prediction. In this way, the model can analyze the image based on any user instructions and accurately predict the location of the object of interest to the user.  
It is worth noting that the difficulty here mainly lies in the fact that the model needs to achieve task-specific output formats for different specific tasks as much as possible without damaging the model's original abilities. To guide the language model to follow specific patterns and generate outputs that conform to the object detection format, the research team used ChatGPT to generate cross-modal instruction data to fine-tune the model. Specifically, based on 5000 coco images, they used ChatGPT to create a 30,000 cross-modal image-text fine-tuning dataset. To improve the efficiency of training, they fixed other model parameters and only learned cross-modal linear mapping. Experimental results show that even if only the linear layer is fine-tuned, the language model can understand fine-grained image features and follow specific patterns to perform inference-based image detection tasks, showing excellent performance.  
This research topic has great potential. Based on this technology, the field of home robots will further shine: people in homes can use abstract or coarse-grained voice instructions to make robots understand, recognize, and locate the objects they need, and provide relevant services. In the field of industrial robots, this technology will bring endless vitality: industrial robots can cooperate more naturally with human workers, accurately understand their instructions and needs, and achieve intelligent decision-making and operations. On the production line, human workers can use coarse-grained voice instructions or text input to allow robots to automatically understand, recognize, and locate the items that need to be processed, thereby improving production efficiency and quality.  
With object detection models that come with reasoning capabilities, we can develop more intelligent, natural, and efficient robots to provide more convenient, efficient, and humane services to humans. This is a field with broad prospects and deserves more attention and further exploration by more researchers.  
DetGPT supports multiple language models and has been validated based on two language models, Robin-13B and Vicuna-13B. The Robin series language model is a dialogue model trained by the LMFlow team ( https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, achieving results competitive to Vicuna on multiple language ability evaluation benchmarks (model download: [https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow#model-zoo](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow#model-zoo)). Previously, the LMFlow team trained a vertical GPT model using a consumer-grade 3090 graphics card in just 5 hours. Today, this team, in collaboration with the NLP Group at the University of Hong Kong, has brought us a multimodal surprise.

I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

There’s people talking about AGI, the singularity, and etc. I get that it’s cool, exciting, and fun; but some of the talk seems a little much?

Do any of the people making these kind of claims have a decent amount of knowledge on machine learning at all? The scope of my own knowledge is very limited, as I’ve only implemented and taken courses on models that are pretty old. So I’m here to ask for opinions from ya’ll.

This is a massive, massive deal. For context, the reason GPT-3 apps took off over the past few months before ChatGPT went viral is because a) text-davinci-003 was released and was a significant performance increase and b) the cost was cut from $0.06/1k tokens to $0.02/1k tokens, which made consumer applications feasible without a large upfront cost.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

Basically, starting w an open source Meta 7B LLaMa model, they recruited GPT-3.5 to use for self-instruct training (as opposed to RLHF) and were able to produce a model that behaved similar to GPT-3.5. Amazingly, the process only took few weeks and $600 in compute cost.  

Any thoughts on how such low cost to train/deploy LLMs could affect companies like AMD, Nvidia and Intel etc? This seems like new idiom of AI tech and trying to wrap my head around CPU/GPU demand implications given the apparent orders of magnitude training cost reduction.

I.e. 128 GB GPUs exist out there somewhere, but the distributors don't even list a price, it's just ""get a quote"" and ""contact us""... meaning it's super expensive and you need to be a CEO of medium-sized company for them to even talk to you?

I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to run the larger models (e.g. 175B GPT-3 equivalents) on consumer hardware, perhaps by doing a very slow emulation using one or several PCs such that their collective RAM (or swap SDD space) matches the VRAM needed for those beasts.

So the question is ""will it run super slowly"" or ""will it fail immediately due to completely incompatible software / being impossible to configure for anything other than real datacenter hardware""?"

I get to plot a histogram with the numbers and they are close to what I would consider an exponential distribution with such parameter (you can see the plot).

Given that GPT 3.5 does not have access to a Python interpreter, how on earth is it able to do so? I have also tried other distributions and parameters and it kind of works. It's not perfect, but with normal distributions it is usually close to what scipy.stats would generate.

I could understand that it can have learnt to interpret Python code to some extent, but honestly I can't find explanation for random sampling from a probability distribution. For a Normal distribution, I can tell it about the desired mean and variance, and it samples values that are more than reasonable (and close to the true mean/variance specified).

Any thoughts? I honestly am unable to wrap my head around how a LLM can have the understanding on how to sample tokens (at digit level) to fit any probability distribution. To me it seems very unlikely to have similar data either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages."

[video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

I did a quick experiment with Pytorch 2.0 Native scaled\_dot\_product\_attention. I was able to a single forward pass within 9GB of memory which is astounding. I think by patching existing Pretrained GPT models and adding more positional encodings, one could easily fine-tune those models to 32k attention on a single A100 80GB. Here is the code I used:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6csxe28lv9oa1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff8b48a77f49fab7d088fd8ba220f720860249bc

I think it should be possible to replicate even GPT-4 with open source tools something like Bloom + FlashAttention & fine-tune on 32k tokens.

**Update**: I was successfully able to start the training of GPT-2 (125M) with a context size of 8k and batch size of 1 on a 16GB GPU. Since memory scaled linearly from 4k to 8k. I am expecting, 32k would require \~64GB and should train smoothly on A100 80 GB. Also, I did not do any other optimizations. Maybe 8-bit fine-tuning can further optimize it.

**Update 2**: I basically picked Karpaty's nanoGPT and patched the pretrained GPT-2 by repeating the embeddings N-times. I was unable to train the model at 8k because generation would cause the crash.  So I started the training for a context window of 4k on The Pile: 1 hour in and loss seems to be going down pretty fast. Also Karpaty's generate function is super inefficient, O(n\^4) I think so it took forever to generate even 2k tokens. So I generate 1100 tokens just to see if the model is able to go beyond 1k limit. And it seems to be working. [Here are some samples](https://0bin.net/paste/O-+eopaW#nmtzX1Re7f1Nr-Otz606jkltvKk/kUXY96/8ca+tb4f) at 3k iteration.

**Update 3**: I have started the training and I am publishing the training script if anyone is interested in replicating or building upon this work. Here is the complete training script:

[https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c](https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c)

I will post an update after the weekend once the training has progressed somewhat.

**Post-Weekend Update**: After \~50k iterations (the model has seen \~200 million tokens, I know this is just too small compared to 10s of billions trained by giga corps), loss only dropped from 4.6 to 4.2 on The Pile:

https://preview.redd.it/vi0fpskhsuoa1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fccc5277d91a6400adc6d968b0f2f0ff0da2afc

AFAIR, the loss of GPT-2 on the Pile if trained with 1024 tokens is \~2.8. It seems like the size of the dimension for each token is kind of limiting how much loss can go down since GPT-2 (small) has an embedding dimension of 768. Maybe someone can experiment with GPT-2 medium etc. to see how much we can improve.

From my personal experience, the quality of the model depends a lot on the fine-tuning data as opposed to just the sheer size.

The future of LLMs might look more open-source than imagined 3 months back?

These are my discoveries after ~100 hours of extensive experimentation and ways I think it can be improved.,NepNep_,False,0.9,308,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12pqqg6/discussion_translation_of_japanese_to_english/,62,1681754083.0,"Hello. I am currently experimenting with the viability of LLM models for Japanese to English translation. I've been experimenting with GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 utilizing the DAN protocols, and GPT 4 for this project for around 3 months now with very promising results and I think I've identified several limitations with GPT that if addressed can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of translations.

&#x200B;

The project I'm working on is attempting to translate a light novel series from japanese to english. During these tests I did a deep dive, asking GPT how it is attempting the translations and asking it to modify its translation methodology through various means (I am considering doing a long video outlining all this and showing off the prompts and responses at a later date). Notably this includes asking it to utilize its understanding of the series its translating from its training knowledge to aide in the translation, and providing it with a ""seed"" translation. Basically the seed is a side by side japanese and english translation to show GPT what I'm looking for in terms of grammar and formatting. The english translation notably is a human translation, not a machine translation. The results from these tests provided SIGNIFICANT improvements to the final translation, so significant in fact that a large portion of the text could reasonably be assumed to be human-translated.

&#x200B;

Link to the project I'm working on so you can see my documentation and results: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT\_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

I've probably done around 50-100 hours of extensive testing with translation and methodology over the past 2-3 months. Over that time I've discovered the following:

1. Both GPT3 and GPT4 are significant improvements over traditional translation services such as google or deepl. This may be because Japanese and English are very different languages in how they are written and how their grammar works so prior translation services simply did a direct translation while GPT is capable of understanding the text and rewriting it to account for that. For example in japanese, there are no pronouns like ""he"" and ""her"" so a person's gender might not be clear from the sentence alone. Google Translate and DeepL typically just take a 50/50 guess, while GPT from my experience has been much more capable in getting this right based on understanding the larger context from the paragraph.
2. GPT has a tendency to censor text deliberately if it feels the translation may offend people. This isn't just for things that are blatantly offensive like slurs, it also includes mild sexual content, the kind that is typically approved for teen viewing/reading. The biggest problem is that it doesn't tell you it is censoring anything unless you ask it, meaning everything else may be a solid translation yet it may censor information which can ultimately hurt the translation, especially for story related translations like in my tests. These restrictions can be bypassed with correct prompting. I've had luck using GPT 3's DAN protocols however DAN's translations arent as strong as GPT 4, and I've had luck with GPT 4 by framing the translation as a game with extreme win and loss conditions and telling it that if it censors the translation, it may offend the author of the content since people in japan hold different values from our own.
3. GPT puts too high a focus on accuracy even if instructed not to. This is a good thing to a degree since outside of censorship you know the translation is accurate, however even when explicitly told to put maximum emphasis on readability, even if it hurts the accuracy, and it is allowed to rewrite sentences from the ground up to aide readability, it still puts too strong an emphasis on accuracy. I have determined this through testing that for some reason it is ignoring the request to focus on readability and will still maximize accuracy. The best way I've found to fix this issue is through demonstration, specifically the ""seed"" I mentioned earlier. By giving it a japanese and english translation of the same work but earlier in the story, it then understands how to put more emphasis on readability. The results is something that is 95% within the range of accuracy a professional translator would use while much easier to read.
4. GPT's biggest limitation is the fact that it ""forgets"" the seed way too quickly, usually within a few prompts. I've done testing with its data retention and it appears that if you give it too much information to remember at once it slowly bugs out. With GPT 3 its a hard crash type bug where it just spews nonsense unrelated to your request, however GPT 4 can remember a lot more information and will hard crash if you give it too much info but otherwise builds up errors slowly as you give it more info. I initially believed that there were issues with the token count, but further testing shows that the GPT model simply isn't optimized for this method of translation and a new or reworked model that you can give a seed and it will remember it longer would be better. The seed is one of the best tools for improving its performance

Next steps:

I would like to try to either create my own model or modify an existing one to optimize it for translation. If any1 knows any tools or guides I'd appreciate it."

> “GPT-4 cannot plan, but this might be a limitation because it can only look one token into the future”

While very simple on the surface, this may actually be very true: what if we are training our language models to be very shallow thinkers and not actually look far enough ahead? Could single token prediction actually be a fundamental flaw?

In this repo, I try a very early experiment called GPT-3T, a model that predicts 3 tokens ahead at one time step. While incredibly simple on the surface, this could potentially be one way to overcome the planning issue that you find in GPTs. Forcing an autoregressive model to predict further ahead at scale *may* bring out much more interesting emergent behaviours than what we’ve seen in single token GPTs.

My personal experiments are overall inconclusive on either side: I have only pre-trained a very small model (300 million params on WebText-10K) and it achieves a decent ability to generate text. However as you can see, this model heavily under optimized but I do not have the resources to carry this out further.

If anyone would like to try this experiment with more scale, I would love to get an answer to this question to improve upon this model. This repo is intended to allow anyone who would like to pre-train a GPT-3T model easily to run this experiment. From what I have seen, this has not been tried before and I am very curious to see results.

GPT-4 has shown significant improvement over GPT-3 in terms of playing chess, with what I estimate to be a ELO rating of around 1000 now. While this is impressive, it is still nowhere near the performance level of Stockfish. This has led me to ponder the following question:

How many years do you think it will take for a GPT-like model (not specifically or even intentionally trained for chess) to surpass Stockfish in terms of chess-playing abilities?"

**Live demo:** [**https://www.glaciermd.com/search**](https://www.glaciermd.com/search?utm_campaign=reddit_post_1)

**Background**

I've been working for a while on building a better version of WebMD, and I recently started playing around with LLMs, trying to figure out if there was anything useful there.

The problem with the current batch of ""predict-next-token"" LLMs is that they hallucinate—you can ask ChatGPT to answer medical questions, but it'll either

1. Refuse to answer (not great)
2. Give a completely false answer (really super bad)

So I spent some time trying to coax these LLMs to give answers based on a very specific set of inputs (peer-reviewed medical research) to see if I could get more accurate answers. And I did!

The best part is you can actually trace the final answer back to the original sources, which will hopefully instill some confidence in the result.

Here's how it works:

1. User types in a question
2. Pull top \~800 studies from Semantic Scholar and Pubmed
3. Re-rank using `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`
4. Ask `text-davinci-003` to answer the question based on the top 10 studies (if possible)
5. Summarize those answers using `text-davinci-003`

Would love to hear what people think (and if there's a better/cheaper way to do it!).

Today, we are excited to announce the availability of the Cerebras-GPT research paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03208).

A few highlights from this paper:

* **Pre-training Results (Section 3.1)** \- Cerebras-GPT sets the efficiency frontier, largely because models were pre-trained with 20 tokens per parameter, consistent with findings in the Chinchilla paper.

[Pile test set loss given pre-training FLOPs for Cerebras-GPT, GPT-J, GPT-NeoX, and Pythia](https://preview.redd.it/gu0zendb1isa1.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa76446d0d8cd11e0f4be92b90a62f4cb7b73632)

&#x200B;

* **Downstream Results (Section 3.2)** \- Cerebras-GPT models form the compute-optimal Pareto frontier for downstream tasks as well. As Pythia and OPT models grow close to the 20 tokens per parameter count, they approach the Cerebras-GPT frontier FLOPs to accuracy

[Average zero- and five-shot downstream task accuracy plotted against FLOPs \(left\) and parameters \(right\). Higher accuracy is better](https://preview.redd.it/sdnf4w0e1isa1.jpg?width=1450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b246f4413cd2a7cb434aeed9c6a806f156b3b90)

&#x200B;

* **Maximal Update Parameterization (µP) and µTransfer (Section 3.3)** \- As we scaled the Cerebras-GPT models with standard parameterization (SP) along our scaling law, we experienced challenges predicting appropriate hyperparameters, and these models show substantial variance around their common scaling law. Across model sizes, our µP models exhibit an average of 0.43% improved Pile test loss and 1.7% higher average downstream task accuracy compared to our SP models. Here, we also show that µP performance scales more predictably, enabling more accurate performance extrapolation.

We appreciate the candid feedback and look forward to hearing any additional feedback you have on our research.

**Note**: Thank you r/MachineLearning for providing so many awesome naming alternatives! We'll revisit the acronym and update accordingly.

We are excited to announce the availability of our [paper on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11525) on Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations (Sparse-IFT), which increases accuracy and maintains the same FLOPs as the dense model using sparsity. In this research, we replace dense layers with Sparse-IFT and significantly improve computer vision and natural language processing tasks without modifying training hyperparameters

Some of the highlights of this work include ResNet-18 on ImageNet achieving a 3.5% accuracy improvement and GPT-3 Small on WikiText-103 reducing perplexity by 0.4, both matching larger dense model variants that have 2x or more FLOPs.

Sparse-IFT is simple to use, provides a larger search space to find optimal sparse masks, and is parameterized by a single hyperparameter - the sparsity level.

This is independent of the research we [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11xskuk/r_spdf_sparse_pretraining_and_dense_finetuning/) yesterday, which demonstrates the ability to reduce pre-training FLOPs while maintaining accuracy on downstream tasks.

This is the first work (that we know of!) to demonstrate the use of sparsity for improving the accuracy of models via a set of sparse transformations.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

Abstract:

>Existing language models (LMs) predict tokens with a softmax over a finite vocabulary, which can make it difficult to predict rare tokens or phrases. We introduce **NPM**, the first **nonparametric masked language model** that **replaces this softmax with a nonparametric distribution over every phrase in a reference corpus**. We show that NPM can be efficiently trained with a contrastive objective and an in-batch approximation to full corpus retrieval. Zero-shot evaluation on 9 closed-set tasks and 7 open-set tasks demonstrates that **NPM outperforms significantly larger parametric models, either with or without a retrieve-and-generate approach**. It is particularly **better on dealing with rare patterns (word senses or facts),** and **predicting rare or nearly unseen words (e.g., non-Latin script)**.
