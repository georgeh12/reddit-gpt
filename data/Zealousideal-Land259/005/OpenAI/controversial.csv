Im trying to make a chat gpt driven app, and i looked at what would happen if i scaled up. Im currently using $.02 daily, which is a fair estimate. Now, running those numbers up,

Hundreds (e.g., 100 users):
Daily cost: 100 users * $0.02/user = $2

Monthly cost: $2/day * 30 days = $60

Annual cost: $60/month * 12 months = $720


Thousands (e.g., 1,000 users):

Daily cost: 1,000 users * $0.02/user = $20

Monthly cost: $20/day * 30 days = $600

Annual cost: $600/month * 12 months = $7,200


Tens of Thousands (e.g., 10,000 users):

Daily cost: 10,000 users * $0.02/user = $200

Monthly cost: $200/day * 30 days = $6,000

Annual cost: $6,000/month * 12 months = $72,000

How the hell can any startup afford this?? These prices feel exorbitant. And trust me, im trying to minmax my token usage as much as i can here, but it hurts when you get charged for tokens sent, returned, in chat history and system prompt.

Idk, whats yall’s opinion? Has anyone made a gpt app that didnt break the bank?

Edit: just woke up, ouch my karma

Edit 2: seeing alot of comments asking my business plan, im not trying to out myself here but generally speaking i expect the service to be something like the following:

-users would pay a one time fee to access the app for a period of time, typically a few months. Chats are also rate limited to 15/3 hours

There was one pretty helpful comment out there pointing out that simply charging users the equivalent of $.04 a day would solve alot of issues, and honestly I agree so shoutout to that guy wherever he is.

Apparently 70k is considered normal for VC funding, which is nuts to me. I ran a firebase app for a year with about 100 active users and spent $.12 on bandwidth, so the jump is jarring. 

Im still standing by my statement. Lower level startups will get gate kept by this pricing, leaving only the giants to monopolize it. Our only hope is for PALM to have better pricing or wizardLM to catch up."

The decision to keep the code private is not only detrimental to the progress of the field, but it is also highly suspect from an ethical standpoint. It is not enough for OpenAI to simply assert that the code is being kept private for the sake of national security; the organization has a responsibility to provide the broader AI community with a clear and compelling justification for this decision.

In short, the decision to keep the ChatGPT source code private is a deeply misguided one that runs counter to the principles of collaboration, transparency, and ethical responsibility that should guide the development of artificial intelligence.

I found a glaring hole in our water use.   In fact, California is allowing companies to essentially export water for profit and it’s a lot of water.

According to data in ChatGPT, agriculture is by far the biggest user of water in California.   Citizens use a small percentage, around 3%, of all the water in California.   Within agriculture, alfalfa is the number one crop based on how much water is used to grow it.   It’s a water hog.   Alfalfa is used primarily for food for livestock.  That’s important for our food supply.

The gotcha is this, a significant portion of California alfalfa crop is exported to other countries.  Mostly across the Pacific to Asia.   So how much water would California save if businesses stopped exporting California alfalfa to other countries?

Enough water for 10 million citizens for a year.    That’s the entire population of the San Francisco Bay Area and the greater San Diego area combined.   Annually.

And the insult is that the farms raising the exported alfalfa could instead replace them with different crops that use less water and produce higher revenue.

Is this true?   Seems to be but I haven’t verified the numbers.

Ask ChatGPT yourself and see what you learn."

But if you think that way, you are missing the consequences of probably millions of people who are capable and active, but have no value to modern society.  


Second, I don't see anything positive outcome for humanity. It's not going to stop inflation, it's not going to bring down energy prices, it's not going to create cheap food, and so on.  


I'm not saying that we should climb back up the tree.  I think we should think carefully before building another ""nuclear bomb"" without knowing about the ""radiation"".  I think in the worst case, AI can cause an event where 1% of society survives, the rest either solve their problems and live like animals, or die.
