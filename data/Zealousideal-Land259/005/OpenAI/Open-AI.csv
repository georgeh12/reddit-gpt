Last week, I randomly discovered OpenAI Playground, and this is my experience:

At first, I was not sure what it was all about, but when I finally understood how to use it and how to ""correctly"" ask certain questions, the results it generated, was interesting.

To put it up for a true test, I gave it some data about an extremely complex ICU-patient. I gave it information about the patients gender, age, weight, and a short summary of that persons anamnesis. I further gave it information about the ventilators settings (percentage of oxygen, flow, PEEP etc), and a list of medicine. Based on all the data given, I asked it to create an opinion on the treatment, what the outcome could look like, what we should be aware of, and eventually a suggestion on what to do next. I gave it one question at a time, but based on the same data.

The results it generated, were overwhelming. I literally started to cry, realizing how that very moment could change our lives forever. It was a truly life changing experience. It generated beautiful text, easy to understand and completely up to date with our latest protocols and knowledge within our medical field. The treatment strategy it generated was like taken straight out of my senior physicians notes. This machine did not come up with a standard protocol for a typical patient in a similar situation. It literally decided on the different variables, and made a treatment plan based on it.

I was thinking about how useful this can be as a tool for doctors, physicians, nurses, physical therapists, and the list goes on and on. This technology will help us make more precise diagnosis, and suggest the best treatment strategy based on what information and data we provide it. This technology will save lives and optimize/increase the patients outcome and quality of life after a longer stay at hospitals. And this again will save money. It is a win win situation, if used correctly. A true game changer.

I do not believe AI will make us more stupid. This has done the complete opposite for me. It has expanded my brain and given me new ideas. It has helped me to understand things in more simple ways, things that I have spent years trying to wrap my brain around.

I am still shaking a bit after my experience with OpenAI Playground. And this is only the start. Imagine what it can do for us in 5 years. As a future doctor who wants to specialize in ICU and trauma, this tool is very welcome.

I want to be able to search for information by asking ChatGPT to read through the entire corpus and locating that information for me.

Some challenges I see are:

1. ChatGPT / GPT4 have a character limit
2. Prompt splitting could work, but I worry that ChatGPT may not have enough memory to remember very early information that could provide the necessary context for later information downstream.
3. It is expensive and time consuming to go through each section one by one after text splitting.

Is there an intelligent way to achieve this with efficiency and scale? Perhaps one way is to use an in-house cheaper and faster LLM to do rough searching and bubble up candidates, and then ask ChatGPT to do the last mile?

The steps are (can be supported via LangChain framework):

1.	Turn the document into embeddings (maybe using Ada)

2.	Store those embeddings in a vector db (like pinecone)

3.	When user makes a question, use Ada to turn their question into embeddings

4.	Use those embeddings to search the vector db (via cosine similarity)

5.	Return all the relevant strings from the vector db

6.	Construct a prompt gpt 3-4 to answer the original user question using info contained in the returned strings from the vector db

7.	Send result to user

Now here we are a week later and there’s a code red, Sundar Pichai redirects some teams to focus on building out AI products and Google are scared ChatGPT will make them obsolete.

One week: WE ARE FINE  
Next Week: we are NOT fine!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google's parent company, Alphabet, participated in several meetings around Google's AI strategy and has directed numerous groups in the company to refocus their efforts on addressing the threat that ChatGPT poses on its search engine business, according to an internal memo and audio recording reviewed by the Times.

In particular, teams in Google's research, Trust, and Safety division among other departments have been directed to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of new AI prototypes and products, the Times reported. Some employees have even been tasked to build AI products that generate art and graphics similar to OpenAI's DALL-E used by millions of people, according to the Times.

On one hand, this is great cause it means, AI innovation will move a lot faster cause of the competition ( capitalism at its finest)

But on the other hand, from a privacy standpoint, google will definitely not be holding back, they have more than enough data on us to train an AI FAST! so yeah we should expect some “Changes in policy”

Also not Google copying the Facebook (sorry Meta) model of Copying the startup, lmao

One week: WE ARE FINE  
Next Week: we are NOT fine!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google's parent company, Alphabet, participated in several meetings around Google's AI strategy and has directed numerous groups in the company to refocus their efforts on addressing the threat that ChatGPT poses on its search engine business, according to an internal memo and audio recording reviewed by the Times.

In particular, teams in Google's research, Trust, and Safety division among other departments have been directed to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of new AI prototypes and products, the Times reported. Some employees have even been tasked to build AI products that generate art and graphics similar to OpenAI's DALL-E used by millions of people, according to the Times.

On one hand, this is great cause it means, AI innovation will move a lot faster cause of the competition ( capitalism at its finest)

But on the other hand, from a privacy standpoint, google will definitely not be holding back, they have more than enough data on us to train an AI FAST! so yeah we should expect some “Changes in policy”

Also not Google copying the Facebook (sorry Meta) model of Copying the startup, lmao

About a week ago, you could role-play with ChatGPT and get it to say some pretty funny and interesting things. Now that the OpenAI team has patched this, people will find a new way to explore the ability of ChatGPT, does that mean they’ll patch that too?

In as much as we understand that there are bad actors, limiting the ability of ChatGPT is probably not the best way to propagate the safe use of AI. How long do we have before the whole lore of ChatGPT is patched and we just have a basic chatbot?

What do you think is the best way to both develop AI and Keep it safe?

I want to be able to search for information by asking ChatGPT to read through the entire corpus and locating that information for me.

Some challenges I see are:

1. ChatGPT / GPT4 have a character limit
2. Prompt splitting could work, but I worry that ChatGPT may not have enough memory to remember very early information that could provide the necessary context for later information downstream.
3. It is expensive and time consuming to go through each section one by one after text splitting.

Is there an intelligent way to achieve this with efficiency and scale? Perhaps one way is to use an in-house cheaper and faster LLM to do rough searching and bubble up candidates, and then ask ChatGPT to do the last mile?

The steps are (can be supported via LangChain framework):

1.	Turn the document into embeddings (maybe using Ada)

2.	Store those embeddings in a vector db (like pinecone)

3.	When user makes a question, use Ada to turn their question into embeddings

4.	Use those embeddings to search the vector db (via cosine similarity)

5.	Return all the relevant strings from the vector db

6.	Construct a prompt gpt 3-4 to answer the original user question using info contained in the returned strings from the vector db

7.	Send result to user

Many people now face the risk of losing their jobs to AI-powered automation, which raises important questions about the future of work and financial security.

With this in mind, is it time to seriously consider the concept of a universal basic income (UBI) or citizen's salary as a potential solution? A UBI would guarantee a minimum income for every individual, regardless of their employment status, which could alleviate financial stress and promote a more equitable society.

Some proponents argue that a UBI could foster a sense of freedom and creativity, allowing people to pursue their passions and contribute to society in more meaningful ways. Critics, on the other hand, contend that it could lead to a lack of motivation and discourage people from seeking work.

As we continue to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of AI and automation, it's crucial that we engage in thoughtful discussions about the merits and drawbacks of a UBI. This debate is more relevant than ever, as it will help us determine the best course of action to secure a prosperous future for all.

Let's open up the conversation: What are your thoughts on the implementation of a universal basic income in response to AI-driven job displacement?"

The watermark-like security feature could help teachers and academics spot students who are using text generators such as OpenAI’s GPT to write essays for them, but cryptography experts say workarounds will inevitably be found.

It almost seems that there’s a new GPT-driven paradigm shift almost every day now, and that people continue to find new and amazing applications for large language models, but they are not without limitations. When it comes to article writing, ChatGPT tends to spit out generic sounding articles that no human with a working cortex would enjoy reading, or find much value in them. However, giving it an article as an input and asking it to re-write it and focus on a certain angle or perspective, will produce really good results!

And that’s the core idea behind this little tool I made. With it, you can scrape entire blogs or knowledgebases and programmatically give each article to chatGPT to re-write.

The beauty is that you can tell ChatGPT to focus on a certain angle, or re-write the entire article from a a different perspective. You can also tell it to focus on certain keywords, and the end result will be a high quality, SEO-optimised unique piece of content.

You can generate hundreds of articles like this and all you need is an OpenAI API key and to run the script on your machine.

If this sounds like something that's helpful to you, here is the [Github repository](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/seo-gpt) for it that should contain all the instructions on how to get it set up and running.

The watermark uses a cryptographic pseudorandom function to add an unnoticeable signal to the text.

Look crypto bros, **CRYPTOgraphy** lets spam Twitter with this as a Use case (sarcasm)

In basic terms: Open AI is adding a watermark to text generated from GPT, so it's easier to spot AI-generated works.

The watermark-like security feature could help teachers and academics spot students who are using text generators such as OpenAI’s GPT to write essays for them, but cryptography experts say workarounds will inevitably be found.

*not AI toying with students’ emotions 😭*

But on a more serious note, it's inevitable that a workaround will be created, this one should also be a nice battle between AI developers and People who want to use uncredited work ( I think they are called pirates??? i don’t know).

What do you think about this?

Hmmm. I wonder if the 'obvious' part is that Microsoft invested billions of dollars and doesn't want Google to immediately beat them at their own game the way they have in browsers, OS and search in the past?"
