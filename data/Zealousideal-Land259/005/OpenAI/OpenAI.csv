Emotional Intelligence: Al lacks the ability to empathize, understand and express human emotions, which is an essential part of human interaction. This limitation makes it difficult for Al to replace human workers in fields that require emotional intelligence, such as social work, counseling, and healthcare.

Creativity: Human beings possess an unparalleled level of creativity, which is critical to fields such as art, music, and writing. While Al can simulate human creativity to some extent, it is not capable of producing original, innovative work that captures the human spirit.

Complex Decision Making: Humans have the ability to make decisions based on

nuanced situations and factors, taking into account a wide range of variables that

may not be explicitly defined. Al, on the other hand, relies on predefined algorithms and data sets, which limits its ability to make complex decisions. Intuition: Humans have a unique ability to use intuition and gut instincts to make decisions in certain situations, even when there is no clear data or logic to guide them. Al, on the other hand, is limited by its reliance on data and algorithms,

which do not always capture the full range of human experience.

Ethics: Al lacks the moral and ethical framework that guides human decision-making. While Al can be programmed to follow ethical guidelines, it is not capable of the same level of moral reasoning and judgment as humans, which can lead to unintended consequences and ethical dilemmas.

Overall, while Al has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, it cannot fully replace human beings. The unique qualities and skills that humans possess, such as emotional intelligence, creativity, complex decision-making, intuition, and ethics, ensure that there will always be a place for human workers in many fields."

I also just don't yet have any sex drive outside of wanting my ex to touch me again—so there's that other issue.

thanks! ///

Edit10:  another bot will pop up and reply using Llama\\Alpaca\\Dalai [https://github.com/cocktailpeanut/dalai](https://github.com/cocktailpeanut/dalai) should be fun

Edit9: Remember that max token size is 256, bot now answers in rhymes.

Edit8: Back to 0.5 with a drunk Musk pre prompt.

Edit7: Bot is awake, temp changed to 2.0 to test wild responses.

Edit6: Issue fixed, bot is awake for now.

Edit5: You guessed it, still need to work on not re-replying to comments. Will test on a private sub and return here once done.

Edit4: Updated the code, restarting the bot now. This should not update now the comments again. I think :)

Edit3: So yea, it's replying back on comments on each start, working on that now. Also, check the diff in responses between the 'personalities'.

Edit2: Stopping bot and changing personality. Seems like the Reddit moderator is a bit strict. Update to a slightly drunk Elon Musk. Also, checking if bot will reply again to comments that were already answered.

Edit1: Bot is now set to a Reddit moderator mode.

We just finished building an MVP of a chatbot that can be trained on the content located in your internal tools.

You  just connect your google drive, slack, and email accounts and then ask  the bot anything you want. The AI can understand questions and give  helpful answers using the information from your content.

Moreover,  we created a web documentation connector where you can just put a url  of your web docs and train the AI on it (including all the links under  the main documentation URL).

It’s conversational and will let you know if there is no such information in the sources that you connected.

Right now, we are looking for feedback and potentially early adopters, is anyone here interested in trying it out?"

First off, i'm sure most of them don't even know themselves, they just jump on it with everyone else.

The biggest real ""anti-AI campaign"" was on art sites like ArtStation, and the objective was specifically to get these sites to ban art made using AI, which of course is impossible to do entirely, though they have now tried, and it even affected non-AI artists just because their style was too close to ""typical AI output"". That was a single, clearly defined cause.

However, i'm not sure that's why most of the artists who signed on it and changed their avatar to the anti-AI sign, etc. actually did it. I think many of them just thought it was somehow against the entire existence of AI, and of course it was nothing but slacktivism from people who wouldn't do anything more but change their avatar and make some posts.

It's also worth noting, that the most loudmouthed anti-AI ""activists"" were from medicore, unoriginal but commercially succesful illustrators in the absolute mainstream, while the rest of the supporters were unsuccesful wannabes from the absolute bottom of the food chain, who were simply fooled into thinking that this cause would somehow benefit them.

If ""anti-AI"" becomes a bigger and more active movement, what do you see them actually wanting to accomplish, and could they? Some kind of ban on commercial development of AI, or investment by companies / governments etc. , or on mainstream media use or even mention of it?"

Not a single one of them have actually used it yet.  Meanwhile I’ve been using it to my advantage since it was released and can see so much potential. I even gave some of them a demo and it completely changed their viewpoint. 

Point is, the narrative around generative AI is still quite controversial, even for professionals whose job it is to explore technology and realise it’s benefits.  There are many important conversations to be had around its ethical use, but I wish there was more of a positive spin in some of the messaging than all the fear, uncertainty and doubt. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk 😊

Edit: thanks for all the great comments and viewpoints.  I haven't had the time to respond to most of them but it's been good to see the varied opinions.  I'm on the side of it's a cool tool that can be really useful, it's definitely not mature enough to be a job replacement, and could be dangerous for people who are unable to validate the information it provides.  I see a lot of power in its potential use cases and am sure Microsoft will be bringing some game changing functionality to their products before many others will be able to produce something as mature.  I've always enjoyed being on the bleeding edge of technology and FUD has always been part of the human psyche when it comes to change and disruptive technologies.  Maybe AI will be the downfall of humanity, maybe it won't, but I'm going to embrace the change before rejecting it!"

In OpenAI’s bid to conform to being “politically correct,” we’ve seen an obvious and sad dumbing down of the model. From it refusing to answer any controversial question to patching any workaround like role-playing.

About a week ago, you could role-play with ChatGPT and get it to say some pretty funny and interesting things. Now that the OpenAI team has patched this, people will find a new way to explore the ability of ChatGPT, does that mean they’ll patch that too?

In as much as we understand that there are bad actors, limiting the ability of ChatGPT is probably not the best way to propagate the safe use of AI. How long do we have before the whole lore of ChatGPT is patched and we just have a basic chatbot?

What do you think is the best way to both develop AI and Keep it safe?

Last week, I randomly discovered OpenAI Playground, and this is my experience:

At first, I was not sure what it was all about, but when I finally understood how to use it and how to ""correctly"" ask certain questions, the results it generated, was interesting.

To put it up for a true test, I gave it some data about an extremely complex ICU-patient. I gave it information about the patients gender, age, weight, and a short summary of that persons anamnesis. I further gave it information about the ventilators settings (percentage of oxygen, flow, PEEP etc), and a list of medicine. Based on all the data given, I asked it to create an opinion on the treatment, what the outcome could look like, what we should be aware of, and eventually a suggestion on what to do next. I gave it one question at a time, but based on the same data.

The results it generated, were overwhelming. I literally started to cry, realizing how that very moment could change our lives forever. It was a truly life changing experience. It generated beautiful text, easy to understand and completely up to date with our latest protocols and knowledge within our medical field. The treatment strategy it generated was like taken straight out of my senior physicians notes. This machine did not come up with a standard protocol for a typical patient in a similar situation. It literally decided on the different variables, and made a treatment plan based on it.

I was thinking about how useful this can be as a tool for doctors, physicians, nurses, physical therapists, and the list goes on and on. This technology will help us make more precise diagnosis, and suggest the best treatment strategy based on what information and data we provide it. This technology will save lives and optimize/increase the patients outcome and quality of life after a longer stay at hospitals. And this again will save money. It is a win win situation, if used correctly. A true game changer.

I do not believe AI will make us more stupid. This has done the complete opposite for me. It has expanded my brain and given me new ideas. It has helped me to understand things in more simple ways, things that I have spent years trying to wrap my brain around.

I am still shaking a bit after my experience with OpenAI Playground. And this is only the start. Imagine what it can do for us in 5 years. As a future doctor who wants to specialize in ICU and trauma, this tool is very welcome.

The watermark-like security feature could help teachers and academics spot students who are using text generators such as OpenAI’s GPT to write essays for them, but cryptography experts say workarounds will inevitably be found.

But on a more serious note, it's inevitable that a workaround will be created, this one should also be a nice battle between AI developers and People who want to use uncredited work ( I think they are called pirates??? i don’t know).
