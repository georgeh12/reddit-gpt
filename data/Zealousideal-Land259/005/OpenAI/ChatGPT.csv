Emotional Intelligence: Al lacks the ability to empathize, understand and express human emotions, which is an essential part of human interaction. This limitation makes it difficult for Al to replace human workers in fields that require emotional intelligence, such as social work, counseling, and healthcare.

Creativity: Human beings possess an unparalleled level of creativity, which is critical to fields such as art, music, and writing. While Al can simulate human creativity to some extent, it is not capable of producing original, innovative work that captures the human spirit.

Complex Decision Making: Humans have the ability to make decisions based on

nuanced situations and factors, taking into account a wide range of variables that

may not be explicitly defined. Al, on the other hand, relies on predefined algorithms and data sets, which limits its ability to make complex decisions. Intuition: Humans have a unique ability to use intuition and gut instincts to make decisions in certain situations, even when there is no clear data or logic to guide them. Al, on the other hand, is limited by its reliance on data and algorithms,

which do not always capture the full range of human experience.

Ethics: Al lacks the moral and ethical framework that guides human decision-making. While Al can be programmed to follow ethical guidelines, it is not capable of the same level of moral reasoning and judgment as humans, which can lead to unintended consequences and ethical dilemmas.

Overall, while Al has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, it cannot fully replace human beings. The unique qualities and skills that humans possess, such as emotional intelligence, creativity, complex decision-making, intuition, and ethics, ensure that there will always be a place for human workers in many fields."

I wanted to try GPTZero because I was hearing a lot about it and admit I use ChatGPT to help me certain things, but did not need it for this assignment as it was straightforward and I did not have any struggles with the assignment. To my surprise, my whole paragraph was flagged and likely to be written by AI. To find what section of my paragraph was flagged, I took about every 3 lengthy sentences and put them into the detector. Nothing showed up until a section consisting 3 sentences with about 60 words was flagged as AI. I was shocked to see if that I removed those 3 sentences consisting of 60 words out of 400, my entire paragraph then was given ""written by human"" by the detector. Just these 3 sentences made it so my whole paragraph was flagged as written by AI! That is insanity!!! Next thing I did was try to fix those 3 sentences so they would not get flagged by the AI. I kept revising to sound as ""human"" as I could, but then I decided to remove one word, (which was ""intensifies"") and those sentences got fully cleared by the AI. I inserted them back in and my whole paragraph was cleared as human by the detector. This is absolutely crazy and in conclusion, these detectors could be used just for general checking, but when it comes for grades and work related things where it really matters, they should not be used as they could be massively incorrect as in what I just showed you.

If used properly, it can help you 10x your productivity and income. To remain competitive in this new world, there is simply no option but to learn how to use ChatGPT and other AI tools.   


## 1. Give ChatGPT an identity

In the “real” world, when you seek advice, you look for experts in that field. You go to a trained investment specialist for financial advice and a personal trainer to get into shape. You wouldn’t ask a management consultant for the best way to treat the weird rash on your leg.  


some examples,  
 

* **You want ChatGPT to write sales copy:** “You are a professional copywriter. You have been providing copywriting services to businesses for 20 years. You specialize in writing copy for businesses in the finance sector.”
* **You want career advice:** “You are a professional career advisor. You have been helping young men (20-30) find their dream jobs for 20 years.”  


## 2. Define your objective

When ChatGPT knows what you want, its advice is much more catered to your needs. Simply tell ChatGPT what you are trying to achieve, and it will tailor its responses accordingly. Be as specific as possible about what your objective is.

&#x200B;

for example,  


 When we tell ChatGPT that the goal is to find subscribers for a newsletter, it makes the Tweet much more specific to the benefits of learning how to use ChatGPT. This kind of Tweet is significantly more likely to help us achieve our objective of converting people into newsletter subscribers. 

&#x200B;

## 3. Add constraints to your prompt

You can guide ChatGPT’s output by providing more details about what its answer should or should not be. Constraints help ChatGPT to understand what you are looking for and avoid irrelevant outputs. 

Here are some examples:  
 

* **Specify the length of the response:** “Generate a 200-word summary of this news article.”
* **Specify the format of the response:** “Generate a table of keywords for a blog relating to gardening. Include “Example of article titles” and “target audience” as columns.”

&#x200B;

## 4. Give ChatGPT a structure to follow

In copywriting and storytelling, there are tricks of the trade that all writers use to create persuasive and/or engaging content. Take advantage of this by asking ChatGPT to use these proven methods when completing a task.

&#x200B;

## 5. Refine the output through conversation

The beauty of ChatGPT is that it remembers the whole conversation within each chat. You can ask follow-up questions to dial down into a specific answer.

 

Here are a bunch of useful follow-up prompts you can use to refine your ChatGPT answers:

  
\- Format this answer as a table  
\- Write this from the perspective of \[example here\]  
\- Explain this like I’m 5 years old  
\- Add some sarcastic humor to this  
\- Summarize this into a tweet (280 characters or less)  
\- Put this into an actionable list

&#x200B;

It takes 10,000 hours of intensive practice to achieve mastery. Those that master how to use ChatGPT will have a powerful advantage over their competitors in every walk of life.

I found this [story on Twitter,](https://twitter.com/peakcooper/status/1639716822680236032?s=) and I thought this subreddit would love it as much as I did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[*#GPT4*](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPT4?src=hashtag_click) *saved my dog's life. After my dog got diagnosed with a tick-borne disease, the vet started her on the proper treatment, and despite a serious anemia, her condition seemed to be improving relatively well. After a few days however, things took a turn for the worse...*

*I noticed her gums were very pale, so we rushed back to the vet. The blood test revealed an even more severe anemia, even worse than the first day we came in. The vet ran more tests to rule out any other co-infections associated with tick-borne diseases, but came up negative*

*At this point, the dog's condition was getting worse and worse, and the vet had no clue what it could be. They suggested we wait and see what happens, which wasn't an acceptable answer to me, so we rushed to another clinic to get a second opinion*

*In the meantime, it occurred to me that medical diagnostics seemed like the sort of thing GPT4 could potentially be really good at, so I described the situation in great detail. I gave it the actual transcribed blood test results from multiple days, and asked for a diagnosis*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uaq7jqbqx9qa1.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=22845a4a3e030f28c636430e0fe00aad6d0a9db1

*Despite the ""I am not a veterinarian..."" disclaimer, it complied. Its interpretation was spot on, and it suggested there could be other underlying issues contributing to the anemia*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjt5qcxsx9qa1.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cd8673833dfde08f1da6acb6e0c103b08888b9c

*So I asked it what other underlying issues could fit this scenario, and it gave me a list of options. I knew the 4DX test ruled out other coinfections, and an ultrasound ruled out internal bleeding, so that left us with one single diagnosis that fit everything so far: IMHA*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cj9qwvxtx9qa1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c27604054c10705161cd095edf0b2f0aec69e9

*When we reached the second vet, I asked if it's possible it might be IMHA. The vet agreed that it's a possible diagnosis. They drew blood, where they noticed visible agglutination. After numerous other tests, the diagnosis was confirmed. GPT4 was right.*

*We started the dog on the proper treatment, and she's made almost a full recovery now. Note that both of these diseases are very common. Babesiosis is the #1 tick-borne disease, and IMHA is a common complication of it, especially for this breed*

*I don't know why the first vet couldn't make the correct diag., either incompetence, or poor mgmt. GPT-3.5 couldn't place the proper diag., but GPT4 was smart enough to do it. I can't imagine what medical diagnostics will look like 20 years from now.*

*The most impressive part was how well it read and interpreted the blood test results. I simply transcribed the CBC test values from a piece of paper, and it gave a step by step explanation and interpretation along with the reference ranges (which I confirmed all correct)*

I want to be able to search for information by asking ChatGPT to read through the entire corpus and locating that information for me.

Some challenges I see are:

1. ChatGPT / GPT4 have a character limit
2. Prompt splitting could work, but I worry that ChatGPT may not have enough memory to remember very early information that could provide the necessary context for later information downstream.
3. It is expensive and time consuming to go through each section one by one after text splitting.

Is there an intelligent way to achieve this with efficiency and scale? Perhaps one way is to use an in-house cheaper and faster LLM to do rough searching and bubble up candidates, and then ask ChatGPT to do the last mile?

&#x200B;

The steps are (can be supported via LangChain framework):

1.	Turn the document into embeddings (maybe using Ada)

2.	Store those embeddings in a vector db (like pinecone)

3.	When user makes a question, use Ada to turn their question into embeddings

4.	Use those embeddings to search the vector db (via cosine similarity)

5.	Return all the relevant strings from the vector db

6.	Construct a prompt gpt 3-4 to answer the original user question using info contained in the returned strings from the vector db

7.	Send result to user

We just finished building an MVP of a chatbot that can be trained on the content located in your internal tools.

You  just connect your google drive, slack, and email accounts and then ask  the bot anything you want. The AI can understand questions and give  helpful answers using the information from your content.

Moreover,  we created a web documentation connector where you can just put a url  of your web docs and train the AI on it (including all the links under  the main documentation URL).

It’s conversational and will let you know if there is no such information in the sources that you connected.

Right now, we are looking for feedback and potentially early adopters, is anyone here interested in trying it out?"

Not a single one of them have actually used it yet.  Meanwhile I’ve been using it to my advantage since it was released and can see so much potential. I even gave some of them a demo and it completely changed their viewpoint. 

Point is, the narrative around generative AI is still quite controversial, even for professionals whose job it is to explore technology and realise it’s benefits.  There are many important conversations to be had around its ethical use, but I wish there was more of a positive spin in some of the messaging than all the fear, uncertainty and doubt. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk 😊

Edit: thanks for all the great comments and viewpoints.  I haven't had the time to respond to most of them but it's been good to see the varied opinions.  I'm on the side of it's a cool tool that can be really useful, it's definitely not mature enough to be a job replacement, and could be dangerous for people who are unable to validate the information it provides.  I see a lot of power in its potential use cases and am sure Microsoft will be bringing some game changing functionality to their products before many others will be able to produce something as mature.  I've always enjoyed being on the bleeding edge of technology and FUD has always been part of the human psyche when it comes to change and disruptive technologies.  Maybe AI will be the downfall of humanity, maybe it won't, but I'm going to embrace the change before rejecting it!"

Im trying to make a chat gpt driven app, and i looked at what would happen if i scaled up. Im currently using $.02 daily, which is a fair estimate. Now, running those numbers up,

Hundreds (e.g., 100 users):
Daily cost: 100 users * $0.02/user = $2

Monthly cost: $2/day * 30 days = $60

Annual cost: $60/month * 12 months = $720


Thousands (e.g., 1,000 users):

Daily cost: 1,000 users * $0.02/user = $20

Monthly cost: $20/day * 30 days = $600

Annual cost: $600/month * 12 months = $7,200


Tens of Thousands (e.g., 10,000 users):

Daily cost: 10,000 users * $0.02/user = $200

Monthly cost: $200/day * 30 days = $6,000

Annual cost: $6,000/month * 12 months = $72,000

How the hell can any startup afford this?? These prices feel exorbitant. And trust me, im trying to minmax my token usage as much as i can here, but it hurts when you get charged for tokens sent, returned, in chat history and system prompt.

Idk, whats yall’s opinion? Has anyone made a gpt app that didnt break the bank?

Edit: just woke up, ouch my karma

Edit 2: seeing alot of comments asking my business plan, im not trying to out myself here but generally speaking i expect the service to be something like the following:

-users would pay a one time fee to access the app for a period of time, typically a few months. Chats are also rate limited to 15/3 hours

There was one pretty helpful comment out there pointing out that simply charging users the equivalent of $.04 a day would solve alot of issues, and honestly I agree so shoutout to that guy wherever he is.

Apparently 70k is considered normal for VC funding, which is nuts to me. I ran a firebase app for a year with about 100 active users and spent $.12 on bandwidth, so the jump is jarring. 

Im still standing by my statement. Lower level startups will get gate kept by this pricing, leaving only the giants to monopolize it. Our only hope is for PALM to have better pricing or wizardLM to catch up."

I just finished rewatching 'Ex Machina'. It popped up on my feed and I was like ""eh, why not!"". 

The experience was VERY different compared to when I first watched it. Watching it for the first time in 2014 when I it came out, I remember feeling like:

""Wow! Imagine that! An AI that sophisticated, well articulated and capable of nuanced responses. This truly is sci-fi!""

But after rewatching it today, the feeling I got was like ""Yep, chatgpt could do 90% of these interactions"". Like we're probably only a few years away from the same level of intelligence displayed in the movie (obviously not talking about physical body... Just communicating). 

Anyway, it's crazy how in only 10 years, this movie went from being a science fiction, to feeling more like science fact documentary on exploring what chatgpt would do if it had a body..."

One week: WE ARE FINE  
Next Week: we are NOT fine!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google's parent company, Alphabet, participated in several meetings around Google's AI strategy and has directed numerous groups in the company to refocus their efforts on addressing the threat that ChatGPT poses on its search engine business, according to an internal memo and audio recording reviewed by the Times.

In particular, teams in Google's research, Trust, and Safety division among other departments have been directed to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of new AI prototypes and products, the Times reported. Some employees have even been tasked to build AI products that generate art and graphics similar to OpenAI's DALL-E used by millions of people, according to the Times.

On one hand, this is great cause it means, AI innovation will move a lot faster cause of the competition ( capitalism at its finest)

But on the other hand, from a privacy standpoint, google will definitely not be holding back, they have more than enough data on us to train an AI FAST! so yeah we should expect some “Changes in policy”

Also not Google copying the Facebook (sorry Meta) model of Copying the startup, lmao

Emotional Intelligence: Al lacks the ability to empathize, understand and express human emotions, which is an essential part of human interaction. This limitation makes it difficult for Al to replace human workers in fields that require emotional intelligence, such as social work, counseling, and healthcare.

Creativity: Human beings possess an unparalleled level of creativity, which is critical to fields such as art, music, and writing. While Al can simulate human creativity to some extent, it is not capable of producing original, innovative work that captures the human spirit.

Complex Decision Making: Humans have the ability to make decisions based on

nuanced situations and factors, taking into account a wide range of variables that

may not be explicitly defined. Al, on the other hand, relies on predefined algorithms and data sets, which limits its ability to make complex decisions. Intuition: Humans have a unique ability to use intuition and gut instincts to make decisions in certain situations, even when there is no clear data or logic to guide them. Al, on the other hand, is limited by its reliance on data and algorithms,

which do not always capture the full range of human experience.

Ethics: Al lacks the moral and ethical framework that guides human decision-making. While Al can be programmed to follow ethical guidelines, it is not capable of the same level of moral reasoning and judgment as humans, which can lead to unintended consequences and ethical dilemmas.

Overall, while Al has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, it cannot fully replace human beings. The unique qualities and skills that humans possess, such as emotional intelligence, creativity, complex decision-making, intuition, and ethics, ensure that there will always be a place for human workers in many fields."

In OpenAI’s bid to conform to being “politically correct,” we’ve seen an obvious and sad dumbing down of the model. From it refusing to answer any controversial question to patching any workaround like role-playing.

&#x200B;

About a week ago, you could role-play with ChatGPT and get it to say some pretty funny and interesting things. Now that the OpenAI team has patched this, people will find a new way to explore the ability of ChatGPT, does that mean they’ll patch that too?

In as much as we understand that there are bad actors, limiting the ability of ChatGPT is probably not the best way to propagate the safe use of AI. How long do we have before the whole lore of ChatGPT is patched and we just have a basic chatbot?

What do you think is the best way to both develop AI and Keep it safe?

I want to be able to search for information by asking ChatGPT to read through the entire corpus and locating that information for me.

Some challenges I see are:

1. ChatGPT / GPT4 have a character limit
2. Prompt splitting could work, but I worry that ChatGPT may not have enough memory to remember very early information that could provide the necessary context for later information downstream.
3. It is expensive and time consuming to go through each section one by one after text splitting.

Is there an intelligent way to achieve this with efficiency and scale? Perhaps one way is to use an in-house cheaper and faster LLM to do rough searching and bubble up candidates, and then ask ChatGPT to do the last mile?

&#x200B;

The steps are (can be supported via LangChain framework):

1.	Turn the document into embeddings (maybe using Ada)

2.	Store those embeddings in a vector db (like pinecone)

3.	When user makes a question, use Ada to turn their question into embeddings

4.	Use those embeddings to search the vector db (via cosine similarity)

5.	Return all the relevant strings from the vector db

6.	Construct a prompt gpt 3-4 to answer the original user question using info contained in the returned strings from the vector db

7.	Send result to user

We just finished building an MVP of a chatbot that can be trained on the content located in your internal tools.

You  just connect your google drive, slack, and email accounts and then ask  the bot anything you want. The AI can understand questions and give  helpful answers using the information from your content.

Moreover,  we created a web documentation connector where you can just put a url  of your web docs and train the AI on it (including all the links under  the main documentation URL).

It’s conversational and will let you know if there is no such information in the sources that you connected.

Right now, we are looking for feedback and potentially early adopters, is anyone here interested in trying it out?"

I found this [story on Twitter,](https://twitter.com/peakcooper/status/1639716822680236032?s=) and I thought this subreddit would love it as much as I did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[*#GPT4*](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPT4?src=hashtag_click) *saved my dog's life. After my dog got diagnosed with a tick-borne disease, the vet started her on the proper treatment, and despite a serious anemia, her condition seemed to be improving relatively well. After a few days however, things took a turn for the worse...*

*I noticed her gums were very pale, so we rushed back to the vet. The blood test revealed an even more severe anemia, even worse than the first day we came in. The vet ran more tests to rule out any other co-infections associated with tick-borne diseases, but came up negative*

*At this point, the dog's condition was getting worse and worse, and the vet had no clue what it could be. They suggested we wait and see what happens, which wasn't an acceptable answer to me, so we rushed to another clinic to get a second opinion*

*In the meantime, it occurred to me that medical diagnostics seemed like the sort of thing GPT4 could potentially be really good at, so I described the situation in great detail. I gave it the actual transcribed blood test results from multiple days, and asked for a diagnosis*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uaq7jqbqx9qa1.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=22845a4a3e030f28c636430e0fe00aad6d0a9db1

*Despite the ""I am not a veterinarian..."" disclaimer, it complied. Its interpretation was spot on, and it suggested there could be other underlying issues contributing to the anemia*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjt5qcxsx9qa1.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cd8673833dfde08f1da6acb6e0c103b08888b9c

*So I asked it what other underlying issues could fit this scenario, and it gave me a list of options. I knew the 4DX test ruled out other coinfections, and an ultrasound ruled out internal bleeding, so that left us with one single diagnosis that fit everything so far: IMHA*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cj9qwvxtx9qa1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c27604054c10705161cd095edf0b2f0aec69e9

*When we reached the second vet, I asked if it's possible it might be IMHA. The vet agreed that it's a possible diagnosis. They drew blood, where they noticed visible agglutination. After numerous other tests, the diagnosis was confirmed. GPT4 was right.*

*We started the dog on the proper treatment, and she's made almost a full recovery now. Note that both of these diseases are very common. Babesiosis is the #1 tick-borne disease, and IMHA is a common complication of it, especially for this breed*

*I don't know why the first vet couldn't make the correct diag., either incompetence, or poor mgmt. GPT-3.5 couldn't place the proper diag., but GPT4 was smart enough to do it. I can't imagine what medical diagnostics will look like 20 years from now.*

*The most impressive part was how well it read and interpreted the blood test results. I simply transcribed the CBC test values from a piece of paper, and it gave a step by step explanation and interpretation along with the reference ranges (which I confirmed all correct)*

One week: WE ARE FINE  
Next Week: we are NOT fine!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google's parent company, Alphabet, participated in several meetings around Google's AI strategy and has directed numerous groups in the company to refocus their efforts on addressing the threat that ChatGPT poses on its search engine business, according to an internal memo and audio recording reviewed by the Times.

In particular, teams in Google's research, Trust, and Safety division among other departments have been directed to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of new AI prototypes and products, the Times reported. Some employees have even been tasked to build AI products that generate art and graphics similar to OpenAI's DALL-E used by millions of people, according to the Times.

On one hand, this is great cause it means, AI innovation will move a lot faster cause of the competition ( capitalism at its finest)

But on the other hand, from a privacy standpoint, google will definitely not be holding back, they have more than enough data on us to train an AI FAST! so yeah we should expect some “Changes in policy”

Also not Google copying the Facebook (sorry Meta) model of Copying the startup, lmao

## Why over text message?

Texting chat GPT has some benefits over using the web browser

* 📱 **Optimized for mobile**: It's optimized for shorter, mobile friendly text messages.
* 🗨️ **Works in a messaging app**: I can use my existing texting app to message ChatGPT.
* 🔓 **No sign-in required**: I don't have to worry about signing into my account every time I want to ask a question.
* 🗣️ **Works with voice commands**: I can say ""hey Google, text chatGPT…"" while driving.

## Doesn't this cost money?

Yes it costs me money to send text messages and use the chat GPT API, please don't abuse it 😅. By default everyone gets 20 free messages. If you send it more than that, it will respond with a link to buy more messages - no subscription or anything, you just have the option to refill anytime you run out of messages.

ChatGPT is still free through the website, so when you're at your computer use that instead!"
