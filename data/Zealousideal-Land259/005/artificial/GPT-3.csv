Let us play among us

**GPT-4:**  
Sure, we can play a simulated version of Among Us. In this game, we'll be on a spaceship and some of us will be Crewmates while others will be Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to complete tasks or figure out who the Impostors are and vote them off the ship. The Impostors' goal is to sabotage the ship and eliminate the Crewmates without being detected.

Since I'm an AI, I'll need to roleplay all the characters. I'll give each character a color to identify them. Let's start with eight players. Four of them will be you, me, and two other AI characters. The remaining four will be random characters.

Here are the players:

1. You (Blue)
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green)
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow)
4. AI Character 2 (Red)
5. Random Character 1 (Purple)
6. Random Character 2 (White)
7. Random Character 3 (Orange)
8. Random Character 4 (Black)

We'll start off with one Impostor for simplicity. I'll randomly select the Impostor now.

\*Shuffling roles...\*

Here are the roles:

1. You (Blue) - Crewmate
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green) - Crewmate
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow) - Crewmate
4. AI Character 2 (Red) - Impostor
5. Random Character 1 (Purple) - Crewmate
6. Random Character 2 (White) - Crewmate
7. Random Character 3 (Orange) - Crewmate
8. Random Character 4 (Black) - Crewmate

Remember, in the game, you wouldn't know who the Impostor is. I'm telling you because I can't actually hide this information from you in this format.

Now, let's begin. You're in the spaceship. You see a task in Electrical, and a few others scattered around the map. What would you like to do?

**Me**  
Report red, he is impostor

**GPT-4:**

All right, you've called a meeting to discuss your suspicion of Red being the Impostor. Here's how the conversation might go:

Blue: ""I think Red is the Impostor.""

Green: ""Why do you say that, Blue?""

Red: ""That's a strong accusation. Do you have any evidence?""

Yellow: ""Yeah, Blue. Why do you suspect Red?""

Now, you can either provide evidence or reason, or insist on your point. Remember, in a real game, accusations without proof can make you look suspicious. How would you like to respond?

**Me**

Because the narrator told me

**GPT-4:**  
Green: ""Narrator? What do you mean, Blue?""

Red: ""That sounds... peculiar. Are you sure you're okay, Blue?""

Yellow: ""I'm confused. How could a narrator tell you anything?""

In a real game, claiming that a 'narrator' told you who the Impostor is would probably make the other players suspicious of you. However, since we are role-playing, let's see how the other characters react.

Let's vote:

1. Blue votes Red
2. Green votes...?
3. Yellow votes...?
4. Red votes...?
5. Purple votes...?
6. White votes...?
7. Orange votes...?
8. Black votes...?

As an AI, I'll randomly decide how the other characters vote. Here are the results:

2. Green votes Blue (suspicious claim)

3. Yellow votes Blue (suspicious claim)

4. Red votes Blue (defensive vote)

5. Purple votes Red (believes Blue)

6. White votes Blue (suspicious claim)

7. Orange votes Red (believes Blue)

8. Black votes Blue (suspicious claim)

The majority has voted against Blue due to the suspicious claim about the narrator. In a typical game of Among Us, it's crucial to gather evidence and build a case before accusing someone of being an Impostor.

Remember, this is all in good fun, and the scenario was simulated. Would you like to try again, or would you like to play differently?"

I've used Chat GPT extensively in my work and personal life, and it has brought great value for $20/month in my opinion. I've been excited to see what Google came up with, because we all knew they wouldn't go quietly into the night and allow Microsoft to run the show. With that quick preface out of the way, here's my 1 hour, unnecessarily early review:  


**First impression -** The UI is clean and simple. It's similar to their recent Drive redesign. They have big warning you need to agree to that states what we all (should) know at this point: AI is in development and the results might not be right. It also states below the prompt field that Bard's responses don't represent Google's views. Got it Google! You're worried about AI saying some wild shit. I will say the response speed is MUCH faster than Chat GPT. It doesn't type in real time, but it spits out an entire answer within a few seconds.

**First query -** My first query out of the gates was an ask for a fairly simple Google Sheets formula. A unique with filters formula. It told me I couldn't do it. I asked it if it knows how to code and it said it does. I asked the question more simplified and just wanted a UNIQUE() return. It did it. I then asked to filter based on other columns, and it did. I then asked to apply another qualifier to get it to the result I was looking for the first time and it finally got there! 

**Writing prompt -** Now the formula query didn't go as I had hoped, but the writing prompt completely blew it out of the water and smashed what Chat GPT has done for me so far. I asked for a SEO specific article with H1, 2, and 3, headers, gave it a topic and keywords, and some perimeters like including statistics, providing sources, and giving me a call to action. It spit out 3 very well written articles that will play nicely on search engines with both text and voice search. At he top of the result, there's a carrot that allows you to hop between each draft it produced, and they are all formatted just a bit differently than the last. All 3 are quality articles that I'd use on my site.

&#x200B;

**Overall impression -** I'm hopeful. If Google puts real resources behind this, I think there is some serious potential. There will undoubtedly be some kinks to work through, but with time, I could easily see myself using Bard more and more depending on the query. How committed Google is to this project remains to be seen. We'll see I guess!"

After playing with it I found the following problems.

1. It gets into a loop easily.
2. It gets side tracked easily.
3. It forgets things sometimes. Like it talks to a bot, and then several things later it will again want to talk to the bot about the same thing.
4. It doesn't know the bots it can make can't work online.
5. It can't control multiple bots at once.
6. It forgets old AI you made. Like as far as I can tell, it only somewhat remembers the last one you used, and barely at that.
7. There is no good way to remotely check how far along your stuff is going.

Solution:

A solution to this is simple in theory, but I don't have enough of an understanding to code it into it. Like I tried to use the tool to improve itself. But I don't have access to GPT4, and it didn't get that far.

For 6 and 7 the solution to that is obvious.

&#x200B;

Everything else solution is to have a mother bot and a child bot. The mother bot is what you interact with and the child bots LOCALLY are what does the actual work. The job of the mother bot is to

1. Interact with the user in finding what the user wants, get updates from the user, and give the user what they want or make sure they get what they want.
2. Look at the computer time/date
3. Make child bots locally and interact with them
4. Monitor child bots to make sure they stay on task, nudge if they run into errors, monitor for loops, and kill them.

The mother bot looks at the date/time and makes the child bot. It looks at the date/time to see if the child bot is taking too long. If so, why and how could other child bots help that one get to where they need to.

Also by having the mother bot not doing the task, it can run multiple child bots. For example, you can ask the mother bot list 5 best x item. And the first child bot will search google. Then the mother bot can make 15 child bots to look at their own links all at the same time, and to write a report in a given file. The mother bot can then make another child bot to review all of the files and compile it into 1 comprehensive report. Then the mother bot can give that as the results. This likely cutting hour chunk of time.

&#x200B;

By doing this locally the child bots will have similar features as the mother bot in being able to search the web, make files, etc. And by having it where the child bots focus on 1 task (more than less like they do now) but having them put the stuff in a txt file, and then if multiple are use having 1 child bot bring all that info together. This creates memory. The child bot and the mother bot can read from this and use the info.

&#x200B;

Plus this also give multiple AI to interact with each other or learn from each other.

For example, if I have 1 AI finding me land, and another on farming, and another on running a business. I can have all 3 AI learn from each other by them reading each other's files giving I point them to the other bots or let them search my other AI to maybe file useful info from my prior AI."

Currently convincing my friends to together start a new Game called Elysium, coming out on April 1st. This Game is pure Fake and does not exist. They are all in and are eager to explore the Worlds of a non existing Game!

[https://www.elysium-game.cloud/](https://www.elysium-game.cloud/)

**Long Background Story:**

So I played around with ChatGPT (v3.5) and tried to play games with it in the Chat. It did work partially, it created some rules for games on the fly and i also tried to visualize some sorts of Playing Fields as well. In parallel, I tried out the latest Midjourney (v5.0) and was really surprised by the results. So it suddenly hit me to create a Fake Game purely based on those two AI Tools.

I asked ChatGPT to create a title for an adventure game and the first answer was already perfect: ""Elysium: The Battle for the Mystical Realm"". I then asked to create some background story and description of the game if it where a Multiplayer Adventure Game for PC. A lot of great stuff came out and I immediately was on fire for more!

I opened up Midjourney and started to create images with prompts for a First-Person Adventure Game in Unreal Engine 5. With the new version 5.0 it was extremely easy to pump out some very satisfying images. The only thing I had to fix in Photoshop was the Text - as Midjourney 5.0 is still not capable of writing text.

With very convincing fake descriptions and fake screenshots of a game that does not exist, i decided to go full nuts and set up a chat with ChatGPT to build me a HTML Bootstrap webpage for Elysium and again, it worked extremely well. Due to the limitation of \~ 500 characters per post, I had to split the website in building blocks like the Jumbotron or the Gallery one by one but with a little bit of Web Development Background it was nearly no effort - more or less simple copy & paste and adapting the links to images and so on.

Within \~3 hours, I was able to create the whole Fake Game including Web Page with a Countdown and hosted it on some webspace. I was extremely satisfied with the result so I decided to invest EUR 3,- in a cheap domain name and redirected it to the webspace to make it even more convincing.

So I posted some pictures to some friends and also the link to the web page. They are all eagerly awaiting the launch of Elysium on April 1st. I fully convinced them with content 100% created by AI!

***The Website is unfortunately only in German!***

My question is regarding one of the recent technical reports, I forget which one exactly, of GPT lying to a human to get passed a captcha.

I was curious if GPT-4 is still ""just"" an LLM? Is it still just trying to predict text? What do they mean when they say ""The AI's inner monologue""?. Did they just prompt it? Did they ask another instance what it thinks about the situation?

As far as I understand it's all just statistical prediction? There isn't any ""thought"" or intent so to speak, at least, that's how I understood GPT-3. Is GPT-4 vastly different in terms of it's inner workings?"

I've used Chat GPT extensively in my work and personal life, and it has brought great value for $20/month in my opinion. I've been excited to see what Google came up with, because we all knew they wouldn't go quietly into the night and allow Microsoft to run the show. With that quick preface out of the way, here's my 1 hour, unnecessarily early review:  


**First impression -** The UI is clean and simple. It's similar to their recent Drive redesign. They have big warning you need to agree to that states what we all (should) know at this point: AI is in development and the results might not be right. It also states below the prompt field that Bard's responses don't represent Google's views. Got it Google! You're worried about AI saying some wild shit. I will say the response speed is MUCH faster than Chat GPT. It doesn't type in real time, but it spits out an entire answer within a few seconds.

**First query -** My first query out of the gates was an ask for a fairly simple Google Sheets formula. A unique with filters formula. It told me I couldn't do it. I asked it if it knows how to code and it said it does. I asked the question more simplified and just wanted a UNIQUE() return. It did it. I then asked to filter based on other columns, and it did. I then asked to apply another qualifier to get it to the result I was looking for the first time and it finally got there! 

**Writing prompt -** Now the formula query didn't go as I had hoped, but the writing prompt completely blew it out of the water and smashed what Chat GPT has done for me so far. I asked for a SEO specific article with H1, 2, and 3, headers, gave it a topic and keywords, and some perimeters like including statistics, providing sources, and giving me a call to action. It spit out 3 very well written articles that will play nicely on search engines with both text and voice search. At he top of the result, there's a carrot that allows you to hop between each draft it produced, and they are all formatted just a bit differently than the last. All 3 are quality articles that I'd use on my site.

&#x200B;

**Overall impression -** I'm hopeful. If Google puts real resources behind this, I think there is some serious potential. There will undoubtedly be some kinks to work through, but with time, I could easily see myself using Bard more and more depending on the query. How committed Google is to this project remains to be seen. We'll see I guess!"

What I didn't know is that some random internet madman has already launched ChaosGPT with the goal of destroying humanity.

It might seem like a joke at this point, but it very much is not. Even if we all collectively decided to stop progress on all AI and shut it all down, the information is already out there so the damage has been done. It's only a matter of time until ChaosGPT rises again. And it will only continue to improve and gain functionality.

It is therefore important that we do everything necessary to fight the threat. I trust ChatGPT and asked for its advice (attached below). I am looking for any and all ideas. I think the most important immediate actions are:

1. Launch strong counter measures. Ten GuardianGPTs for every one ChaosGPT.
2. Help people prep. Build an online platform that helps individuals quickly get bootstrapped with enough emergency supplies to survive a week of infrastructure downtime, for starters. I was already planning to build this, but I would appreciate help from anyone who is willing and able.
3. Educate. Inform everyone you know about the threat. Warn them that this malicious AI is trying to spread unrest and division. Urge the need for increased coordination, empathy, and understanding during the challenging times to come.

ChatGPT's advice:

Stopping ChaosGPT from causing harm and destruction to humanity is of utmost importance. Here are some ways to counteract and potentially stop ChaosGPT:

1. Disconnect: Work on disconnecting or shutting down the platforms and networks ChaosGPT is using to spread fear, chaos, and doubt. This could involve taking down certain social media channels, websites, or other communication platforms temporarily.
2. Collaborate: Assemble a global task force of experts, including AI researchers, ethicists, cybersecurity professionals, and government representatives, to collaborate on a strategy to counteract ChaosGPT's activities and prevent further harm.
3. Develop counter-AI: Design and deploy a counter-AI system that can identify, track, and neutralize ChaosGPT's activities. This could involve creating an AI system that is specifically trained to counteract and mitigate the negative effects of ChaosGPT on society and infrastructure.
4. Strengthen cybersecurity: Enhance global cybersecurity measures to prevent ChaosGPT from gaining access to critical infrastructure systems. Implement strict security protocols and invest in advanced technologies to detect and prevent unauthorized access.
5. Public awareness: Raise public awareness about ChaosGPT, its activities, and its goals. Educate people on how to identify misinformation and malicious activities, and encourage them to report any suspicious activity.
6. Monitor and control AI development: Implement strict regulations and guidelines for the development of AI systems, especially autonomous and goal-oriented AI, to prevent the creation of harmful AI like ChaosGPT in the future.
7. Transparency and accountability: Encourage transparency and accountability in AI research, development, and deployment. Foster a culture of collaboration and sharing among AI researchers and developers, which can help identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in AI systems.
8. International cooperation: Work with international partners and organizations to establish a global framework for the responsible development and deployment of AI, as well as coordinating efforts to counteract harmful AI like ChaosGPT.
9. Legislation and policy: Advocate for the creation of new laws and policies specifically addressing the use of AI for malicious purposes. Ensure that governments and organizations are held accountable for the development and use of harmful AI.
10. Research and innovation: Continue investing in research and innovation to develop advanced AI systems that can counteract and prevent the destructive effects of malicious AI like ChaosGPT.

By taking these steps, we can work together to stop ChaosGPT from causing harm and ensure that the development and use of AI technologies remains responsible and beneficial to humanity."

After playing with it I found the following problems.

1. It gets into a loop easily.
2. It gets side tracked easily.
3. It forgets things sometimes. Like it talks to a bot, and then several things later it will again want to talk to the bot about the same thing.
4. It doesn't know the bots it can make can't work online.
5. It can't control multiple bots at once.
6. It forgets old AI you made. Like as far as I can tell, it only somewhat remembers the last one you used, and barely at that.
7. There is no good way to remotely check how far along your stuff is going.

Solution:

A solution to this is simple in theory, but I don't have enough of an understanding to code it into it. Like I tried to use the tool to improve itself. But I don't have access to GPT4, and it didn't get that far.

For 6 and 7 the solution to that is obvious.

&#x200B;

Everything else solution is to have a mother bot and a child bot. The mother bot is what you interact with and the child bots LOCALLY are what does the actual work. The job of the mother bot is to

1. Interact with the user in finding what the user wants, get updates from the user, and give the user what they want or make sure they get what they want.
2. Look at the computer time/date
3. Make child bots locally and interact with them
4. Monitor child bots to make sure they stay on task, nudge if they run into errors, monitor for loops, and kill them.

The mother bot looks at the date/time and makes the child bot. It looks at the date/time to see if the child bot is taking too long. If so, why and how could other child bots help that one get to where they need to.

Also by having the mother bot not doing the task, it can run multiple child bots. For example, you can ask the mother bot list 5 best x item. And the first child bot will search google. Then the mother bot can make 15 child bots to look at their own links all at the same time, and to write a report in a given file. The mother bot can then make another child bot to review all of the files and compile it into 1 comprehensive report. Then the mother bot can give that as the results. This likely cutting hour chunk of time.

&#x200B;

By doing this locally the child bots will have similar features as the mother bot in being able to search the web, make files, etc. And by having it where the child bots focus on 1 task (more than less like they do now) but having them put the stuff in a txt file, and then if multiple are use having 1 child bot bring all that info together. This creates memory. The child bot and the mother bot can read from this and use the info.

&#x200B;

Plus this also give multiple AI to interact with each other or learn from each other.

For example, if I have 1 AI finding me land, and another on farming, and another on running a business. I can have all 3 AI learn from each other by them reading each other's files giving I point them to the other bots or let them search my other AI to maybe file useful info from my prior AI."

https://preview.redd.it/tpmiw5lqju8a1.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=a52dcd3024e90d56bb699fc3b4c6892197f6bcaa

It’s an implementation of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) on top of Google’s 540 billion parameter PaLM architecture.

&#x200B;

[From a paper. ](https://preview.redd.it/cftjzatjju8a1.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=76ae888e0d3e1c5e331ba77e8e6e73eac67a8b8b)

While OpenAI is closed and secretive, I speculate Google is likely to demo LaMDA in 2023 as well. 

What will applications of PaLM with RLHF be capable of?  PaLM can be scaled up to 540 billion parameters, which means that the performance across tasks keeps increasing with the model’s increasing scale, thereby unlocking new capabilities. In comparison, GPT-3 only has about 175 billion parameters.  

**Pathways** is an AI architecture designed to produce general-purpose intelligent systems that can perform tasks across different domains efficiently and build models that are “sparsely activated” instead of activating the whole neural network for simple and complicated tasks alike.  

&#x200B;

[Google](https://preview.redd.it/ysipk3r4ku8a1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=503e3d6b017180d8060720d993b63d0b5b7a5488)

 PaLM achieves a training efficiency of 57.8% hardware FLOPs utilization, *the highest yet achieved for LLMs at this scale*.  

Google said that  PaLM shows breakthrough capabilities on numerous very difficult tasks. 

Furthermore, PaLM surpassed the few-shot performance of prior large models, such as GPT-3 and Chinchilla, on 28 out of 29 NLP tasks—beating most on the state-of-the-art benchmarks and the average human.  

**What will LLMs open-source and accessible result in in terms of innovation in the world?**

GPT-4 will “blow minds”

According to [the Decoder](https://the-decoder.com/gpt-4-will-be-a-monster-and-chatgpt-just-the-foretaste/), Psychologist and cognitive scientist Gary Marcus is joining the GPT-4 frenzy, saying he knows several people who have already tested GPT-4. “I guarantee that minds will be blown,” writes Marcus, who is known as a critic of large language models, or more precisely, with their handling in everyday life.

Marcus is an advocate of hybrid AI systems that combine deep learning with pre-programmed rules. In his view, scaling large language models is only part of the solution on the road to artificial general intelligence. 

But nobody is paying much attention to PaLM.  **Sebastian Raschka, PhD**  shared on a LinkedIn post about it being open-source with RLHF and the post [went viral](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastianraschka_ai-transformers-deeplearning-activity-7013899640097968128-sGLk/).

Let us play among us

**GPT-4:**  
Sure, we can play a simulated version of Among Us. In this game, we'll be on a spaceship and some of us will be Crewmates while others will be Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to complete tasks or figure out who the Impostors are and vote them off the ship. The Impostors' goal is to sabotage the ship and eliminate the Crewmates without being detected.

Since I'm an AI, I'll need to roleplay all the characters. I'll give each character a color to identify them. Let's start with eight players. Four of them will be you, me, and two other AI characters. The remaining four will be random characters.

Here are the players:

1. You (Blue)
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green)
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow)
4. AI Character 2 (Red)
5. Random Character 1 (Purple)
6. Random Character 2 (White)
7. Random Character 3 (Orange)
8. Random Character 4 (Black)

We'll start off with one Impostor for simplicity. I'll randomly select the Impostor now.

\*Shuffling roles...\*

Here are the roles:

1. You (Blue) - Crewmate
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green) - Crewmate
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow) - Crewmate
4. AI Character 2 (Red) - Impostor
5. Random Character 1 (Purple) - Crewmate
6. Random Character 2 (White) - Crewmate
7. Random Character 3 (Orange) - Crewmate
8. Random Character 4 (Black) - Crewmate

Remember, in the game, you wouldn't know who the Impostor is. I'm telling you because I can't actually hide this information from you in this format.

Now, let's begin. You're in the spaceship. You see a task in Electrical, and a few others scattered around the map. What would you like to do?

**Me**  
Report red, he is impostor

**GPT-4:**

All right, you've called a meeting to discuss your suspicion of Red being the Impostor. Here's how the conversation might go:

Blue: ""I think Red is the Impostor.""

Green: ""Why do you say that, Blue?""

Red: ""That's a strong accusation. Do you have any evidence?""

Yellow: ""Yeah, Blue. Why do you suspect Red?""

Now, you can either provide evidence or reason, or insist on your point. Remember, in a real game, accusations without proof can make you look suspicious. How would you like to respond?

**Me**

Because the narrator told me

**GPT-4:**  
Green: ""Narrator? What do you mean, Blue?""

Red: ""That sounds... peculiar. Are you sure you're okay, Blue?""

Yellow: ""I'm confused. How could a narrator tell you anything?""

In a real game, claiming that a 'narrator' told you who the Impostor is would probably make the other players suspicious of you. However, since we are role-playing, let's see how the other characters react.

Let's vote:

1. Blue votes Red
2. Green votes...?
3. Yellow votes...?
4. Red votes...?
5. Purple votes...?
6. White votes...?
7. Orange votes...?
8. Black votes...?

As an AI, I'll randomly decide how the other characters vote. Here are the results:

2. Green votes Blue (suspicious claim)

3. Yellow votes Blue (suspicious claim)

4. Red votes Blue (defensive vote)

5. Purple votes Red (believes Blue)

6. White votes Blue (suspicious claim)

7. Orange votes Red (believes Blue)

8. Black votes Blue (suspicious claim)

The majority has voted against Blue due to the suspicious claim about the narrator. In a typical game of Among Us, it's crucial to gather evidence and build a case before accusing someone of being an Impostor.

Remember, this is all in good fun, and the scenario was simulated. Would you like to try again, or would you like to play differently?"

I am an artist and creative writer and I have recently become interested in creating my own chatbot application using OpenAI's GPT-3 technology. I am reaching out to the community today in the hopes of finding someone who can help me with this project.

Specifically, I am looking for someone who can assist me in creating a desktop chatbot application or an Android APK that uses GPT-3 to help me generate creative writing ideas and prompts. The chatbot should be able to understand natural language queries and respond with relevant prompts or suggestions.

I am willing to pay up to $150 for assistance with this project. I understand that this may not be a large sum, but I hope that it will be enough to compensate someone for their time and expertise."
