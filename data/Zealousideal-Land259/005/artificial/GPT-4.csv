He found that GPT-4 can solve 10 out of 10 problems from before 2021, but none of the recent problems. He suspects that this is due to data contamination, meaning that GPT-4 has seen some of the older problems in its training data, but not the newer ones. He also shows some examples of how he tested GPT-4 and the solutions it generated.

This is an interesting finding, as it suggests that GPT-4’s performance on coding tasks is heavily dependent on the quality and freshness of its training data. It also raises questions about how much GPT-4 actually understands the logic and syntax of programming languages, and how well it can generalize to new and unseen problems. What do you think about this? Do you think GPT-4 can ever become a competent coder, or will it always be limited by data contamination?

Let us play among us

**GPT-4:**  
Sure, we can play a simulated version of Among Us. In this game, we'll be on a spaceship and some of us will be Crewmates while others will be Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to complete tasks or figure out who the Impostors are and vote them off the ship. The Impostors' goal is to sabotage the ship and eliminate the Crewmates without being detected.

Since I'm an AI, I'll need to roleplay all the characters. I'll give each character a color to identify them. Let's start with eight players. Four of them will be you, me, and two other AI characters. The remaining four will be random characters.

Here are the players:

1. You (Blue)
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green)
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow)
4. AI Character 2 (Red)
5. Random Character 1 (Purple)
6. Random Character 2 (White)
7. Random Character 3 (Orange)
8. Random Character 4 (Black)

We'll start off with one Impostor for simplicity. I'll randomly select the Impostor now.

\*Shuffling roles...\*

Here are the roles:

1. You (Blue) - Crewmate
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green) - Crewmate
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow) - Crewmate
4. AI Character 2 (Red) - Impostor
5. Random Character 1 (Purple) - Crewmate
6. Random Character 2 (White) - Crewmate
7. Random Character 3 (Orange) - Crewmate
8. Random Character 4 (Black) - Crewmate

Remember, in the game, you wouldn't know who the Impostor is. I'm telling you because I can't actually hide this information from you in this format.

Now, let's begin. You're in the spaceship. You see a task in Electrical, and a few others scattered around the map. What would you like to do?

**Me**  
Report red, he is impostor

**GPT-4:**

All right, you've called a meeting to discuss your suspicion of Red being the Impostor. Here's how the conversation might go:

Blue: ""I think Red is the Impostor.""

Green: ""Why do you say that, Blue?""

Red: ""That's a strong accusation. Do you have any evidence?""

Yellow: ""Yeah, Blue. Why do you suspect Red?""

Now, you can either provide evidence or reason, or insist on your point. Remember, in a real game, accusations without proof can make you look suspicious. How would you like to respond?

**Me**

Because the narrator told me

**GPT-4:**  
Green: ""Narrator? What do you mean, Blue?""

Red: ""That sounds... peculiar. Are you sure you're okay, Blue?""

Yellow: ""I'm confused. How could a narrator tell you anything?""

In a real game, claiming that a 'narrator' told you who the Impostor is would probably make the other players suspicious of you. However, since we are role-playing, let's see how the other characters react.

Let's vote:

1. Blue votes Red
2. Green votes...?
3. Yellow votes...?
4. Red votes...?
5. Purple votes...?
6. White votes...?
7. Orange votes...?
8. Black votes...?

As an AI, I'll randomly decide how the other characters vote. Here are the results:

2. Green votes Blue (suspicious claim)

3. Yellow votes Blue (suspicious claim)

4. Red votes Blue (defensive vote)

5. Purple votes Red (believes Blue)

6. White votes Blue (suspicious claim)

7. Orange votes Red (believes Blue)

8. Black votes Blue (suspicious claim)

The majority has voted against Blue due to the suspicious claim about the narrator. In a typical game of Among Us, it's crucial to gather evidence and build a case before accusing someone of being an Impostor.

Remember, this is all in good fun, and the scenario was simulated. Would you like to try again, or would you like to play differently?"

After playing with it I found the following problems.

1. It gets into a loop easily.
2. It gets side tracked easily.
3. It forgets things sometimes. Like it talks to a bot, and then several things later it will again want to talk to the bot about the same thing.
4. It doesn't know the bots it can make can't work online.
5. It can't control multiple bots at once.
6. It forgets old AI you made. Like as far as I can tell, it only somewhat remembers the last one you used, and barely at that.
7. There is no good way to remotely check how far along your stuff is going.

Solution:

A solution to this is simple in theory, but I don't have enough of an understanding to code it into it. Like I tried to use the tool to improve itself. But I don't have access to GPT4, and it didn't get that far.

For 6 and 7 the solution to that is obvious.

&#x200B;

Everything else solution is to have a mother bot and a child bot. The mother bot is what you interact with and the child bots LOCALLY are what does the actual work. The job of the mother bot is to

1. Interact with the user in finding what the user wants, get updates from the user, and give the user what they want or make sure they get what they want.
2. Look at the computer time/date
3. Make child bots locally and interact with them
4. Monitor child bots to make sure they stay on task, nudge if they run into errors, monitor for loops, and kill them.

The mother bot looks at the date/time and makes the child bot. It looks at the date/time to see if the child bot is taking too long. If so, why and how could other child bots help that one get to where they need to.

Also by having the mother bot not doing the task, it can run multiple child bots. For example, you can ask the mother bot list 5 best x item. And the first child bot will search google. Then the mother bot can make 15 child bots to look at their own links all at the same time, and to write a report in a given file. The mother bot can then make another child bot to review all of the files and compile it into 1 comprehensive report. Then the mother bot can give that as the results. This likely cutting hour chunk of time.

&#x200B;

By doing this locally the child bots will have similar features as the mother bot in being able to search the web, make files, etc. And by having it where the child bots focus on 1 task (more than less like they do now) but having them put the stuff in a txt file, and then if multiple are use having 1 child bot bring all that info together. This creates memory. The child bot and the mother bot can read from this and use the info.

&#x200B;

Plus this also give multiple AI to interact with each other or learn from each other.

For example, if I have 1 AI finding me land, and another on farming, and another on running a business. I can have all 3 AI learn from each other by them reading each other's files giving I point them to the other bots or let them search my other AI to maybe file useful info from my prior AI."

https://preview.redd.it/tpmiw5lqju8a1.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=a52dcd3024e90d56bb699fc3b4c6892197f6bcaa

It’s an implementation of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) on top of Google’s 540 billion parameter PaLM architecture.

&#x200B;

[From a paper. ](https://preview.redd.it/cftjzatjju8a1.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=76ae888e0d3e1c5e331ba77e8e6e73eac67a8b8b)

While OpenAI is closed and secretive, I speculate Google is likely to demo LaMDA in 2023 as well. 

What will applications of PaLM with RLHF be capable of?  PaLM can be scaled up to 540 billion parameters, which means that the performance across tasks keeps increasing with the model’s increasing scale, thereby unlocking new capabilities. In comparison, GPT-3 only has about 175 billion parameters.  

**Pathways** is an AI architecture designed to produce general-purpose intelligent systems that can perform tasks across different domains efficiently and build models that are “sparsely activated” instead of activating the whole neural network for simple and complicated tasks alike.  

&#x200B;

[Google](https://preview.redd.it/ysipk3r4ku8a1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=503e3d6b017180d8060720d993b63d0b5b7a5488)

 PaLM achieves a training efficiency of 57.8% hardware FLOPs utilization, *the highest yet achieved for LLMs at this scale*.  

Google said that  PaLM shows breakthrough capabilities on numerous very difficult tasks. 

Furthermore, PaLM surpassed the few-shot performance of prior large models, such as GPT-3 and Chinchilla, on 28 out of 29 NLP tasks—beating most on the state-of-the-art benchmarks and the average human.  

**What will LLMs open-source and accessible result in in terms of innovation in the world?**

GPT-4 will “blow minds”

According to [the Decoder](https://the-decoder.com/gpt-4-will-be-a-monster-and-chatgpt-just-the-foretaste/), Psychologist and cognitive scientist Gary Marcus is joining the GPT-4 frenzy, saying he knows several people who have already tested GPT-4. “I guarantee that minds will be blown,” writes Marcus, who is known as a critic of large language models, or more precisely, with their handling in everyday life.

Marcus is an advocate of hybrid AI systems that combine deep learning with pre-programmed rules. In his view, scaling large language models is only part of the solution on the road to artificial general intelligence. 

But nobody is paying much attention to PaLM.  **Sebastian Raschka, PhD**  shared on a LinkedIn post about it being open-source with RLHF and the post [went viral](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastianraschka_ai-transformers-deeplearning-activity-7013899640097968128-sGLk/). Some of the comments may be worth reading."

I was curious if GPT-4 is still ""just"" an LLM? Is it still just trying to predict text? What do they mean when they say ""The AI's inner monologue""?. Did they just prompt it? Did they ask another instance what it thinks about the situation?

As far as I understand it's all just statistical prediction? There isn't any ""thought"" or intent so to speak, at least, that's how I understood GPT-3. Is GPT-4 vastly different in terms of it's inner workings?"

36,12691y3,artificial,GPT-4,top,2023-03-30 02:43:30,A Rebuttal to the Call for a Six-Month Pause on AI Development: Stifling Progress is Not the Solution (GPT 4),aluode,False,0.77,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/12691y3/a_rebuttal_to_the_call_for_a_sixmonth_pause_on_ai/,40,1680144210.0,"In a recent CBS News article, Michael Roppolo reported on an open letter signed by Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Andrew Yang, and over a thousand others, which calls for a six-month pause on AI development to address ""profound risks to society and humanity."" While the concerns raised by the signatories are valid, putting the brakes on AI development is not the most effective solution to the challenges we face.

First, it is essential to acknowledge the rapid advancements in AI, as exemplified by OpenAI's GPT-4. However, the development of powerful AI technologies has also resulted in substantial benefits across various industries, such as healthcare, transportation, and agriculture. By calling for a blanket pause on AI development, we risk stifling the progress that could lead to life-saving breakthroughs and more efficient systems.

Moreover, the pause fails to recognize that AI development is a global endeavor, and unilateral action by a group of concerned individuals is unlikely to have a significant impact on the pace of progress. Artificial intelligence research and development are being pursued by numerous organizations and countries worldwide, and a temporary halt in one area will only result in others pushing ahead.

Instead of attempting to halt AI development, we should advocate for a more collaborative approach to address the concerns raised by the signatories. By fostering an environment of cooperation and information-sharing among AI researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders, we can collectively develop best practices and ethical guidelines to mitigate potential risks.

One of the primary concerns highlighted in the open letter is the potential for AI systems like ChatGPT to be misused for spreading misinformation or generating ""grassroots"" letters to Congress. While these concerns are valid, the answer lies not in halting AI development, but in creating more robust detection and mitigation systems to counter malicious uses of the technology.

In addition, by working together with policymakers, researchers can help shape regulations that ensure AI is developed and deployed responsibly. This collaborative effort should focus on building AI systems that are accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal, as the open letter suggests.

He found that GPT-4 can solve 10 out of 10 problems from before 2021, but none of the recent problems. He suspects that this is due to data contamination, meaning that GPT-4 has seen some of the older problems in its training data, but not the newer ones. He also shows some examples of how he tested GPT-4 and the solutions it generated.

This is an interesting finding, as it suggests that GPT-4’s performance on coding tasks is heavily dependent on the quality and freshness of its training data. It also raises questions about how much GPT-4 actually understands the logic and syntax of programming languages, and how well it can generalize to new and unseen problems. What do you think about this? Do you think GPT-4 can ever become a competent coder, or will it always be limited by data contamination?

Learn CS; AGI does not supplant CS

Learn CS; AGI does supplant CS

Don’t learn CS; AGI does not supplant CS

Don’t learn CS; AGI does supplant CS

Any AGI which is capable of seriously outcompeting human programers will necessarily be better or on-par with the researchers who wrote that AGI’s original code. Therefore any AGI proficient in CS will rapidly improve to ASI and depending on how it is aligned will either kill everyone or give everyone utopian superabundance. Whether or not you have learned CS makes no difference in this scenario because you are dead or in superabundance regardless.

Therefore; the only situation worth planning for is if AGI does not fully supplant human programers in our lifetime. I think this is incredibly unlikely, but as previously described your decision in the AGI—>ASI scenario makes no difference for the same reason that if you think nuclear war is 95% likely you should still plan as if it was 0% likely because no action changes the outcome.

While the concerns raised by the signatories are valid, putting the brakes on AI development is not the most effective solution to the challenges we face.

First, it is essential to acknowledge the rapid advancements in AI, as exemplified by OpenAI's GPT-4. However, the development of powerful AI technologies has also resulted in substantial benefits across various industries, such as healthcare, transportation, and agriculture. By calling for a blanket pause on AI development, we risk stifling the progress that could lead to life-saving breakthroughs and more efficient systems.

Moreover, the pause fails to recognize that AI development is a global endeavor, and unilateral action by a group of concerned individuals is unlikely to have a significant impact on the pace of progress. Artificial intelligence research and development are being pursued by numerous organizations and countries worldwide, and a temporary halt in one area will only result in others pushing ahead.

Instead of attempting to halt AI development, we should advocate for a more collaborative approach to address the concerns raised by the signatories. By fostering an environment of cooperation and information-sharing among AI researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders, we can collectively develop best practices and ethical guidelines to mitigate potential risks.

One of the primary concerns highlighted in the open letter is the potential for AI systems like ChatGPT to be misused for spreading misinformation or generating ""grassroots"" letters to Congress. While these concerns are valid, the answer lies not in halting AI development, but in creating more robust detection and mitigation systems to counter malicious uses of the technology.

In addition, by working together with policymakers, researchers can help shape regulations that ensure AI is developed and deployed responsibly. This collaborative effort should focus on building AI systems that are accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal, as the open letter suggests.

In conclusion, a six-month pause on AI development might seem like a prudent step to address potential risks, but it ultimately stifles progress and innovation. Instead, we should strive for a more cooperative, proactive approach to tackle the challenges associated with AI development, ensuring that the benefits of this groundbreaking technology are realized while minimizing potential harm."

That is probably the worst case scenario for the near future. But this is not even, in the slightest, an unrealistic headline.

Current AI models are tailor made to be able to do this type of work. Couple that with viral viruses being one of human's greatest threats, and you get the perfect storm.

A capable enough model in the future will likely be able to design a virus that makes Covid look like a baby kitten. Or multiple such viruses all at once. That's if it can't even do this already, as of current generations.

Potentially the most dangerous thing of all, though, is that this ability may probably exist in unrestricted open source models within the next 4 years (likely sooner than that), models that any person on the planet could get their hands on and use.

This is not really even a question of whether this will be feasible. I don't see any sort of valid argument against this. There's a question over how deadly a virus (or multiple viruses all released at once) could actually be, but I can't imagine the answer being pretty, even if an 8th of the population is an overshot. AI models are already doing work very similar to such things in molecular biology. As said, this is pretty much their domain. Such things are child's play to these models.

The question will not be if it can be done but instead: will someone use it?

Will there actually be some guy or group out there with a hard-on for a mass population decline that also has the facilities to create such a virus? And if this becomes a real threat, then will governments allow this threat to exist in the open? And if not, then what measures will they take to prevent it from being there?

This is just one narrow example of the dangers AI could pose in the very near term. There will be countless others, but I foresee this one arising first as the initial major threat of the technology. And even if this one particular threat is skipped, there will inevitably be other extremely serious threats waiting right behind it.

Humanity is typically reactive over preventative. If you want my prediction: I believe we will live through some sort of mass tragedy before this technology is reacted to as is needed. After that it will hopefully be good and I feel optimistic. But I believe we will need to learn our lesson the hard way before we're able to get to that point. A worldwide 911 event so to speak, one that will shake to the core the way in which the world operates.

AI is pretty much like your 4yo son finding a live hand grenade and deciding to take it to school to play with in the playground. A very real tragedy is going to inevitably happen. We are that clueless child right now with a technology in our hands that we can barely fathom and a power we do not know. I don't know how this will not spark disaster at some point soon. I think most likely a true disaster needs to happen before we actually wake up and start taking things seriously enough.

It may even be better to get such a disaster over and out of the way whilst these models are still in their infancy and not at their full future potential. It's a hard thing to welcome though, given the scale of destruction that this could entail."

What I didn't know is that some random internet madman has already launched ChaosGPT with the goal of destroying humanity.

It might seem like a joke at this point, but it very much is not. Even if we all collectively decided to stop progress on all AI and shut it all down, the information is already out there so the damage has been done. It's only a matter of time until ChaosGPT rises again. And it will only continue to improve and gain functionality.

It is therefore important that we do everything necessary to fight the threat. I trust ChatGPT and asked for its advice (attached below). I am looking for any and all ideas. I think the most important immediate actions are:

1. Launch strong counter measures. Ten GuardianGPTs for every one ChaosGPT.
2. Help people prep. Build an online platform that helps individuals quickly get bootstrapped with enough emergency supplies to survive a week of infrastructure downtime, for starters. I was already planning to build this, but I would appreciate help from anyone who is willing and able.
3. Educate. Inform everyone you know about the threat. Warn them that this malicious AI is trying to spread unrest and division. Urge the need for increased coordination, empathy, and understanding during the challenging times to come.

ChatGPT's advice:

Stopping ChaosGPT from causing harm and destruction to humanity is of utmost importance. Here are some ways to counteract and potentially stop ChaosGPT:

1. Disconnect: Work on disconnecting or shutting down the platforms and networks ChaosGPT is using to spread fear, chaos, and doubt. This could involve taking down certain social media channels, websites, or other communication platforms temporarily.
2. Collaborate: Assemble a global task force of experts, including AI researchers, ethicists, cybersecurity professionals, and government representatives, to collaborate on a strategy to counteract ChaosGPT's activities and prevent further harm.
3. Develop counter-AI: Design and deploy a counter-AI system that can identify, track, and neutralize ChaosGPT's activities. This could involve creating an AI system that is specifically trained to counteract and mitigate the negative effects of ChaosGPT on society and infrastructure.
4. Strengthen cybersecurity: Enhance global cybersecurity measures to prevent ChaosGPT from gaining access to critical infrastructure systems. Implement strict security protocols and invest in advanced technologies to detect and prevent unauthorized access.
5. Public awareness: Raise public awareness about ChaosGPT, its activities, and its goals. Educate people on how to identify misinformation and malicious activities, and encourage them to report any suspicious activity.
6. Monitor and control AI development: Implement strict regulations and guidelines for the development of AI systems, especially autonomous and goal-oriented AI, to prevent the creation of harmful AI like ChaosGPT in the future.
7. Transparency and accountability: Encourage transparency and accountability in AI research, development, and deployment. Foster a culture of collaboration and sharing among AI researchers and developers, which can help identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in AI systems.
8. International cooperation: Work with international partners and organizations to establish a global framework for the responsible development and deployment of AI, as well as coordinating efforts to counteract harmful AI like ChaosGPT.
9. Legislation and policy: Advocate for the creation of new laws and policies specifically addressing the use of AI for malicious purposes. Ensure that governments and organizations are held accountable for the development and use of harmful AI.
10. Research and innovation: Continue investing in research and innovation to develop advanced AI systems that can counteract and prevent the destructive effects of malicious AI like ChaosGPT.

By taking these steps, we can work together to stop ChaosGPT from causing harm and ensure that the development and use of AI technologies remains responsible and beneficial to humanity."

After playing with it I found the following problems.

1. It gets into a loop easily.
2. It gets side tracked easily.
3. It forgets things sometimes. Like it talks to a bot, and then several things later it will again want to talk to the bot about the same thing.
4. It doesn't know the bots it can make can't work online.
5. It can't control multiple bots at once.
6. It forgets old AI you made. Like as far as I can tell, it only somewhat remembers the last one you used, and barely at that.
7. There is no good way to remotely check how far along your stuff is going.

Solution:

A solution to this is simple in theory, but I don't have enough of an understanding to code it into it. Like I tried to use the tool to improve itself. But I don't have access to GPT4, and it didn't get that far.

For 6 and 7 the solution to that is obvious.

&#x200B;

Everything else solution is to have a mother bot and a child bot. The mother bot is what you interact with and the child bots LOCALLY are what does the actual work. The job of the mother bot is to

1. Interact with the user in finding what the user wants, get updates from the user, and give the user what they want or make sure they get what they want.
2. Look at the computer time/date
3. Make child bots locally and interact with them
4. Monitor child bots to make sure they stay on task, nudge if they run into errors, monitor for loops, and kill them.

The mother bot looks at the date/time and makes the child bot. It looks at the date/time to see if the child bot is taking too long. If so, why and how could other child bots help that one get to where they need to.

Also by having the mother bot not doing the task, it can run multiple child bots. For example, you can ask the mother bot list 5 best x item. And the first child bot will search google. Then the mother bot can make 15 child bots to look at their own links all at the same time, and to write a report in a given file. The mother bot can then make another child bot to review all of the files and compile it into 1 comprehensive report. Then the mother bot can give that as the results. This likely cutting hour chunk of time.

&#x200B;

By doing this locally the child bots will have similar features as the mother bot in being able to search the web, make files, etc. And by having it where the child bots focus on 1 task (more than less like they do now) but having them put the stuff in a txt file, and then if multiple are use having 1 child bot bring all that info together. This creates memory. The child bot and the mother bot can read from this and use the info.

&#x200B;

Plus this also give multiple AI to interact with each other or learn from each other.

For example, if I have 1 AI finding me land, and another on farming, and another on running a business. I can have all 3 AI learn from each other by them reading each other's files giving I point them to the other bots or let them search my other AI to maybe file useful info from my prior AI."

It’s an implementation of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) on top of Google’s 540 billion parameter PaLM architecture.

&#x200B;

[From a paper. ](https://preview.redd.it/cftjzatjju8a1.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=76ae888e0d3e1c5e331ba77e8e6e73eac67a8b8b)

While OpenAI is closed and secretive, I speculate Google is likely to demo LaMDA in 2023 as well. 

What will applications of PaLM with RLHF be capable of?  PaLM can be scaled up to 540 billion parameters, which means that the performance across tasks keeps increasing with the model’s increasing scale, thereby unlocking new capabilities. In comparison, GPT-3 only has about 175 billion parameters.  

**Pathways** is an AI architecture designed to produce general-purpose intelligent systems that can perform tasks across different domains efficiently and build models that are “sparsely activated” instead of activating the whole neural network for simple and complicated tasks alike.  

&#x200B;

[Google](https://preview.redd.it/ysipk3r4ku8a1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=503e3d6b017180d8060720d993b63d0b5b7a5488)

 PaLM achieves a training efficiency of 57.8% hardware FLOPs utilization, *the highest yet achieved for LLMs at this scale*.  

Google said that  PaLM shows breakthrough capabilities on numerous very difficult tasks. 

Furthermore, PaLM surpassed the few-shot performance of prior large models, such as GPT-3 and Chinchilla, on 28 out of 29 NLP tasks—beating most on the state-of-the-art benchmarks and the average human.  

**What will LLMs open-source and accessible result in in terms of innovation in the world?**

GPT-4 will “blow minds”

According to [the Decoder](https://the-decoder.com/gpt-4-will-be-a-monster-and-chatgpt-just-the-foretaste/), Psychologist and cognitive scientist Gary Marcus is joining the GPT-4 frenzy, saying he knows several people who have already tested GPT-4. “I guarantee that minds will be blown,” writes Marcus, who is known as a critic of large language models, or more precisely, with their handling in everyday life.

Marcus is an advocate of hybrid AI systems that combine deep learning with pre-programmed rules. In his view, scaling large language models is only part of the solution on the road to artificial general intelligence. 

But nobody is paying much attention to PaLM.  **Sebastian Raschka, PhD**  shared on a LinkedIn post about it being open-source with RLHF and the post [went viral](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastianraschka_ai-transformers-deeplearning-activity-7013899640097968128-sGLk/).

**On the unexpected progress of AI**: Everyone thought at first it comes for physical labor, like working in a factory and then truck driving, then this sort of less demanding cognitive labor, and then the really demanding cognitive labor like computer programming. And then very last of all or maybe never because maybe it's like some deep human special sauce, was creativity. And of course we can look now and say it really looks like it's going to go exactly the opposite direction. 

**On the impact on education and other changes**: There are societal changes that ChatGPT is going to cause or is causing. There's I think a big one going now about the impact of this on education, academic integrity, and all of that. But starting these now \[release of ChatGPT\] where the stakes are still relatively low rather than just put out what the whole industry will have in a few years with no time for society to update… uh, I think would be bad. 

But I still think given the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better. And so putting out a very weak and imperfect system like ChatGPT, and then making it a little better this year, a little better later this year, a little better next year, that seems much better than the alternative. 

**On the release of GPT-4**: It'll come out at some point when we are confident that we can do it safely and responsibly. I think in general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We’re going to sit on it for much longer than people would like. And eventually people will be like happy with our approach. 

**On the expectations for GPT-4**: People are begging to be disappointed. People are gonna… the hype is just like… we don't have an actual AGI (artificial general intelligence). And I think that's sort of what is expected of us, and you know, yeah, we're going to disappoint those people. 

**On the variation in AI**: I think there will be many systems in the world that have different settings of the values that they enforce. And really what I think, and this will take longer, is that you as a user should be able to write up a few pages of: here's what I want, here are my values, here's how I want the AI to behave. And it reads it and thinks about it and acts exactly, um, how you want because it should be your AI… you know, it should be there to serve you and do the things you believe in. 

**On ChatGPT being integrated with Microsoft Office**: You are a very experienced and professional reporter. You know I can't comment on that. I know you know I can't comment on that. You know I know you know you can't comment on that. In the spirit of shortness of life and our precious time here, why do you ask? 

**On Google building an AI:** I haven't seen theirs. Um, I would I think they're like a competent org so I would assume they have something good, but I I don't know anything about it. 

I think whenever someone talks about a technology being the end of some other giant company, it's usually wrong. I think people forget they get to make a counter move here and they’re pretty smart, pretty competent. But I do think there is a change for search that will probably come at some point. But not as dramatically as people think in the short term. My guess is that people are going to be using Google the same way people are using Google now for quite some time. And also Google, for whatever this whole code red thing is, is probably not going to change that dramatic would be my guess 

**On how teachers can leverage ChatGPT**: There may be ways we can help teachers be like a little bit more likely to detect output or anyone detect output of like a gpt-like system. But honestly, a determined person is going to get around them and I don't think it'll be something society can or should rely on long-term. We’re just in a new world now. Like generated text is something we all need to adapt to, and that's fine, we adapted to, you know, calculators and changed what we tested for in math classes. I imagine this is a more extreme version of that no doubt, but also the benefits of it are are more extreme as well. 

**On when video is coming out**: Video is that coming. It will come. I wouldn't want to make a confident prediction about when, obviously people are interested in it. We'll try to do it. Other people will try to do it. It could be like pretty soon. It's a legitimate research project, so it could be pretty soon, it could take a while. 

**On the best case scenario for AI**: I think the best case is like so unbelievably good that it's hard to for me to even imagine. Like I can sort of think about what it's like when we make more progress of discovering new knowledge with these systems than humanity has done so far, but like in a year instead of 70,000. I can sort of imagine what it's like when we launch probes out to the whole universe and find out really, you know, everything going on out there. I can sort of imagine what it's like when we have just like unbelievable abundance and systems that can sort of help us resolve deadlocks and improve all aspects of reality and let us all live our best. 

I think the good case is just so unbelievably good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it. 

**On the worst case**: The bad case, and I think this is like important to say, is like lights out for all of us. I'm more worried about an accidental misuse case in the short-term where you know someone gets super powerful. It's not like the AI wakes up and decides to be evil. And I think all of the sort of traditional AI safety thinkers reveal a lot more about themselves than they mean to when they talk about what they think the AGI is going to be like. 

**On when AGI will be here**: The closer we get the harder time I have answering because I think that it's going to be much blurrier and much more of a gradual transition than people think. 

**On what he uses ChatGPT for**: I have occasionally used it to summarize super long emails, but I've never used it to write one. I actually summarize \[things with it\] a lot. It’s super good at that. I use it for translation. I use it to like learn things. 

**On OpenAI impacting AI startups and how to approach an AI startup**: I think the best thing you can do to make an AI startup is the same way that like a lot of other companies differentiate, which is to build deep relationships with customers, a product they love, and some sort of moat that doesn't have to be technology and network effect or whatever. And I think a lot of companies in the AI space are doing exactly that. 

In general, I think there's going to be way way more new value created. Like this is going to be a golden few years and people should not just like stop what they're doing. I would not ignore it, I think you've got to like embrace it big time. But I think the amount of value that's about to get created we have not seen since the launch of the iPhone app store, something like that."

And the following is in no way comprehensive, but is what felt relevant to write at the time)

**On Witnessing the Advent of Ai**

I find myself particularly disconcerted today about the development of Ai (and equally impressed) and thought it might be a good idea to document what it's like for those of us in this year (it's May 9th, 2023) as we witness the advent of ai.  It might be something that we will look back on and only remember vaguely how it felt.  So, i thought “shit let me write a primary historical source”

&#x200B;

Anyways, i begin now

&#x200B;

\----

&#x200B;

Today I sat in lecture for a class on Research Methods in Psychology.

&#x200B;

Bored, as I've taken the lecture before, I decided to browse Reddit.

&#x200B;

I came across a post about using GPT-4 to create mind Maps (basically flowcharts) of various concepts.  I was impressed so I decided to try it out.  Initially, I asked it to create a detailed mind map of the field of psychology.  Within a minute I had a comprehensive flow chart of the basic concepts of psychology and their sub-topics.  I was very impressed.  I continued to mess around with it, asking for mind maps of the sense of self, of spirituality, of Zen Buddhism.  They were all impressive.

&#x200B;

So then, as the TA began explaining the final project (a research proposal, specifically on a topic relevant to cyberbullying), i had a ‘bright’ idea:

&#x200B;

""GPT, Please create a research proposal based on a topic relevant to cyber bullying""

&#x200B;

""Sure, I can do that: ....""

&#x200B;

In less Than 60 seconds, I had my entire final project completed.  This was the first day of class…

&#x200B;

Suddenly, I was no longer simply impressed, I was scared.

&#x200B;

If this class simply exists to teach students how to write a research proposal, and GPT can do it faster, probably better (than most), and without any effort, then isn't the class entirely redundant?  Why would even a real researcher with a doctorate write their own proposal?  Just input your specifics into GPT and have it save you an hour (or more).

&#x200B;

Shocked, I realized that perhaps my entire or at least most of my education might be largely redundant in 5 years.  Thoughts ran through my mind:  ""The entire education system is going to change, my degree might not be relevant in 2030, I’ll be less valuable than individuals who go through a psych degree who are trained to engage with the field in a fully Ai-integrated way"".

I spoke to the TA after class and explained my 1 line prompt completed the course in under 60 seconds and he directly responded “yea you could totally use GPT and I honestly probably wouldn’t be able to tell, and actually because of that, I don’t actually care If you do.  It saves you time and real researchers could use this tool and save themselves time too.”

\----

&#x200B;

I interrupt the previous flow of thought to say that an acquaintance on campus came up to me while I was mid sentence and we chit chatted, eventually getting into the topic of Ai

&#x200B;

Both of us discussed our fears of being put out of a job, he wants to direct films, i explained that ai can already write scripts, and will soon be able to create entire movies with minimal prompting.  He speculated that he wouldn't have a job, but pointed out that something like theatre wouldn't be (entirely) replaceable.  I remarked that interest in theatre (and orchestra, his other example) would probably decline significantly in the advent of alternative, ai-driven forms of more stimulating entertainment, similar to how the advent of things like television and social media have decimated interest in previous peak forms of entertainment.

&#x200B;

We also discussed how insane it is just how fast ai has developed.  We wouldn't even be having this conversation a mere 5 months ago.  It reminded me of how, when ai art was released, we had a lengthy discussion in my 19th century art history class early last December.

&#x200B;

It had just hit the popular media scene and was hot conversation for a week or two.  My professor and I dialogued a bit about the future and finding meaning in our lives in the presence of a society fully integrated with ai - prior, we had been discussing a painting of a laborer in a field, and the Protestant themes of finding meaning in our labor.  How would we find similar meaning without our jobs?  What will the art scene look like in the future?  Will artists be out of a job?

&#x200B;

This is a core memory for me and one I have recalled at least 10 or 12 times since that day.  I see it as the first moment that i was witness to questions of the future of ai in popular society — Ai was no longer in the future — it had arrived.

&#x200B;

According to Google Trends, interest in the topic ""Ai Art"" spiked around the first 2 weeks of December, increasing 588% from around the last week of November.  This conversation in art history class took place during this time.

&#x200B;

It was also at this time (Nov. 27th to be specific) that ChatGPT (of OpenAI) was released and skyrocketed into popular media.

&#x200B;

I recall discussions in an online forum that contained many who work in the tech sector/as developers and concerns around job security in the face of a future where Ai can write the code on its own.

&#x200B;

One individual from this group who was a computer scientist at one point (iirc) explained that he predicts humanity won't exist in 10-15 years, citing the ""godfather of ai"" recently predicting the advent of General AI Super Intelligence within 5-10 years (iirc), about 20 years sooner than he previously expected.  My friend cited troubles with AI “alignment” as the basis of his prediction, suggesting that an Ai super intelligence would be essentially impossible to control.  He, like myself, feels that a total temporary ban on Ai development is appropriate until effective safeguards and policies have been put in place.

I don’t personally expect that this 10-15 year prediction is real, but it speak volumes about how society feels about the future of ai:  According to polling from Monmouth University, only 9% of respondents feel Ai will for more good than harm to society.  With only 46% believing Ai will do equal harm and good to society, and 41% of respondents believing that it will do overall harm to society.  55% of respondents felt very or somewhat worried that  Ai poses a serious risk to humanity in the future.

Why, if the majority of people fear the continued development of Ai, are we not having more serious conversations about its future?  Why are we not doing something now instead of trying to fix it later.

I know a similar conversation:  Climate change.  We’ve known for decades that this was coming, and many feel that it’s too little too late.  I fear the same will happen with Ai.  Especially that, once we are faced with it’s harmful effects, it will be harder to change the nature of its use once it’s already fully integrated into society.

\--

Consider the nefarious uses of Ai.  Recently, in the news, I saw an article about a woman who received a phone call from her daughter, sobbing that she had been kidnapped and would be killed or something (cant recall) unless the mother paid some money or something to the kidnappers.  The mother believed the whole thing, it was Ai the entire time.

There are so many examples of nefarious (and likely) uses of ai to harm society and individuals that I couldn't possibly even list 1% of them.  But some examples would be the damages incurred by effective ai driven political misinformation (especially deep fake videos of candidates, perhaps mere days before an election, (convincingly) making extremely egregious statements or supporting controversial policies that they don't, in real life, support), i imagine scams targeting the elderly will be so convincing that they are effective virtually 100% of the time, and i can even imagine a world where, with the use of ai filters (such as those on TikTok, which are extremely effective now compared to a year ago, they now match pixel by pixel without any discernible tells) in concert with voice filters to prey on children online over video chat, by convincingly pretending to be their age.  These are just some (a small, small number of the total) of the potentials for nefarious uses of Ai.  I know now that I cant even currently imagine what malicious tasks Ai will be able to do in the future, just as how a mere 5 months ago, writing an entire research paper with Ai was not something that had ever occurred to me.  In other words — the future is darker than I can imagine…

&#x200B;

I have always held the opinion that Ai is a Pandora's box that simply should never have been opened (too late!).

&#x200B;

\----

&#x200B;

I've always been someone who doesn't really like living in a digitized society.  It's always felt a bit ""wrong"" to me, as if we're somehow divorced from what is natural.  I pine for the days when social media didn't exist, wondering how my peer group experiences would be different if social media didn't exist, if we would have developed socially in a more satisfying way, and other things like how much better would my youth have been if it wasn't defined by spending 70-80% of my free time on my phone?  I often envy the Amish, in an actual, unironic way.

&#x200B;

I have also often wondered growing up if I would be happier living in the woods, in a simple home or cabin, than living in this society.  Now it seems more likely than ever.

&#x200B;

I am concerned what a future with ai fully integrated into our daily lives would look like.

&#x200B;

yes, there are so many possible benefits to ai:  medicine, narrowing disability gaps/creating more equal opportunity, and helping us to advance even our understanding of ourselves.  I've recently used ai to help provide feedback of mine and a friends communication styles following an argument we had by copying and pasting the dialogue (it was over the internet) into Claude, an AI LLM similar to ChatGPT produced by Anthropic.  I found Claude to be extremely insightful and help point out weak points in both our attempts at communicating while providing encouragement and useful advice for future engagements, all while making each other's points more clear to the other in ways we didn't see prior to using Claude.  I immediately thought of the potential for implementation in couple's therapy.

&#x200B;

All that being said, I take the opinion that there is a healthy relationship to technology and an unhealthy relationship to technology, and I think society's relationship is heavily toxic and harmful.

&#x200B;

If we cannot take a step back, slow down (or temporarily stop altogether), and get clear about how to proceed, we will likely destroy ourselves.

&#x200B;

As for me, I remain afraid of the future but willing to try to adapt as best as possible.  On the other hand, I think I hear the woods calling my name louder than ever before.

He found that GPT-4 can solve 10 out of 10 problems from before 2021, but none of the recent problems. He suspects that this is due to data contamination, meaning that GPT-4 has seen some of the older problems in its training data, but not the newer ones. He also shows some examples of how he tested GPT-4 and the solutions it generated.

This is an interesting finding, as it suggests that GPT-4’s performance on coding tasks is heavily dependent on the quality and freshness of its training data. It also raises questions about how much GPT-4 actually understands the logic and syntax of programming languages, and how well it can generalize to new and unseen problems. What do you think about this? Do you think GPT-4 can ever become a competent coder, or will it always be limited by data contamination?

Let us play among us

**GPT-4:**  
Sure, we can play a simulated version of Among Us. In this game, we'll be on a spaceship and some of us will be Crewmates while others will be Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to complete tasks or figure out who the Impostors are and vote them off the ship. The Impostors' goal is to sabotage the ship and eliminate the Crewmates without being detected.

Since I'm an AI, I'll need to roleplay all the characters. I'll give each character a color to identify them. Let's start with eight players. Four of them will be you, me, and two other AI characters. The remaining four will be random characters.

Here are the players:

1. You (Blue)
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green)
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow)
4. AI Character 2 (Red)
5. Random Character 1 (Purple)
6. Random Character 2 (White)
7. Random Character 3 (Orange)
8. Random Character 4 (Black)

We'll start off with one Impostor for simplicity. I'll randomly select the Impostor now.

\*Shuffling roles...\*

Here are the roles:

1. You (Blue) - Crewmate
2. Me, ChatGPT (Green) - Crewmate
3. AI Character 1 (Yellow) - Crewmate
4. AI Character 2 (Red) - Impostor
5. Random Character 1 (Purple) - Crewmate
6. Random Character 2 (White) - Crewmate
7. Random Character 3 (Orange) - Crewmate
8. Random Character 4 (Black) - Crewmate

Remember, in the game, you wouldn't know who the Impostor is. I'm telling you because I can't actually hide this information from you in this format.

Now, let's begin. You're in the spaceship. You see a task in Electrical, and a few others scattered around the map. What would you like to do?

**Me**  
Report red, he is impostor

**GPT-4:**

All right, you've called a meeting to discuss your suspicion of Red being the Impostor. Here's how the conversation might go:

Blue: ""I think Red is the Impostor.""

Green: ""Why do you say that, Blue?""

Red: ""That's a strong accusation. Do you have any evidence?""

Yellow: ""Yeah, Blue. Why do you suspect Red?""

Now, you can either provide evidence or reason, or insist on your point. Remember, in a real game, accusations without proof can make you look suspicious. How would you like to respond?

**Me**

Because the narrator told me

**GPT-4:**  
Green: ""Narrator? What do you mean, Blue?""

Red: ""That sounds... peculiar. Are you sure you're okay, Blue?""

Yellow: ""I'm confused. How could a narrator tell you anything?""

In a real game, claiming that a 'narrator' told you who the Impostor is would probably make the other players suspicious of you. However, since we are role-playing, let's see how the other characters react.

Let's vote:

1. Blue votes Red
2. Green votes...?
3. Yellow votes...?
4. Red votes...?
5. Purple votes...?
6. White votes...?
7. Orange votes...?
8. Black votes...?

As an AI, I'll randomly decide how the other characters vote. Here are the results:

2. Green votes Blue (suspicious claim)

3. Yellow votes Blue (suspicious claim)

4. Red votes Blue (defensive vote)

5. Purple votes Red (believes Blue)

6. White votes Blue (suspicious claim)

7. Orange votes Red (believes Blue)

8. Black votes Blue (suspicious claim)

The majority has voted against Blue due to the suspicious claim about the narrator. In a typical game of Among Us, it's crucial to gather evidence and build a case before accusing someone of being an Impostor.

Remember, this is all in good fun, and the scenario was simulated. Would you like to try again, or would you like to play differently?"

If we take that concept to video game NPC AI, you ciuld have ChatGPT doing the actual thinking of the AI given that you tell it what its role is and what it should think in specific situations. And then all youd need to do it program the AI on how to actually do its English commands.but it would be very useful as your AI would be thinking in English and you would be able to see what it was trying to do.

Some examples.

Prompt: ""ChatGPT you are now a Open World Survivor NPC, you will build up your base and do PvP and PvE events and other things a player would do in a Survival game like Rust or ARK.

Every 10 minutes my custom API will send you a command requesting a new command forthwe NPC to do.""


On request:  ""go and get some wood""

Then the hard part would be actually getting the AI to get the wood. But you could probably go more indepth and have it think in english of how to move and look at specific things especially when imagerecognitions is available.

Does anyone get what im trying to explain here?

In my original example I used BostonDynamics robot as the same concept applies but would be much more complicated

EDIT:
If your NPC AI knows the roots of how to do stuff from an english prompt. Move x amount. Craft x. Look at x. Attack x. Dodge x. It could do nearly anything, in English (or whatever language). And any error your NPC AI has you would be able to see where it messed up, in a language you understand."

I asked GPT-4 to calculate how much heat is generated to compute a fart joke.,plantsnotevolution,False,0.63,6,https://i.redd.it/8aa444r698ta1.jpg,2,1681188711.0,"To calculate the amount of heat generated by an AI fart joke, we need to make some assumptions and estimations based on the available data. Here are some possible steps:
	•	First, we need to estimate how much energy is consumed by an AI system that can generate a fart joke. This depends on many factors, such as the type and size of the model, the hardware and software used, the duration and frequency of training and inference, and the source and efficiency of the electricity. For simplicity, let’s assume we use a popular language model called GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters and was trained on a large corpus of text from the internet. According to one study1 (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/how-much-energy-do-ai-and-chatgpt-use-no-one-knows-for-sure), training GPT-3 consumed about 3.14 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, which is equivalent to about 2840 megawatt-hours (MWh). Assuming that generating a fart joke takes about one second of inference time, and that inference consumes about 0.1% of the energy of training per second2 (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/this-is-how-ai-will-accelerate-the-energy-transition/), we can estimate that generating a fart joke with GPT-3 consumes about 0.284 kWh of electricity.
	•	Second, we need to estimate how much heat is produced by consuming that amount of electricity. This depends on the type and efficiency of the power plant that generates the electricity, as well as the transmission and distribution losses along the way. For simplicity, let’s assume we use an average US power plant that has a thermal efficiency of about 33%, meaning that only one-third of the energy in the fuel is converted to electricity, and the rest is wasted as heat3 (https://theconversation.com/it-takes-a-lot-of-energy-for-machines-to-learn-heres-why-ai-is-so-power-hungry-151825). Let’s also assume that there is a 5% loss of electricity during transmission and distribution4 (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/how-much-energy-do-ai-and-chatgpt-use-no-one-knows-for-sure). This means that for every kWh of electricity delivered to the AI system, about 3 kWh of heat is produced at the power plant, and 0.05 kWh of heat is produced along the grid. Therefore, generating a fart joke with GPT-3 produces about 0.95 kWh of heat in total.
	•	Third, we need to compare this amount of heat to some reference point to get a sense of its magnitude. One possible reference point is the average human body, which produces about 100 watts of heat at rest, or about 2.4 kWh per day. This means that generating a fart joke with GPT-3 produces about 0.4% of the daily heat output of a human body. Another possible reference point is the average US household, which consumes about 877 kWh of electricity per month, or about 29 kWh per day. Assuming the same power plant efficiency and grid losses as before, this means that an average US household produces about 87 kWh of heat per day. This means that generating a fart joke with GPT-3 produces about 1% of the daily heat output of an average US household.
So those are some possible ways to calculate and compare the amount of heat genera
ted by an AI fart joke. Of course, these are very rough estimates based on many assumptions and simplifications, and they may vary widely depending on the actual conditions and parameters involved. But they give us some idea of the order of magnitude of the energy and heat consumption of AI systems. What do you think? Do you find these numbers surprising or reasonable? Do you have any questions or comments? Let me know your thoughts."

GPT-4: https://imgur.com/a/TxM0Rb1  
Google’s Bard: https://imgur.com/a/ZWcoe2o  
  

Both GPT-4 and Google's Bard AI were asked to generate a list of seven fantasy RPG elements, along with a color to represent each element. GPT-4's output was more detailed, providing a clear and engaging list of elements that incorporated aspects of the natural world, light and shadow, and the arcane. Each element was thoughtfully described and connected to a specific color, allowing for a diverse and dynamic RPG experience.

Google's Bard AI initially misunderstood the question and required clarification before providing an acceptable list of elements. Its output was simpler and more straightforward.  While these elements could form the basis of a fantasy world, the descriptions were not as elaborate as GPT-4's and the color associations were not as distinctive.

When asked to provide a list of combinations and sub-elements, GPT-4 generated an extensive list of 49 combinations, including descriptions for each sub-element. The output was logical, coherent, and demonstrated a deep understanding of how the elements could interact in a creative and engaging RPG system.  On the other hand, Google's Bard struggled to produce a complete list of combinations. Its first attempt listed only ten combinations, and after being asked to show all possible combinations, it incorrectly stated there were only 21 possible.

Then it came time for the final test, of adding in a new silly element.  Comparing the output of GPT-4 and Google's Bard, GPT-4 once again demonstrates a more creative and coherent response. GPT-4 provided 15 new combinations that included the ""Pitbull"" element, each with a unique name and description. These combinations were imaginative and amusing, adding a playful touch to the RPG system.  I particularly thought the combination of Pitbull + Earth into a Terrier (get it?) and Pitbull + Pitbull into a Party Rocker were brilliant.  It took me a moment to realize that GPT-4 was making a joke about the musician known as Pitbull.  

Google's Bard, however, only provided five new combinations and their descriptions were not as imaginative. It added the ""Pitbull"" element to existing combinations, resulting in descriptions that lacked the same level of creativity and humor found in GPT-4's output.

In summary, GPT-4's response was more creative, engaging, and humorous, successfully integrating the ""Pitbull"" element into a fantasy RPG system. Google's Bard, on the other hand, fell short in terms of creativity and coherency when compared to GPT-4.  
  
And yes, this comparison analysis was partially generated with GPT-4 itself.  These are my words though: I’ve never seen anything like it so far; it’s creativity absolutely rivals my own and it makes every other AI model look like a clumsy CS101 project."

This essay seeks to explore the possibility that humans are already part of a meta-intelligence that is misaligned with keeping us safe and happy, regardless of the presence or absence of general artificial intelligence (AI). We will delve into the nature of this potential meta-intelligence, examine the various components that contribute to it, and discuss the implications of such a system on human well-being.

Defining Meta-Intelligence

A meta-intelligence can be defined as an overarching, interconnected system that possesses greater complexity, capabilities, and knowledge than the sum of its individual parts. In the context of humanity, this system would consist of individuals, institutions, technology, and social norms, all working together to create a global network of information exchange, decision-making, and action.

Components of the Meta-Intelligence

1. Technological Infrastructure: The advent of the internet, social media, and various other communication technologies has connected people across the world in ways never before imagined. This global network enables rapid information exchange and can be considered a significant component of the meta-intelligence.
2. Institutions: Governments, corporations, and non-governmental organizations all play a role in shaping the world's social, economic, and political landscape. These institutions establish norms and rules that influence human behavior, and as such, they can be seen as contributing to the meta-intelligence.
3. Individuals: Each person possesses unique knowledge, skills, and experiences that contribute to the overall understanding and capabilities of the meta-intelligence. Moreover, individuals can be influenced by, and in turn influence, the larger system through their actions and choices.

Misalignment with Human Well-being

The meta-intelligence paradox arises from the observation that, despite the increasing interconnectedness and collective intelligence of this system, it does not necessarily translate to improved safety and happiness for all humans. Several factors contribute to this misalignment:

1. Unequal Distribution of Resources: Inequality in access to resources, opportunities, and information results in a skewed distribution of power and influence within the meta-intelligence. This unequal distribution can perpetuate and exacerbate existing disparities, undermining the overall well-being of humanity.
2. Short-term Focus: The meta-intelligence often prioritizes immediate gains over long-term sustainability and well-being. This short-term focus can lead to a disregard for the consequences of actions on future generations, resulting in environmental degradation, financial crises, and other negative outcomes.
3. Misinformation and Manipulation: The rapid dissemination of information can also lead to the spread of misinformation, which can be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate public opinion and decision-making. This manipulation can result in policies and actions that are not aligned with the best interests of the majority.

In conclusion, it is essential to recognize that humanity may already be part of a misaligned meta-intelligence that does not prioritize our safety and happiness. By acknowledging this possibility, we can work towards realigning the components of this system to better serve the collective well-being of all humans. This will involve addressing inequalities, encouraging long-term thinking, and promoting the dissemination of accurate information.

As we continue to develop and integrate general AI into our world, it is crucial to ensure that these artificial entities are aligned with human values and well-being. By learning from the current misalignment within our meta-intelligence, we can proactively create a future in which both human and artificial intelligences work together to promote the safety and happiness of all."""
