Our team has worked tirelessly over the past several months collecting large amounts of text-based input and feedback to create an incredibly diverse and unique dataset designed specifically for training language models or other AI applications.

With over 600k human-generated data points covering a wide range of topics and styles of writing, our dataset will be an invaluable tool for any developer looking to create state-of-the-art instruction models!

To make things even better, we are making this entire dataset free and accessible to all who wish to use it. Check it out today at our HF org: OpenAssistant

On top of that, we've trained very powerful models that you can try right now at: [open-assistant.io/chat](https://open-assistant.io/chat) !"

I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

I do **not** count alternative **frontend** projects because they just call the API from OpenAI. 
I do **not** consider alternative **transformer decoder** to GPT 3.5 either because the training data of them are (mostly) not for chat system.

> It is priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens, which is 10x cheaper than our existing GPT-3.5 models.

This is a massive, massive deal. For context, the reason GPT-3 apps took off over the past few months before ChatGPT went viral is because a) text-davinci-003 was released and was a significant performance increase and b) the cost was cut from $0.06/1k tokens to $0.02/1k tokens, which made consumer applications feasible without a large upfront cost.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

It understood the arrows pointing between table boxes on the image as relations, and even understand many to one/many to many. 

I took a picture of random writing on a page, and it did OCR better than has ever been possible. I was able to ask questions that required OCR and a geometrical understanding of the page layout.

Are open-source LLMs gonna be the future? Considering the trust issues with ChatGPT and the debates about its safety, the idea of open-source LLMs seems to be the best bet imo.

Unlike closed-source models, users can verify the privacy claims of open-source models. There have been some good things being said about Mistral, and I only hope such open source LLMs secure enough funding to compete with giants like OpenAI. Maybe then, ChatGPT will also be forced to go open source?

With that said, I'm also hopeful that competitors like [Silatus](https://silatus.com/) and [Durable](https://durable.co/), which already use multiple models, consider using open-source models like Mistral into their frameworks.

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

Any comments, inputs, rants, counter-arguments are welcome.

I am no programmer, and I have a very basic knowledge of machine learning, but I am fascinated by the possibilities offered by all the new models we have seen so far. 

Some people around me say they are not that impressed by what AIs can do, so I built a small test (with a little help by chatGPT to code the whole thing): can you always 100% distinguish between AI art or text and old works of art or literature?

Here is the site: http://aiorart.com/

I find that AI-generated text is still generally easy to spot, but of course it is very challenging to go against great literary works. AI images can sometimes be truly deceptive.

I wonder what you will all think of it... and how all that will evolve in the coming months!

Preliminary evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge shows Vicuna-13B achieves more than 90%\* quality of OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard while outperforming other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca in more than 90%\* of cases. The cost of training Vicuna-13B is around $300. The training and serving [code](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), along with an online [demo](https://chat.lmsys.org/), are publicly available for non-commercial use.

# Training details

Vicuna is created by fine-tuning a LLaMA base model using approximately 70K user-shared conversations gathered from ShareGPT.com with public APIs. To ensure data quality, we convert the HTML back to markdown and filter out some inappropriate or low-quality samples. Additionally, we divide lengthy conversations into smaller segments that fit the model’s maximum context length.

Our training recipe builds on top of [Stanford’s alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) with the following improvements.

* **Memory Optimizations:** To enable Vicuna’s understanding of long context, we expand the max context length from 512 in alpaca to 2048, which substantially increases GPU memory requirements. We tackle the memory pressure by utilizing [gradient checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174) and [flash attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135).
* **Multi-round conversations:** We adjust the training loss to account for multi-round conversations and compute the fine-tuning loss solely on the chatbot’s output.
* **Cost Reduction via Spot Instance:** The 40x larger dataset and 4x sequence length for training poses a considerable challenge in training expenses. We employ [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) [managed spot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/spot-jobs.html) to reduce the cost by leveraging the cheaper spot instances with auto-recovery for preemptions and auto zone switch. This solution slashes costs for training the 7B model from $500 to around $140 and the 13B model from around $1K to $300.

# Limitations

We have noticed that, similar to other large language models, Vicuna has certain limitations. For instance, it is not good at tasks involving reasoning or mathematics, and it may have limitations in accurately identifying itself or ensuring the factual accuracy of its outputs. Additionally, it has not been sufficiently optimized to guarantee safety or mitigate potential toxicity or bias. To address the safety concerns, we use the OpenAI [moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview) API to filter out inappropriate user inputs in our online demo. Nonetheless, we anticipate that Vicuna can serve as an open starting point for future research to tackle these limitations.

Edit:

I understand all the business reasons for this, I guess... as an end-user and a dude working in ML, I just don't really care about the business reasons.

The main part that I dislike is that GPT used to be a standard Deep Learning term from 2018-2022 (long before chatgpt) to define transformer decoder architectures trained on large volumes of next word prediction tasks. To block that token from an LLM is to make it unable to explain a pretty significant step in the history of modern LLMs.

I get to plot a histogram with the numbers and they are close to what I would consider an exponential distribution with such parameter (you can see the plot).

Given that GPT 3.5 does not have access to a Python interpreter, how on earth is it able to do so? I have also tried other distributions and parameters and it kind of works. It's not perfect, but with normal distributions it is usually close to what scipy.stats would generate.

I could understand that it can have learnt to interpret Python code to some extent, but honestly I can't find explanation for random sampling from a probability distribution. For a Normal distribution, I can tell it about the desired mean and variance, and it samples values that are more than reasonable (and close to the true mean/variance specified).

Any thoughts? I honestly am unable to wrap my head around how a LLM can have the understanding on how to sample tokens (at digit level) to fit any probability distribution. To me it seems very unlikely to have similar data either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages."

**Juergen Schmidhuber, Renowned 'Father Of Modern AI,' Says His Life’s Work Won't Lead To Dystopia**

*May 23, 2023. Contributed by [Hessie Jones](https://twitter.com/hessiejones).*

Amid the growing concern about the impact of more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on society, there are many in the technology community who fear the implications of the advancements in Generative AI if they go unchecked. Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber, a renowned scientist, artificial intelligence researcher and widely regarded as one of the pioneers in the field, is more optimistic. He declares that many of those who suddenly warn against the dangers of AI are just seeking publicity, exploiting the media’s obsession with killer robots which has attracted more attention than “good AI” for healthcare etc.

The potential to revolutionize various industries and improve our lives is clear, as are the equal dangers if bad actors leverage the technology for personal gain. Are we headed towards a dystopian future, or is there reason to be optimistic? I had a chance to sit down with Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber to understand his perspective on this seemingly fast-moving AI-train that will leap us into the future.

As a teenager in the 1970s, Juergen Schmidhuber became fascinated with the idea of creating intelligent machines that could learn and improve on their own, becoming smarter than himself within his lifetime. This would ultimately lead to his groundbreaking work in the field of deep learning.

In the 1980s, he studied computer science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he earned his diploma in 1987. His thesis was on the ultimate self-improving machines that, not only, learn through some pre-wired human-designed learning algorithm, but also learn and improve the learning algorithm itself. Decades later, this became a hot topic. He also received his Ph.D. at TUM in 1991 for work that laid some of the foundations of modern AI.

Schmidhuber is best known for his contributions to the development of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the most powerful type of artificial neural network that can process sequential data such as speech and natural language. With his students Sepp Hochreiter, Felix Gers, Alex Graves, Daan Wierstra, and others, he published architectures and training algorithms for the long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of RNN that is widely used in natural language processing, speech recognition, video games, robotics, and other applications. LSTM has become the most cited neural network of the 20th century, and Business Week called it ""[arguably the most commercial AI achievement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-15/google-amazon-and-facebook-owe-j-rgen-schmidhuber-a-fortune?leadSource=uverify%20wall).""

Throughout his career, Schmidhuber has received various awards and accolades for his groundbreaking work. In 2013, he was awarded the Helmholtz Prize, which recognizes significant contributions to the field of machine learning. In 2016, he was awarded the IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award for ""*pioneering contributions to deep learning and neural networks."" The media have often called him the “father of modern AI,*” because the [most cited neural networks](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/most-cited-neural-nets.html) all build on his lab’s work. He is quick to point out, however, that AI history [goes back centuries.](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html)

Despite his many accomplishments, at the age of 60, he feels mounting time pressure towards building an Artificial General Intelligence within his lifetime and remains committed to pushing the boundaries of AI research and development. He is currently director of the KAUST AI Initiative, scientific director of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, and co-founder and chief scientist of AI company NNAISENSE, whose motto is ""AI∀"" which is a math-inspired way of saying ""AI For All."" He continues to work on cutting-edge AI technologies and applications to improve human health and extend human lives and make lives easier for everyone.

*The following interview has been edited for clarity.*

**Jones: Thank you Juergen for joining me. You have signed letters warning about AI weapons. But you didn't sign the recent publication, ""Pause Gigantic AI Experiments: An Open Letter""? Is there a reason?**

**Schmidhuber:** Thank you Hessie. Glad to speak with you. I have realized that many of those who warn in public against the dangers of AI are just seeking publicity. I don't think the latest letter will have any significant impact because many AI researchers, companies, and governments will ignore it completely.

The proposal frequently uses the word ""we"" and refers to ""us,"" the humans. But as I have pointed out many times in the past, there is no ""we"" that everyone can identify with. Ask 10 different people, and you will hear 10 different opinions about what is ""good."" Some of those opinions will be completely incompatible with each other. Don't forget the enormous amount of conflict between the many people.

The letter also says, ""*If such a pause cannot be quickly put in place, governments should intervene and impose a moratorium.*"" The problem is that different governments have ALSO different opinions about what is good for them and for others. Great Power A will say, if we don't do it, Great Power B will, perhaps secretly, and gain an advantage over us. The same is true for Great Powers C and D.

**Jones: Everyone acknowledges this fear surrounding current generative AI technology. Moreover, the existential threat of this technology has been publicly acknowledged by** [**Sam Altman**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65616866)**, CEO of OpenAI himself, calling for AI regulation. From your perspective, is there an existential threat?**

**Schmidhuber:** It is true that AI can be weaponized, and I have no doubt that there will be all kinds of AI arms races, but AI does not introduce a new quality of existential threat. The threat coming from AI weapons seems to pale in comparison to the much older threat from nuclear hydrogen bombs that don’t need AI at all. We should be much more afraid of half-century-old tech in the form of H-bomb rockets. The Tsar Bomba of 1961 had almost 15 times more destructive power than all weapons of WW-II combined.  Despite the dramatic nuclear disarmament since the 1980s, there are still more than enough nuclear warheads to wipe out human civilization within two hours, without any AI I’m much more worried about that old existential threat than the rather harmless AI weapons.

**Jones: I realize that while you compare AI to the threat of nuclear bombs, there is a current danger that a current technology can be put in the hands of humans and enable them to “eventually” exact further harms to individuals of group in a very precise way, like targeted drone attacks. You are giving people a toolset that they've never had before, enabling bad actors, as some have pointed out, to be able to do a lot more than previously because they didn't have this technology.**

**Schmidhuber:** Now, all that sounds horrible in principle, but our existing laws are sufficient to deal with these new types of weapons enabled by AI. If you kill someone with a gun, you will go to jail. Same if you kill someone with one of these drones. Law enforcement will get better at understanding new threats and new weapons and will respond with better technology to combat these threats. Enabling drones to target persons from a distance in a way that requires some tracking and some intelligence to perform, which has traditionally been performed by skilled humans, to me, it seems is just an improved version of a traditional weapon, like a gun, which is, you know, a little bit smarter than the old guns.

But, in principle, all of that is not a new development. For many centuries, we have had the evolution of better weaponry and deadlier poisons and so on, and law enforcement has evolved their policies to react to these threats over time. So, it's not that we suddenly have a new quality of existential threat and it's much more worrisome than what we have had for about six decades. A large nuclear warhead doesn’t need fancy face recognition to kill an individual. No, it simply wipes out an entire city with ten million inhabitants.

**Jones: The existential threat that’s implied is the extent to which humans have control over this technology. We see some early cases of opportunism which, as you say, tends to get more media attention than positive breakthroughs. But you’re implying that this will all balance out?**

**Schmidhuber:** Historically, we have a long tradition of technological breakthroughs that led to advancements in weapons for the purpose of defense but also for protection. From sticks, to rocks, to axes to gunpowder to cannons to rockets… and now to drones… this has had a drastic influence on human history but what has been consistent throughout history is that those who are using technology to achieve their own ends are themselves, facing the same technology because the opposing side is learning to use it against them. And that's what has been repeated in thousands of years of human history and it will continue. I don't see the new AI arms race as something that is remotely as existential a threat as the good old nuclear warheads.

You said something important, in that some people prefer to talk about the downsides rather than the benefits of this technology, but that's misleading, because 95% of all AI research and AI development is about making people happier and advancing human life and health.

**Jones: Let’s touch on some of those beneficial advances in AI research that have been able to radically change present day methods and achieve breakthroughs.**

**Schmidhuber:** All right! For example, eleven years ago, our team with my postdoc Dan Ciresan was the first to win a [medical imaging competition through deep learning](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/first-time-deep-learning-won-medical-imaging-contest-september-2012.html). We analyzed female breast cells with the objective to determine harmless cells vs. those in the pre-cancer stage. Typically, a trained oncologist needs a long time to make these determinations. Our team, who knew nothing about cancer, were able to train an artificial neural network, which was totally dumb in the beginning, on lots of this kind of data. It was able to outperform all the other methods. Today, this is being used not only for breast cancer, but also for radiology and detecting plaque in arteries, and many other things.  Some of the neural networks that we have developed in the last 3 decades are now prevalent across thousands of healthcare applications, detecting Diabetes and Covid-19 and what not. This will eventually permeate across all healthcare. The good consequences of this type of AI are much more important than the click-bait new ways of conducting crimes with AI.

**Jones: Adoption is a product of reinforced outcomes. The massive scale of adoption either leads us to believe that people have been led astray, or conversely, technology is having a positive effect on people’s lives.**

**Schmidhuber:** The latter is the likely case. There's intense commercial pressure towards good AI rather than bad AI because companies want to sell you something, and you are going to buy only stuff you think is going to be good for you. So already just through this simple, commercial pressure, you have a tremendous bias towards good AI rather than bad AI. However, doomsday scenarios like in Schwarzenegger movies grab more attention than documentaries on AI that improve people’s lives.

**Jones: I would argue that people are drawn to good stories – narratives that contain an adversary and struggle, but in the end, have happy endings. And this is consistent with your comment on human nature and how history, despite its tendency for violence and destruction of humanity, somehow tends to correct itself.**

**Let’s take the example of a technology, which you are aware – GANs – General Adversarial Networks, which today has been used in applications for fake news and disinformation. In actuality, the purpose in the invention of GANs was far from what it is used for today.**

**Schmidhuber:** Yes, the name GANs was created in 2014 but we had the basic principle already in the early 1990s. More than 30 years ago, I called it *artificial curiosity*. It's a very simple way of injecting creativity into a little two network system. This creative AI is not just trying to slavishly imitate humans. Rather, it’s inventing its own goals. Let me explain:

You have two networks. One network is producing outputs that could be anything, any action. Then the second network is looking at these actions and it’s trying to predict the consequences of these actions. An action could move a robot, then something happens, and the other network is just trying to predict what will happen.

Now we can implement artificial curiosity by reducing the prediction error of the second network, which, at the same time, is the reward of the first network. The first network wants to maximize its reward and so it will invent actions that will lead to situations that will surprise the second network, which it has not yet learned to predict well.

In the case where the outputs are fake images, the first network will try to generate images that are good enough to fool the second network, which will attempt to predict the reaction of the environment: fake or real image, and it will try to become better at it. The first network will continue to also improve at generating images whose type the second network will not be able to predict. So, they fight each other. The 2nd network will continue to reduce its prediction error, while the 1st network will attempt to maximize it.

Through this zero-sum game the first network gets better and better at producing these convincing fake outputs which look almost realistic. So, once you have an interesting set of images by Vincent Van Gogh, you can generate new images that leverage his style, without the original artist having ever produced the artwork himself.

**Jones: I see how the Van Gogh example can be applied in an education setting and there are countless examples of artists mimicking styles from famous painters but image generation from this instance that can happen within seconds is quite another feat. And you know this is how GANs has been used. What’s more prevalent today is a socialized enablement of generating images or information to intentionally fool people. It also surfaces new harms that deal with the threat to intellectual property and copyright, where laws have yet to account for. And from your perspective this was not the intention when the model was conceived. What was your motivation in your early conception of what is now GANs?**

**Schmidhuber:** My old motivation for GANs was actually very important and it was not to create deepfakes or fake news but to enable AIs to be curious and invent their own goals, to make them explore their environment and make them creative.

Suppose you have a robot that executes one action, then something happens, then it executes another action, and so on, because it wants to achieve certain goals in the environment. For example, when the battery is low, this will trigger “pain” through hunger sensors, so it wants to go to the charging station, without running into obstacles, which will trigger other pain sensors. It will seek to minimize pain (encoded through numbers). Now the robot has a friend, the second network, which is a world model ––it’s a prediction machine that learns to predict the consequences of the robot’s actions.

Once the robot has a good model of the world, it can use it for planning. It can be used as a simulation of the real world. And then it can determine what is a good action sequence. If the robot imagines this sequence of actions, the model will predict a lot of pain, which it wants to avoid. If it plays this alternative action sequence in its mental model of the world, then it will predict a rewarding situation where it’s going to sit on the charging station and its battery is going to load again. So, it'll prefer to execute the latter action sequence.

In the beginning, however, the model of the world knows nothing, so how can we motivate the first network to generate experiments that lead to data that helps the world model learn something it didn’t already know? That’s what artificial curiosity is about. The dueling two network systems effectively explore uncharted environments by creating experiments so that over time the curious AI gets a better sense of how the environment works. This can be applied to all kinds of environments, and has medical applications.

**Jones: Let’s talk about the future. You have said, “*****Traditional humans won’t play a significant role in spreading intelligence across the universe.*****”**

**Schmidhuber:** Let’s first conceptually separate two types of AIs. The first type of AI are tools directed by humans. They are trained to do specific things like accurately detect diabetes or heart disease and prevent attacks before they happen. In these cases, the goal is coming from the human. More interesting AIs are setting their own goals. They are inventing their own experiments and learning from them. Their horizons expand and eventually they become more and more general problem solvers in the real world. They are not controlled by their parents, but much of what they learn is through self-invented experiments.

A robot, for example, is rotating a toy, and as it is doing this, the video coming in through the camera eyes, changes over time and it begins to learn how this video changes and learns how the 3D nature of the toy generates certain videos if you rotate it a certain way, and eventually, how gravity works, and how the physics of the world works. Like a little scientist!

And I have predicted for decades that future scaled-up versions of such AI scientists will want to further expand their horizons, and eventually go where most of the physical resources are, to build more and bigger AIs. And of course, almost all of these resources are far away from earth out there in space, which is hostile to humans but friendly to appropriately designed AI-controlled robots and self-replicating robot factories. So here we are not talking any longer about our tiny biosphere; no, we are talking about the much bigger rest of the universe.  Within a few tens of billions of years, curious self-improving [AIs will colonize the visible cosmos](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/falling-walls-the-past-present-and-future-of-artificial-intelligence/) in a way that’s infeasible for humans. Those who don’t won’t have an impact. Sounds like science fiction, but since the 1970s I have been unable to see a plausible alternative to this scenario, except for a global catastrophe such as an all-out nuclear war that stops this development before it takes off.

**Jones: How long have these AIs, which can set their own goals — how long have they existed? To what extent can they be independent of human interaction?**

**Schmidhuber:** Neural networks like that have existed for over 30 years. My first simple adversarial neural network system of this kind is the one from 1990 described above. You don’t need a teacher there; it's just a little agent running around in the world and trying to invent new experiments that surprise its own prediction machine.

Once it has figured out certain parts of the world, the agent will become bored and will move on to more exciting experiments. The simple 1990 systems I mentioned have certain limitations, but in the past three decades, we have also built more [sophisticated systems that are setting their own goals](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/artificial-curiosity-since-1990.html) and such systems I think will be essential for achieving true intelligence. If you are only imitating humans, you will never go beyond them. So, you really must give AIs the freedom to explore previously unexplored regions of the world in a way that no human is really predefining.

**Jones: Where is this being done today?**

**Schmidhuber:** Variants of neural network-based artificial curiosity are used today for agents that learn to play video games in a human-competitive way. We have also started to use them for automatic design of experiments in fields such as materials science. I bet many other fields will be affected by it: chemistry, biology, drug design, you name it. However, at least for now, these artificial scientists, as I like to call them, cannot yet compete with human scientists.

I don’t think it’s going to stay this way but, at the moment, it’s still the case.  Sure, AI has made a lot of progress. Since 1997, there have been superhuman chess players, and since 2011, through the DanNet of my team, there have been [superhuman visual pattern recognizers](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/DanNet-triggers-deep-CNN-revolution-2011.html). But there are other things where humans, at the moment at least, are much better, in particular, science itself.  In the lab we have many first examples of self-directed artificial scientists, but they are not yet convincing enough to appear on the radar screen of the public space, which is currently much more fascinated with simpler systems that just imitate humans and write texts based on previously seen human-written documents.

**Jones: You speak of these numerous instances dating back 30 years of these lab experiments where these self-driven agents are deciding and learning and moving on once they’ve learned. And I assume that that rate of learning becomes even faster over time. What kind of timeframe are we talking about when this eventually is taken outside of the lab and embedded into society?**

**Schmidhuber:** This could still take months or even years :-) Anyway, in the not-too-distant future, we will probably see artificial scientists who are good at devising experiments that allow them to discover new, previously unknown physical laws.

As always, we are going to profit from the old trend that has held at least since 1941: every decade compute is getting 100 times cheaper.

**Jones: How does this trend affect modern AI such as ChatGPT?**

**Schmidhuber:** Perhaps you know that all the recent famous AI applications such as ChatGPT and similar models are largely based on principles of artificial neural networks invented in the previous millennium. The main reason why they works so well now is the incredible acceleration of compute per dollar.

ChatGPT is driven by a neural network called “Transformer” described in 2017 by Google. I am happy about that because a quarter century earlier in 1991 I had a particular Transformer variant which is now called the “[Transformer with linearized self-attention](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI/status/1576966129993797632?cxt=HHwWgMDSkeKVweIrAAAA)”. Back then, not much could be done with it, because the compute cost was a million times higher than today. But today, one can train such models on half the internet and achieve much more interesting results.

**Jones: And for how long will this acceleration continue?**

**Schmidhuber:** There's no reason to believe that in the next 30 years, we won't have another factor of 1 million and that's going to be really significant. In the near future, for the first time we will have many not-so expensive devices that can compute as much as a human brain. The physical limits of computation, however, are much further out so even if the trend of a factor of 100 every decade continues, the physical limits (of 1051 elementary instructions per second and kilogram of matter) won’t be hit until, say, the mid-next century. Even in our current century, however, we’ll probably have many machines that compute more than all 10 billion human brains collectively and you can imagine, everything will change then!

**Jones: That is the big question. Is everything going to change? If so, what do you say to the next generation of leaders, currently coming out of college and university. So much of this change is already impacting how they study, how they will work, or how the future of work and livelihood is defined. What is their purpose and how do we change our systems so they will adapt to this new version of intelligence?**

**Schmidhuber:** For decades, people have asked me questions like that, because you know what I'm saying now, I have basically said since the 1970s, it’s just that today, people are paying more attention because, back then, they thought this was science fiction.

They didn't think that I would ever come close to achieving my crazy life goal of building a machine that learns to become smarter than myself such that I can retire. But now many have changed their minds and think it's conceivable. And now I have two daughters, 23 and 25. People ask me: what do I tell them? They know that Daddy always said, “*It seems likely that within your lifetimes, you will have new types of intelligence that are probably going to be superior in many ways, and probably all kinds of interesting ways.*” How should they prepare for that? And I kept telling them the obvious: **Learn how to learn new things**! It's not like in the previous millennium where within 20 years someone learned to be a useful member of society, and then took a job for 40 years and performed in this job until she received her pension. Now things are changing much faster and we must learn continuously just to keep up. I also told my girls that no matter how smart AIs are going to get, learn at least the basics of math and physics, because that’s the essence of our universe, and anybody who understands this will have an advantage, and learn all kinds of new things more easily. I also told them that social skills will remain important, because most future jobs for humans will continue to involve interactions with other humans, but I couldn’t teach them anything about that; they know much more about social skills than I do.

You touched on the big philosophical question about people’s purpose. Can this be answered without answering the even grander question: What’s the purpose of the entire universe?

We don’t know. But what’s happening right now might be connected to the unknown answer. Don’t think of humans as the crown of creation. Instead view human civilization as part of a much grander scheme, an important step (but not the last one) on the path of the universe from very simple initial conditions towards more and more unfathomable complexity. Now it seems ready to take its [next step, a step comparable to the invention of life itself over 3.5 billion years ago](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html#future).  Alas, don’t worry, in the end, all will be good!

**Jones: Let’s get back to this transformation happening right now with OpenAI. There are many questioning the efficacy and accuracy of ChatGPT, and are concerned its release has been premature. In light of the rampant adoption, educators have banned its use over concerns of plagiarism and how it stifles individual development. Should large language models like ChatGPT be used in school?**

**Schmidhuber:** When the calculator was first introduced, instructors forbade students from using it in school. Today, the consensus is that kids should learn the basic methods of arithmetic, but they should also learn to use the “artificial multipliers” aka calculators, even in exams, because laziness and efficiency is a hallmark of intelligence. Any intelligent being wants to minimize its efforts to achieve things.

And that's the reason why we have tools, and why our kids are learning to use these tools. The first stone tools were invented maybe 3.5 million years ago; tools just have become more sophisticated over time. In fact, humans have changed in response to the properties of their tools. Our anatomical evolution was shaped by tools such as spears and fire. So, it's going to continue this way. And there is no permanent way of preventing large language models from being used in school.

**Jones: And when our children, your children graduate, what does their future work look like?**

**Schmidhuber:** A single human trying to predict details of how 10 billion people and their machines will evolve in the future is like a single neuron in my brain trying to predict what the entire brain and its tens of billions of neurons will do next year. 40 years ago, before the WWW was created at CERN in Switzerland, who would have predicted all those young people making money as YouTube video bloggers?

Nevertheless, let’s make a few limited job-related observations. For a long time, people have thought that desktop jobs may require more intelligence than skills trade or handicraft professions. But now, it turns out that it's much easier to replace certain aspects of desktop jobs than replacing a carpenter, for example. Because everything that works well in AI is happening behind the screen currently, but not so much in the physical world.

There are now artificial systems that can read lots of documents and then make really nice summaries of these documents. That is a desktop job. Or you give them a description of an illustration that you want to have for your article and pretty good illustrations are being generated that may need some minimal fine-tuning. But you know, all these desktop jobs are much easier to facilitate than the real tough jobs in the physical world. And it's interesting that the things people thought required intelligence, like playing chess, or writing or summarizing documents, are much easier for machines than they thought. But for things like playing football or soccer, there is no physical robot that can remotely compete with the abilities of a little boy with these skills. So, AI in the physical world, interestingly, is much harder than AI behind the screen in virtual worlds. And it's really exciting, in my opinion, to see that jobs such as plumbers are much more challenging than playing chess or writing another tabloid story.

**Jones: The way data has been collected in these large language models does not guarantee personal information has not been excluded. Current consent laws already are outdated when it comes to these large language models (LLM). The concern, rightly so, is increasing surveillance and loss of privacy. What is your view on this?**

**Schmidhuber:** As I have indicated earlier: are surveillance and loss of privacy inevitable consequences of increasingly complex societies? Super-organisms such as cities and states and companies consist of numerous people, just like people consist of numerous cells. These cells enjoy little privacy. They are constantly monitored by specialized ""police cells"" and ""border guard cells"": Are you a cancer cell? Are you an external intruder, a pathogen? Individual cells sacrifice their freedom for the benefits of being part of a multicellular organism.

Similarly, for super-organisms such as nations. Over 5000 years ago, writing enabled recorded history and thus became its inaugural and most important invention. Its initial purpose, however, was to facilitate surveillance, to track citizens and their tax payments. The more complex a super-organism, the more comprehensive its collection of information about its constituents.

200 years ago, at least, the parish priest in each village knew everything about all the village people, even about those who did not confess, because they appeared in the confessions of others. Also, everyone soon knew about the stranger who had entered the village, because some occasionally peered out of the window, and what they saw got around. Such control mechanisms were temporarily lost through anonymization in rapidly growing cities but are now returning with the help of new surveillance devices such as smartphones as part of digital nervous systems that tell companies and governments a lot about billions of users. Cameras and drones etc. are becoming increasingly tinier and more ubiquitous. More effective recognition of faces and other detection technology are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and many will use it to identify others anywhere on earth; the big wide world will not offer any more privacy than the local village. Is this good or bad? Some nations may find it easier than others to justify more complex kinds of super-organisms at the expense of the privacy rights of their constituents.

**Jones: So, there is no way to stop or change this process of collection, or how it continuously informs decisions over time? How do you see governance and rules responding to this, especially amid** [**Italy’s ban on ChatGPT following**](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/italy-has-banned-chatgpt-heres-what-other-countries-are-doing.html) **suspected user data breach and the more recent news about the** [**Meta’s record $1.3billion fine**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-given-record-13-bln-fine-given-5-months-stop-eu-us-data-flows-2023-05-22/) **in the company’s handling of user information?**

**Schmidhuber:** Data collection has benefits and drawbacks, such as the loss of privacy. How to balance those? I have argued for addressing this through data ownership in data markets. If it is true that data is the new oil, then it should have a price, just like oil. At the moment, the major surveillance platforms such as Meta do not offer users any money for their data and the transitive loss of privacy. In the future, however, we will likely see attempts at creating efficient data markets to figure out the data's true financial value through the interplay between supply and demand.

Even some of the sensitive medical data should not be priced by governmental regulators but by patients (and healthy persons) who own it and who may sell or license parts thereof as micro-entrepreneurs in a healthcare data market.

Following a previous [interview](https://www.swissre.com/institute/conferences/The-intelligence-behind-artificial-intelligence.html), I gave for one of the largest re-insurance companies , let's look at the different participants in such a data market: patients, hospitals, data companies. (1) **Patients** with a rare form of cancer can offer more valuable data than patients with a very common form of cancer. (2) **Hospitals** and their machines are needed to extract the data, e.g., through magnet spin tomography, radiology, evaluations through human doctors, and so on. (3) **Companies** such as Siemens, Google or IBM would like to buy annotated data to make better artificial neural networks that learn to predict pathologies and diseases and the consequences of therapies. Now the market’s invisible hand will decide about the data’s price through the interplay between demand and supply. On the demand side, you will have several companies offering something for the data, maybe through an app on the smartphone (a bit like a stock market app). On the supply side, each patient in this market should be able to profit from high prices for rare valuable types of data. Likewise, competing data extractors such as hospitals will profit from gaining recognition and trust for extracting data well at a reasonable price. The market will make the whole system efficient through incentives for all who are doing a good job. Soon there will be a flourishing ecosystem of commercial data market advisors and what not, just like the ecosystem surrounding the traditional stock market. The value of the data won’t be determined by governments or ethics committees, but by those who own the data and decide by themselves which parts thereof they want to license to others under certain conditions.

At first glance, a market-based system seems to be detrimental to the interest of certain monopolistic companies, as they would have to pay for the data - some would prefer free data and keep their monopoly. However, since every healthy and sick person in the market would suddenly have an incentive to collect and share their data under self-chosen anonymity conditions, there will soon be many more useful data to evaluate all kinds of treatments. On average, people will live longer and healthier, and many companies and the entire healthcare system will benefit.

**Jones: Finally, what is your view on open source versus the private companies like Google and OpenAI? Is there a danger to supporting these private companies’ large language models versus trying to keep these models open source and transparent, very much like what LAION is doing?**

**Schmidhuber:** I signed this [open letter by LAION](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2023/04/19/amid-growing-call-to-pause-ai-research-laion-petitions-governments-to-keep-agi-research-open-active-and-responsible/?sh=6973c08b62e3) because I strongly favor the open-source movement. And I think it's also something that is going to challenge whatever big tech dominance there might be at the moment. Sure, the best models today are run by big companies with huge budgets for computers, but the exciting fact is that open-source models are not so far behind, some people say maybe six to eight months only. Of course, the private company models are all based on stuff that was created in academia, often in little labs without so much funding, which publish without patenting their results and open source their code and others take it and improved it.

Big tech has profited tremendously from academia; their main achievement being that they have scaled up everything greatly, sometimes even failing to credit the original inventors.

So, it's very interesting to see that as soon as some big company comes up with a new scaled-up model, lots of students out there are competing, or collaborating, with each other, trying to come up with equal or better performance on smaller networks and smaller machines. And since they are open sourcing, the next guy can have another great idea to improve it, so now there’s tremendous competition also for the big companies.

Because of that, and since AI is still getting exponentially cheaper all the time, I don't believe that big tech companies will dominate in the long run. They find it very hard to compete with the enormous open-source movement. As long as you can encourage the open-source community, I think you shouldn't worry too much. Now, of course, you might say if everything is open source, then the bad actors also will more easily have access to these AI tools. And there's truth to that. But as always since the invention of controlled fire, it was good that knowledge about how technology works quickly became public such that everybody could use it. And then, against any bad actor, there's almost immediately a counter actor trying to nullify his efforts. You see, I still believe in our old motto ""AI∀"" or ""AI For All.""

**Jones: Thank you, Juergen for sharing your perspective on this amazing time in history. It’s clear that with new technology, the enormous potential can be matched by disparate and troubling risks which we’ve yet to solve, and even those we have yet to identify. If we are to dispel the fear of a sentient system for which we have no control, humans, alone need to take steps for more responsible development and collaboration to ensure AI technology is used to ultimately benefit society. Humanity will be judged by what we do next.**"

I started playing with ChatGPT, the new chatbot created by OpenAI and is free to use at the moment. 

I asked it to describe a scene between Batman and Joker on a subway platform and the result is mind blowing! I let you have a read of the story yourself:

Generated by ChatGPT:

The scene is set in a dimly lit subway station, with the Joker standing on the platform, gazing up at Batman who is perched on a nearby overhead beam. The Joker is dressed in his signature purple suit and green hair, a wicked grin plastered across his face.

In his hand, he holds a deck of playing cards, flipping them expertly through his fingers. The sound of the cards shuffling echoes through the empty station.

Batman, dressed in his dark suit and cape, stares down at the Joker with a steely gaze. His muscles are tense, ready for any sudden movements from the villain.

The Joker cackles, his laughter bouncing off the walls of the station. ""Hello, Batsy! Long time no see. How's the crime-fighting business these days?""

Batman remains silent, watching the Joker carefully.

The Joker's grin widens. ""Come on, Bats. Don't be so serious all the time. Let's have some fun."" He tosses a card at Batman, who easily catches it.

""I'm not here to play games, Joker,"" Batman says in a grave tone.

The Joker's laughter turns into a maniacal cackle. ""But that's the whole point, Batsy! Life is a game. And I'm the master of it.""

He pulls out a bomb from his pocket and holds it up, the timer ticking down. ""Let's see how well you can play, shall we?""

Batman leaps down from the beam, landing gracefully on the platform. He advances towards the Joker, who backs away, still holding the bomb.

The tension in the air is palpable as the two foes face off, each ready to outsmart the other. The sound of the bomb's timer counts down, adding to the tension of the scene.

The Joker's grin never fades, even as Batman inches closer. ""It's always a pleasure to play with you, Batsy. But I think it's time for me to make my exit.""

With a flourish, the Joker disappears in a cloud of smoke, leaving Batman standing alone on the platform. The bomb detonates, causing a small explosion and sending debris flying.

But Batman remains unharmed, ready to continue the never-ending battle against the Joker and all the evil that plagues the city.

End of the story.

1. Firstly, I noticed my iPhone heats up and does things like reducing screen brightness -- which is what I normally see it do when im doing something computationally intensive for an iPhone, like using photo or video editing apps.
2. I also noticed that if I start a conversation on the iPhone app and then resume it on the browser, I get a message saying ""The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model."" I get this message regardless of if I use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, but NOT if I use GPT-4 with plugins or web-browsing.

This, along with the fact that OpenAI took 8 months to release what one might have considered to be relatively simple web-app -- and that they've only released it so far on iOS, which has a pretty uniform and consistent environment when it comes to machine learning hardware (the Apple Neural Engine) -- makes me thing that they are experimenting with GPT models that are conducing at least SOME of their machine learning inference ON the device, rather than through the cloud.

It wouldn't be shocking if they were -- ever since Meta's LLaMA models were released into the wild, we've seen absolutely mind-blowing advances in terms of people creating more efficient and effective models with smaller parameter sizes. We've also seen LLMs to start working on less and less powerful devices, such as consumer-grade computers / smartphones / etc.

This, plus the rumors that OpenAI might be releasing their own open-source model to the public in the near future makes me think that the ChatGPT app might in fact be a first step toward GPT systems running at least PARTIALLY on devices locally.

Here is part of the derivation where they ... somehow... insert the KLD. It's not clear to me at all how this jump was made. Yes, I have looked at the definition of KLD, yes, I have googled around but everyone seems to just take this on faith. ChatGPT says ""theres a hidden expectation that's not shown"".

Does anyone know?

**Update:** Thanks everyone for the comments, my conclusion here is that DDPM paper has an error in it, namely, the above image. 

The error is because they show the outer expectation not being used up, where indeed it IS being used up. 

I found a correct write-up of the derivation here in Calvin's paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11970.pdf). And here is the image:

The above is correct, while the DDPM paper is wrong.

It warns of the potential for GPT-4 to produce malicious code and highly tailored propaganda and the risk that biased training data could result in baked-in stereotypes or unfair race and gender preferences in hiring. 

The complaint also mentions significant privacy failures with OpenAI's product interface, such as a recent bug that exposed OpenAI ChatGPT histories and possibly payment details of ChatGPT plus subscribers.

**Live demo:** [**https://www.glaciermd.com/search**](https://www.glaciermd.com/search?utm_campaign=reddit_post_1)

**Background**

I've been working for a while on building a better version of WebMD, and I recently started playing around with LLMs, trying to figure out if there was anything useful there.

The problem with the current batch of ""predict-next-token"" LLMs is that they hallucinate—you can ask ChatGPT to answer medical questions, but it'll either

1. Refuse to answer (not great)
2. Give a completely false answer (really super bad)

So I spent some time trying to coax these LLMs to give answers based on a very specific set of inputs (peer-reviewed medical research) to see if I could get more accurate answers. And I did!

The best part is you can actually trace the final answer back to the original sources, which will hopefully instill some confidence in the result.

Here's how it works:

1. User types in a question
2. Pull top \~800 studies from Semantic Scholar and Pubmed
3. Re-rank using `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`
4. Ask `text-davinci-003` to answer the question based on the top 10 studies (if possible)
5. Summarize those answers using `text-davinci-003`

Would love to hear what people think (and if there's a better/cheaper way to do it!).

At what point did FAANGs boldly state: preferred (required) to have publications at top-tier venues (ICLR, ICML, CVPR, NIPS, etc) in their job postings?

I use the word 'creep' in the same context 'power creep' is used in battle animes where the scale of power slowly gets to such an irrationally large scale that anything in the past looks extremely weak.

Back in late 2016 I landed my first ML role at a defense firm (lol) but to be fair had just watched a couple ML courses on YouTube, took maybe 2 ML grad courses, and had an incomplete working knowledge of CNNs. Never used Tensorflow, had some experience with Theano not sure if it's exists anymore. 

I'm certain that skill set would be insufficient in the 2023 ML industry. But it begs the question is this skill creep making the job market impenetrable for folks who were already working post 2012-2014. 

Neural architectures are becoming increasingly complex. You want to develop a multi-modal architecture for an embodied agent? Well you better know a good mix of DL involving RL+CV+NLP. Improving latency on edge devices - how well do you know your ONNX/TensorRT/CUDA kernels, your classes likely didn't even teach you those. Masters is the new bachelors degree, and that's just to give you a fighting chance. 

Yeah not sure if it was after the release of AlexNet in 2012, Tensorflow in 2015, Attention /Transformers in 2017 or now ChatGPT - but the skill creep is definitely creating an increasingly fast and growing technical rigor in the field. Close your eyes for 2 years and your models feel prehistoric and your CUDA, Pytorch, Nvidia Driver, NumPy  versions need a fat upgrade.

**AI Startup Hugging Face Is Raising Fresh VC Funds At $4 Billion Valuation**

Hugging Face is raising a new funding round that is expected to value the high-flying AI startup at $4 billion, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter tell Forbes.

The Series D funding round is expected to raise at least $200 million, two sources said, with Ashton Kutcher’s venture capital firm, Sound Ventures, currently leading an investor scrum. But cofounder and CEO Clément Delangue is shopping around as the company has received multiple offers this week, four sources added.

Delangue was expected to pick a preferred offer as soon as Friday, according to another source, who noted that the situation was still fluid, meaning no agreement has been reached, and the numbers involved could change. Several other sources, who asked to remain anonymous as they weren’t authorized to talk about the deal, said that Hugging Face could seek to raise more, as much as $300 million, while existing investors could still attempt to take the round in a last-minute bid. GV, the venture firm backed by Alphabet, and DFJ were said to be looking at the round, one source added.

Hugging Face didn’t respond to requests for comment. GV declined to comment. Coatue, DFJ, Kutcher, and Lux also didn’t respond.

The anticipated funding is the latest exclamation point in a cash frenzy for promising AI companies, particularly those providing large-language models, or LLMs, that power them. Just over a year ago, Hugging Face raised $100 million in a Series C round led by Lux Capital; Coatue and Sequoia were new investors in that round, joining A.Capital Ventures and Addition. The company had attained a $2 billion valuation in that round despite taking in less than $10 million in revenue in 2021. Its revenue run rate has spiked this year and now sits at around $30 million to $50 million, three sources said — with one noting that it had more that tripled compared to the start of the year.

Named after the emoji of a smiling face with jazz hands, Brooklyn-based Hugging Face has grown quickly by offering what Delangue has described as a “GitHub for machine learning.” It is a central company in a growing movement of AI models that are open sourced, meaning that anyone can access and modify them for free. Hugging Face makes money by charging for security and corporate tools on top of a hub of hundreds of thousands of models trained by its community of developers, including the popular Stable Diffusion model that forms the basis for another controversial AI unicorn, Stability AI. (On Thursday, a Stability AI cofounder sued CEO Emad Mostaque, alleging he was tricked into selling his stake for next to nothing.) Per a Forbes profile in 2022, Bloomberg, Pfizer and Roche were early Hugging Face customers.

Earlier this year, Delangue warned that model providers reliant on paying huge sums to Big Tech’s cloud providers would function as “cloud money laundering.” But training and maintaining models — and building enterprise-grade businesses around them — remains costly. In June, Inflection AI raised $1.3 billion, in part to manage its Microsoft compute and Nvidia hardware costs; the same month, foundation model rival Cohere raised $270 million. Anthropic, maker of the recently-released ChatGPT rival Claude 2, raised $450 million in May. OpenAI closed its own $300 million share sale in April, then raised $175 million for a fund to back other startups a month later, per a filing. Adept became a unicorn after announcing a $350 million fundraise in March. Stability AI, meanwhile, met with a number of venture firms in the spring seeking its own new up-round, industry sources said.

At a $4 billion valuation, Hugging Face would vault to one of the category’s highest-valued companies, matching Inflection AI and just behind Anthropic, reported to have reached closer to $5 billion. OpenAI remains the giant in the fast-growing category, Google, Meta and infrastructure companies like Databricks excluded; while its ownership and valuation structure is complex, the company’s previous financings implied a price tag in the $27 billion to $29 billion range.

Speaking for another Forbes story on the breakout moment for generative AI tools, Delangue predicted, “I think there’s potential for multiple $100 billion companies.”"

Abstract:

>Solving complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities is a key step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). While there are abundant AI models available for different domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional ability in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks and language could be a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, a system that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., HuggingFace) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in HuggingFace, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in HuggingFace, HuggingGPT is able to cover numerous sophisticated AI tasks in different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which **paves a new way towards AGI.**

Since, I've been working in a semi-related area (computer assisted humanities) as a data engineer/software developer/ML engineer (it's a small team so many hats). Not much in terms of latest news, so I tried recently to get up to speed with the recent developments.

But there are so many ! Everywhere. Even just in NLP, not considering all the other fields such as reinforcement learning, computer vision, all the fundamentals of ML etc. It is damn near impossible to gather an in-depth understanding of a model as they are so complex, and numerous. All of them are built on top of other ones, so you also need to read up on those to understand anything. I follow some people on LinkedIn who just give new names every week or so. Going to look for papers in top conferences is also daunting as there is no guarantee that a paper with an award will translate to an actual system, while companies churn out new architectures without the research paper/methodology being made public. It's overwhelming. 

So I guess my question is two fold : how does one get up to speed after a year of not being too much in the field ? And how does one keep up after that ?"

But with the release of ChatGPT, particularly its API, everything changed. It performed better than our model, quite obvious with the amount of data is was trained on, and is cheap with moderate rate limits.

Seeing its performance, higher management got way too excited and have now put all their faith in ChatGPT API. They are even willing to ignore privacy, high response time, unpredictability, etc. concerns.

They have asked us to discard and dump most of our previous ML models, stop experimenting any new models and for most of our cases use the ChatGPT API.

Not only my team, but the higher management is planning to replace all ML models in our entire software by ChatGPT, effectively rendering all ML based teams useless.

Motivated by this, I built a proof-of-concept web browser embedded with a co-pilot that can ""view"" the browser and interact with it. Currently, the demo is basic, utilizing web-scraping to morph ChatGPT Plus into an unofficial GPT-4V API at the backend. It lacks some actions and an adblock, resulting in the agent potentially being overloaded by the extensive popups and visual disruption common on most websites.

Despite the limited tests conducted so far, the agent has shown the capability to post on Reddit, search for products, and initiate the checkout process. Interestingly, it even detected auto-labeler glitches when trying to play a game and attempted to revert the action. (The sam auto-labeler from the SoM demo would be sufficient to allow this agent to interact with game UI)

I'm a firm believer that scaled-up versions of such agents could significantly improve productivity and accessibility across an array of computer applications.

I'm eager to hear your thoughts, particularly on the trending shift towards general AI agents and assistants, examples being Windows Copilot, Adept ACT-1, AutoGPT, [UI-Act](https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1765v6i/d_p_uibased_ai_agents_uiact/), among others.

Language models (LMs) furnished with abilities, such as function-calling, follow a growing trend. These primarily rely on text-based state representations and APIs for execution. In scenarios where these are impractical, UI-based agents may offer a more universal alternative. Given that the agent's interplay with the computer is the same as that of humans, it's easier to train using expert demonstrations without requiring substantial technical expertise.

Looking forward to hearing your views!

Throughout history, humans have dreamed of robots that could assist them with their daily lives and work. With the emergence of home assistants and OpenAI's Copilot, requests such as 'Please lower the temperature of the air conditioning' or even 'Please help me build an online store' have become possible.The emergence of GPT-4 has further demonstrated the potential of multimodal large models in visual understanding. In the open-source small model space, LLAVA and minigpt-4 have performed well in image recognition and chat, and can even suggest recipes for food images. However, these models still face significant challenges in practical implementation: they lack accurate localization capabilities and cannot provide specific locations of objects in images, nor can they understand complex human instructions to detect specific objects, making it difficult for them to perform specific tasks as requested by humans. In practical scenarios, if people could simply take a photo and ask an intelligent assistant for the correct answer to a complex problem, such a 'take a photo and ask' feature would be incredibly cool.  
To implement the ""**take a photo and ask**"" feature, robots need to have several capabilities:

1. Language understanding: the ability to listen and understand human intentions.
2. Visual understanding: the ability to understand the objects in the image.
3. Common sense reasoning: the ability to convert complex human intentions into precise and locatable targets.
4. Object localization: the ability to locate and detect corresponding objects in the image.

Currently, only a few large models (such as Google's PaLM-E) possess all four of these capabilities. However, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have proposed an open-source model called DetGPT (DetectionGPT), which only needs to fine-tune three million parameters to easily acquire complex reasoning and local object localization capabilities that can be generalized to most scenarios. This means that the model can easily recognize the objects that humans are interested in through self-knowledge reasoning and understand abstract human instructions. They have already developed a ""take a photo and ask"" demo using the model, which can be experienced online: [https://detgpt.github.io/](https://detgpt.github.io/)DetGPT allows users to operate everything with natural language without the need for complex commands or interfaces. In addition, DetGPT has intelligent reasoning and object detection capabilities, which can accurately understand user needs and intentions. For example, if a human gives a language instruction, ""I want to have a cold beverage,"" the robot first searches for a cold drink in the scene but does not find any. It then begins to think, ""There is no visible beverage. Where can I find it?"" Through its powerful common sense reasoning ability, the model realizes that the fridge is a possible location and scans the scene to successfully locate the drink!

## Features of DetGPT

DetGPT has several unique features:

1. It has a significantly improved understanding of specific objects in images. Compared to previous models that use multimodal dialogues, DetGPT can retrieve and locate target objects from images based on the user's instructions, rather than simply describing the entire image.
2. It can understand complex human instructions, which lowers the barrier for users to ask questions. For example, the model can understand the question ""find fruits that can relieve hypertension?"" Traditional object detection requires humans to know the answer and pre-set the detection category, such as ""banana.""
3. DetGPT can use existing LLM knowledge to reason and accurately locate the corresponding object in the image that can solve more complex tasks. For complex tasks, such as ""fruits that can relieve hypertension,"" DetGPT can reason step by step: relieving hypertension -> potassium can relieve hypertension -> bananas are rich in potassium -> bananas can relieve hypertension -> need to identify the object banana.
4. It provides answers beyond human common sense. For some uncommon questions, such as which fruits are rich in potassium, the model can provide answers based on existing knowledge.

## A new direction: reasoning-based object detection

Traditional object detection tasks require pre-defined categories of possible objects for detection. However, providing accurate and comprehensive descriptions of the objects to be detected can be difficult and unrealistic for humans. This is due to the limitations of human memory and knowledge. For instance, a doctor may recommend that people with hypertension eat fruits rich in potassium, but may not know which specific fruits are rich in potassium, making it impossible to provide specific fruit names for the model to detect. If the question ""Identify fruits that can help alleviate hypertension"" could be directly posed to the detection model, humans would only need to take a photo, and the model could think, reason, and detect fruits rich in potassium, making the problem much simpler.Moreover, the examples of object categories provided by humans are not always comprehensive. For instance, if monitoring is required to detect behaviors that violate public order relative to public places, humans may only be able to provide a few simple scenarios, such as holding a knife or smoking. However, if the question ""detect behaviors that violate public order"" is directly posed to the detection model, the model can think and reason based on its own knowledge, thus capturing more unacceptable behaviors and generalizing to more relevant categories that need to be detected. After all, the knowledge that ordinary humans have access to is limited, and the object categories that they can provide examples of are also limited. However, if there is a big brain-like ChatGPT-like model to assist and reason, the instructions that humans need to provide will be much simpler, and the obtained answers will be much more accurate and comprehensive.To address the limitations of human instructions and their abstract nature, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have proposed a new direction called ""reasoning-based object detection."" In simple terms, humans give complex tasks, and the model can understand and reason about which objects in the image might be able to complete the task, and then detect them. For example, if a person describes ""I want to drink a cold drink, where can I find it,"" and the model sees a picture of a kitchen, it can detect the ""refrigerator."" This topic requires the perfect combination of multimodal models' image understanding ability and the rich knowledge stored in language models. It is used in fine-grained detection scenarios to accurately locate objects of interest to humans in images without pre-defined object categories.  


# The Approach

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ho9ux1pcahza1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf42e1baffa2925e8b946b191766ca116aec2fe1

The ""reasoning-based object detection"" is a challenging problem because the detector needs to understand and reason about the user's coarse-grained/abstract instructions and analyze the current visual information to locate the target object accurately. In this direction, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have conducted some preliminary explorations. Specifically, they use a pre-trained visual encoder (BLIP-2) to extract visual features from images and align the visual features to the text space using an alignment function. They use a large-scale language model (Robin/Vicuna) to understand the user's question, combined with the visual information they see, to reason about the objects that users are truly interested in. Then, they provide the object names to the pre-trained detector (Grounding-DINO) for specific location prediction. In this way, the model can analyze the image based on any user instructions and accurately predict the location of the object of interest to the user.  
It is worth noting that the difficulty here mainly lies in the fact that the model needs to achieve task-specific output formats for different specific tasks as much as possible without damaging the model's original abilities. To guide the language model to follow specific patterns and generate outputs that conform to the object detection format, the research team used ChatGPT to generate cross-modal instruction data to fine-tune the model. Specifically, based on 5000 coco images, they used ChatGPT to create a 30,000 cross-modal image-text fine-tuning dataset. To improve the efficiency of training, they fixed other model parameters and only learned cross-modal linear mapping. Experimental results show that even if only the linear layer is fine-tuned, the language model can understand fine-grained image features and follow specific patterns to perform inference-based image detection tasks, showing excellent performance.  
This research topic has great potential. Based on this technology, the field of home robots will further shine: people in homes can use abstract or coarse-grained voice instructions to make robots understand, recognize, and locate the objects they need, and provide relevant services. In the field of industrial robots, this technology will bring endless vitality: industrial robots can cooperate more naturally with human workers, accurately understand their instructions and needs, and achieve intelligent decision-making and operations. On the production line, human workers can use coarse-grained voice instructions or text input to allow robots to automatically understand, recognize, and locate the items that need to be processed, thereby improving production efficiency and quality.  
With object detection models that come with reasoning capabilities, we can develop more intelligent, natural, and efficient robots to provide more convenient, efficient, and humane services to humans. This is a field with broad prospects and deserves more attention and further exploration by more researchers.  
DetGPT supports multiple language models and has been validated based on two language models, Robin-13B and Vicuna-13B. The Robin series language model is a dialogue model trained by the LMFlow team ( https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, achieving results competitive to Vicuna on multiple language ability evaluation benchmarks (model download: [https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow#model-zoo](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow#model-zoo)). Previously, the LMFlow team trained a vertical GPT model using a consumer-grade 3090 graphics card in just 5 hours. Today, this team, in collaboration with the NLP Group at the University of Hong Kong, has brought us a multimodal surprise.

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1703961405999759638) shows the style of prompts that are being used to get these results with the new language model.

I used website parrotchess\[dot\]com (discovered [here](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1704179448013070560)) to play multiple games of chess purportedly pitting this new language model vs. various levels at website Lichess, which supposedly uses Fairy-Stockfish 14 according to the Lichess user interface.

Not included in the tally are games that I had to abort because the parrotchess user interface stalled (5 instances), because I accidentally copied a move incorrectly in the parrotchess user interface (numerous instances), or because the parrotchess user interface doesn't allow the promotion of a pawn to anything other than queen (1 instance). **Update: There could have been up to 5 additional losses - the number of times the parrotchess user interface stalled - that would have been recorded in this tally if** [this language model resignation bug](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1705894692603269503) **hadn't been present. Also, the quality of play of some online chess bots can perhaps vary depending on the speed of the user's hardware.**

The following is a screenshot from parrotchess showing the end state of the first game vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5:

The game results in this paragraph are from using parrotchess after the forementioned resignation bug was fixed. The language model is 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish level 7 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/Se3t7syX)), and 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 8 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/j3W2OwrP)).

There are several other ways to play chess against the new language model if you have access to the OpenAI API. The first way is to use the OpenAI Playground as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CReHXhmMprg).

From blog post [Playing chess with large language models](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2023/chess-llm.html):

>Computers have been better than humans at chess for at least the last 25 years. And for the past five years, deep learning models have been better than the best humans. But until this week, in order to be good at chess, a machine learning model had to be explicitly designed to play games: it had to be told explicitly that there was an 8x8 board, that there were different pieces, how each of them moved, and what the goal of the game was. Then it had to be trained with reinforcement learning agaist itself. And then it would win.  
>  
>This all changed on Monday, when OpenAI released GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct, an instruction-tuned language model that was designed to just write English text, but that people on the internet quickly discovered can play chess at, roughly, the level of skilled human players.

Post [Chess as a case study in hidden capabilities in ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6vH6fr8ngo7csDdf/chess-as-a-case-study-in-hidden-capabilities-in-chatgpt) from last month covers a different prompting style used for the older chat-based GPT 3.5 Turbo language model. If I recall correctly from my tests with ChatGPT-3.5, using that prompt style with the older language model can defeat Stockfish level 2 at Lichess, but I haven't been successful in using it to beat Stockfish level 3. In my tests, both the quality of play and frequency of illegal attempted moves seems to be better with the new prompt style with the new language model compared to the older prompt style with the older language model.

P.S. Since some people claim that language model gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is always playing moves memorized from the training dataset, I searched for data on the uniqueness of chess positions. From [this video](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2225), we see that for a certain game dataset there were 763,331,945 chess positions encountered in an unknown number of games without removing duplicate chess positions, 597,725,848 different chess positions reached, and 582,337,984 different chess positions that were reached only once. Therefore, for that game dataset the probability that a chess position in a game was reached only once is 582337984 / 763331945 = 76.3%. For the larger dataset [cited](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2187) in that video, there are approximately (506,000,000 - 200,000) games in the dataset (per [this paper](http://tom7.org/chess/survival.pdf)), and 21,553,382,902 different game positions encountered. Each game in the larger dataset added a mean of approximately 21,553,382,902 / (506,000,000 - 200,000) = 42.6 different chess positions to the dataset. For [this different dataset](https://lichess.org/blog/Vs0xMTAAAD4We4Ey/opening-explorer) of \~12 million games, \~390 million different chess positions were encountered. Each game in this different dataset added a mean of approximately (390 million / 12 million) = 32.5 different chess positions to the dataset. From the aforementioned numbers, we can conclude that a strategy of playing only moves memorized from a game dataset would fare poorly because there are not rarely new chess games that have chess positions that are not present in the game dataset."

I'm trying to understand what available LLMs one can ""relatively easily"" play with. My goal is to understand the landscape since I haven't worked in this field before.

Here are some examples I have found so far:

1. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (obviously) - 175B params
2. [OpenAI api](https://platform.openai.com/) to access GPT-3s (from ada (0.5B) to davinci (175B)). Also [CodeX](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/codex)
3. [Bloom](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) (176B) - text window on that page seems to work reliably, you just need to keep pressing ""generate""
4. [OPT-175B](https://opt.alpa.ai/) (Facebook LLM), the hosting works surprisingly fast, but slower than ChatGPT
5. Several models on HuggingFace that I made to run with Colab Pro subscription: [GPT-NeoX](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt_neox) 20B, [Flan-t5-xxl](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl) 11B, [Xlm-roberta-xxl](https://huggingface.co/facebook/xlm-roberta-xxl) 10.7B, [GPT-j](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gptj) 6B. I spent about $20 total on running the models below. None of the Hugging face API interfaces/spaces didn't work for me :(. Here is an [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Cngzh5VFrpDqtHcaCYFpW10twsuwGvGy?usp=sharing) I made for NeoX.

Does anyone know more models that are easily accessible?

From my personal experience, the quality of the model depends a lot on the fine-tuning data as opposed to just the sheer size. If you choose your retraining data correctly, you can fine-tune your smaller model to perform better than the state-of-the-art GPT-X. The future of LLMs might look more open-source than imagined 3 months back?

Would love to hear everyone's opinions on how they see the future of LLMs evolving? Will it be few players (OpenAI) cracking the AGI and conquering the whole world or a lot of smaller open-source models which ML engineers fine-tune for their use-cases?

P.S. I am kinda betting on the latter and building [UpTrain](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain), an open-source project which helps you collect that high quality fine-tuning dataset"
62,machinelearning,chatgpt,top,2023-04-28 16:10:02,[P] We built an app that allows you to easily talk to your LLMs (or anything else),sergeybok,False,0.83,101,131z2k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/131z2k9/p_we_built_an_app_that_allows_you_to_easily_talk/,17,1682698202.0,"Hi all. So this all started with me wanting to talk to my local Alpaca bot from the bar to show my friend something. He’s a mobile developer and also recently unemployed like me, so the stars aligned and we built this thing over the last few weeks. 

Friendly AI is an app that is compatible with the [BaseBot](https://github.com/sergeybok/BaseBot) python library that we built. We are basically open sourcing the message protocol that it uses so that you can build your own “backend” for it that does whatever you want! I recently built myself a bot that allows me to write and run commands, shell scripts, and even python from my phone. Very handy when you went to the bar and forgot to commit and push your code. 

[Apple app is available](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-ai/id6447589849). The android app is currently in review so hopefully comes out later today.

If you are using Mac/Ubuntu the Quickstart command from the GitHub Readme should set you up with a starter project. If you either already have openai key on your system, or you create one and provide it on install, it will start you off with a simple ChatGPT wrapper (like the one that comes with the app if you Sign Up). 

If you are on windows I’m sorry neither of us has one so we couldn’t create an install script. However if you pip install the library and read the Readme you should be fine. 

Furthermore because it’s self-hosted, you can be sure that your data stays private. It’s stored on your own machine (in mongodb if you have it setup, in json files if you don’t). When you message your bots from the app the message data is sent directly to your bot and nowhere else. 

I think here of all places people will make good use of this tech. Because personally since I don’t have millions of dollars and can’t be actually working on proper LLM research by myself (which is what I’d rather be doing tbh), at least I can build cool stuff that uses the already existing models. 

The signup stuff isn’t necessary, the only reason why we built it is just to be able to limit people’s use of our bots, while also providing some access to them since without any bots you can’t try out the app. But we want people to build their own bots, and not simply use ours!

My hope was that it would remove a lot of the annoying parts of building bots and let people (including myself) concentrate on the actual interesting / ML /etc. parts of the problem — namely what the bot actually does in response to user prompts! And of course, the response doesn't actually have to use any LLMs (e.g. you can hook up your local stable diffusion model), or ML in general (as I said earlier I made a bot that simply executes the shell commands i give it). 

PS. Our servers are basically free-tier so in the off-chance that there’s a lot of downloads they might not hold up. But even if our servers are completely down that affects only our bots, you can still talk with your own bots!"

Abstract:

>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made incredible progress recently. On the one hand, advanced foundation models like ChatGPT can offer powerful conversation, in-context learning and code generation abilities on a broad range of open-domain tasks. They can also generate high-level solution outlines for domain-specific tasks based on the common sense knowledge they have acquired. However, they still face difficulties with some specialized tasks because they lack enough domain specific data during pre-training or they often have errors in their neural network computations on those tasks that need accurate executions. On the other hand, there are also many existing models and systems (symbolic-based or neural-based) that can do some domain specific tasks very well. However, due to the different implementation or working mechanisms, they are not easily accessible or compatible with foundation models. Therefore, there is a clear and pressing need for a mechanism that can leverage foundation models to propose task solution outlines and then automatically match some of the sub tasks in the outlines to the off-the-shelf models and systems with special functionalities to complete them. Inspired by this, we introduce TaskMatrix.AI as a new AI ecosystem that connects foundation models with millions of APIs for task completion. Unlike most previous work that aimed to improve a single AI model, TaskMatrix.AI focuses more on using existing foundation models (as a brain-like central system) and APIs of other AI models and systems (as sub-task solvers) to achieve diversified tasks in both digital and physical domains. As a position paper, we will present our vision of how to build such an ecosystem, explain each key component, and use study cases to illustrate both the feasibility of this vision and the main challenges we need to address next.

65,machinelearning,chatgpt,top,2023-07-17 16:12:12,[P] Chapyter: ChatGPT Code Interpreter in Jupyter Notebooks,Shannon-Shen,False,0.93,94,15269v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15269v8/p_chapyter_chatgpt_code_interpreter_in_jupyter/,17,1689610332.0,"I recently made a new JupyterLab extension called [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) (𝐂𝐡𝐚ts in Ju𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐞𝐫) that aims at solving many pain points when using other AI coding assistants. I want to share with y'all the tools as well as my thinkings while building this.

**What is Chapyter**

Chapyter is a JupyterLab extension that seamlessly connects GPT-4 to your coding environment. Here are the key features: 

* **Code generation from natural language and automatic execution**   
Simply adding the magic command `%%chat` at the beginning of the cell of a natural language description of the task, the code is generated and the results are shown in a few seconds.

https://i.redd.it/y7l0s9pf5hcb1.gif

* **Using coding history and execution output for code generation**  
By adding the `--history` or `-h` flag in generation, chapyter can use the previous execution history and outputs to generate the appropriate visualization for the loaded IRIS dataset.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7pu6cbug5hcb1.gif

* **In-situ debugging and code editing**  
The generated code might not be perfect and could contain bugs or errors. Since Chapyter is fully integrated into Jupyter Notebook, you can easily inspect the code and fix any errors or bugs (e.g., installing missing dependencies in this case) without leaving the IDE.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mz4n4qsh5hcb1.gif

* **Transparency on the prompts and AI configuration and allows for customization**  
We release all the prompts used in our library and we are working on easy customization of the used prompts and settings.
* **Privacy-first when using latest powerful AI**  
Since we are using OpenAI API, all the data sent to OpenAI will not be saved for training (see [OpenAI API Data Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). As a comparison, whenever you are using Copilot or ChatGPT, your data will be somewhat cached and can be used for their training and analysis.

**Why did I build Chapyter?** 

* Sometimes, I want to have an AI agent to *take over* some coding tasks, i.e., generating and executing the code and showing me the results based on some natural language instruction.
* I want the AI agent to be fully integrated in my IDE such that it can provide context-aware support and I can easily inspect and edit the generated code. 
* I want transparency on how the code is generated (knowing the prompts) and want to customize the code generation sometimes
* I want to keep my code and data private as much and I am hesitant to upload any WIP progress code/data elsewhere.

Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, NONE of any existing AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT Code Interpreter can satisfy all of the above requirements. We include more details here in our [blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter). 

Please check our Github Repo [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) and our [latest blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter) for more details. Feel free to try it out and looking forward to your thoughts :)"

PyReason is a Python package for logical inference and designed for use with machine learning ([https://github.com/lab-v2/pyreason](https://github.com/lab-v2/pyreason)).

You may think that’s all fine and good, but are wondering why would we need a logic for machine learning? In this post, I’ll discuss why we did it.

First, a lot of the criticism of machine learning, especially deep learning is that while it obtains excellent result son may tasks, it is merely mimicking historical data and not learning actual relationships. This has resulted in a lot of the major shortcomings in ML such as the [hallucinations](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/podcasts/hard-fork-bing-ai-elon.html?action=click&module=audio-series-bar&region=header&pgtype=Article) of large language models, the requirements of vast amounts of training data to learn games, and brittleness in certain applications (e.g., the recent defeat of AlphaGo, difficulty in [solving math problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11f29f9/r_chatgpt_failure_increase_linearly_with_addition/)). In a video lecture, we review some of these shortcomings, much of which constitutes active areas of research ([part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cooDzgd8NA), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2xfgwovwso)).

Then enter “[neuro symbolic](https://neurosymoblic.asu.edu/)” artificial intelligence. Actually an old idea where neural architectures can work hand-in-hand with logic, often even having an equivalence between the two. The idea is symbolic AI has many shortcomings (brittleness to noise, difficulty in learning) that can be address with deep learning while its strengths (modularity, ability to add constraints, symbolic manipulation) can address some of deep learning’s limitations.

Neuro symbolic AI is a highly active area of research, and much of the advancements have identified special logical languages to use in their approach. Our goal with PyReason was to unify many of these logics and provide logic capabilities in a robust and modern Python implementation. We are working on a few joint projects with industry partners applying this to various use-cases, and now we have made the code base and library available as an open source package. In a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PSl3KQCmo&t=8s), we outline six major capabilities that we felt were important:

1. Open world reasoning – ability to reason in uncertain situations (important for interfacing with ML models)
2. Multi-step inference
3. Explainability
4. Temporal reasoning
5. Graph-based reasoning
6. Designed to support neuro symbolic frameworks

The release of PyReason will kick off not only new research by our group and our collaborators, but also associated software. We’re pretty excited about this new direction!"

Why not just replace $W\_q\^T W\_k$ with a  single matrix $W\_{qv}$, and learn the matrix that is the product of  W\_q\^T W\_k instead of the matrices themselves? How does it help to have  two matrices instead of one? And if it helps, why is that not done when  applying matrices between neuron layers?  


Chatgpt tells me that the reason is that it allows the model to learn a different representation for the query and key. But because they are just dotted together, it seems to me that you can just use the original embedding as the query with no loss of generality.

[UPDATE:
Thanks for all of the interesting points! The answer turns out to be because W_q and W_k can map to a lower dimensional space, like two K by k matrix, where k is smaller than K. The mapping to a lower dimensional space lowers the number of parameters to train.

74,machinelearning,chatgpt,top,2024-02-12 16:00:37,[R][P] KV Cache is huge and bottlenecks LLM inference. We quantize them to 2bit in a finetuning-free + plug-and-play fashion.,choHZ,False,0.97,77,1ap3b65,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ap3b65/rp_kv_cache_is_huge_and_bottlenecks_llm_inference/,12,1707753637.0,"It is well known that batch inference is a common practice for efficient LLM serving (which is one primary reason why services like ChatGPT have an initial delay). This batching practice is motivated by the fact that inference latency is mostly limited by the I/O cost of model loading but not the actual compute, where serving multiple requests in a batched manner adds tolerable latency increase while bringing in massive savings on cost per token. However, one issue of batched inference (or long context tasks, or both) is the massive KV cache required. As illustrated in this [previous paper by Jeff Dean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05102): a 500B+ model with `bs=512` and `seqlen=2048` has **a total KV cache about 3TB — this is 3 times the model weight and brings another I/O challenge** as the GPU will need to load the entire KV cache into memory for the next token generation, where, once again, the compute core is mostly idle.

Naturally, various attempts have been made to reduce the size of the KV cache. Some do so by using eviction policy to throw out unimportant tokens (e.g., [StremingLLM](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NG7sS51zVF) and [H2O](https://openreview.net/forum?id=w4IRMAJYPk)); some apply system-level optimizations such as paging or offloading (e.g., [vLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180) and [FlexGen](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RRntzKrBTp)). However, the exploration of vanilla KV Cache quantization — which supposedly brings direct efficiency gain while being compatible with all above-mentioned approaches — has only seen limited performance retention.

We explore the task of KV cache quantization and find **the key challenge is the channel-wise outliers exiting in the Key cache** (channel = a certain index of the `d` dimension of tokens); **we note this is an interesting observation by itself because such pattern does not exist in the Value cache.** Directly quantizing along this channel dimension is challenging, as new tokens arrive in a streaming manner, meaning we’d never know if the next token will include an outlier (or the scale of it). With this in mind, **we present** 🥝**KIVI, where we conduct per-channel quantization for Key cache and per-token quantization for Value cache**, with the help of a small buffer in FP16.

Our method achieves an acceptable performance drop (<1% accuracy drop on average when evaluated against real tasks like LM-Eval and LongBench) with  KV cache quantized in 2bits. This brings 2.6× less peak memory on the Llama/Mistral/Falcon models we evaluated while enabling 4x larger batch size, resulting in 2.35× - 3.47× throughput improvement.

**Abstract**

A major risk of using language models in practical applications is their tendency to hallucinate incorrect statements. Hallucinations are often attributed to knowledge gaps in LMs, but we hypothesize that in some cases, when justifying previously generated hallucinations, LMs output false claims that they can separately recognize as incorrect. We construct three question-answering datasets where ChatGPT and GPT-4 often state an incorrect answer and offer an explanation with at least one incorrect claim. Crucially, we find that ChatGPT and GPT-4 can identify 67% and 87% of their own mistakes, respectively. We refer to this phenomenon as hallucination snowballing: an LM over-commits to early mistakes, leading to more mistakes that it otherwise would not make.

Of course, for text generation use-cases, this makes the most sense.

However, a lot of practical NLP problems can be formulated as classification/ tagging problems. The Pre-ChatGPT systems used to be pretty involved with a lot of moving components (keyword extraction, super long regex, finding nearest vectors in embedding space, etc.).

So, what's actually happening? Are folks replacing specific components with the LLM APIs; or are entire systems being replaced by a series of calls to the LLM APIs? Are BERT-based solutions still used?

Now that the ChatGPT APIs support longer & longer context windows (128k), other than pricing and data privacy concerns, are there any-use cases in which BERT-based/ other solutions would shine; which doesn't require as much compute as models like ChatGPT/ LaMDA/ similar LLMs ?

If it's proprietary data that the said LLM models have no clue about, ofc then you'd be using your own models. But a lot of use-cases seem to revolve around having a general understanding of human language itself (E.g. complaint/ ticket classification/ deriving insights from product reviews).

Any blogs, paper, case-studies, or other write-ups addressing the same will be appreciated. I'd love to hear all of your experiences as well, in case you've worked on/ heard of the aforementioned migration in real-world systems.

This question is specifically asked, keeping in mind NLP use-cases; but feel free to extend your answer to other modalities as well (E.g. combination of tabular & text data)."

Title: Model Dementia: Generated Data Makes Models 

Forget  Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We call this effect model dementia and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet."

I'm kind of surprised - I expected it to be much better than ChatGPT, but results are all over the place (e.g. it is better for few-shot classification, but worse for SQL generation).  


I wonder what makes ChatGPT so decent; given that OpenAI can afford to serve it, it is probably an order of magnitude smaller than LLaMA, yet it is competitive; can RLHF get the model that far?"

Abstract:

>Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs) and their variants, e.g., LLaMA and Vicuna, they remain significantly limited in performing higher-level tasks, such as following human instructions to use external tools (APIs). This is because current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks instead of the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, which have demonstrated excellent tool-use capabilities but are unfortunately closed source. To facilitate **tool-use capabilities within open-source LLMs, we introduce ToolLLM**, a general tool-use framework of data construction, model training and evaluation. We first present **ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use**, which is created automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, we collect 16,464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub, then prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse human instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios. Finally, we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To make the searching process more efficient, we develop a novel **depth-first search-based decision tree (DFSDT), enabling LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space.** We show that **DFSDT significantly enhances the planning and reasoning** capabilities of LLMs. For efficient tool-use assessment, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. We fine-tune LLaMA on ToolBench and obtain ToolLLaMA. Our ToolEval reveals that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits **comparable performance to ChatGPT**. To make the pipeline more practical, we devise a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction, negating the need for manual API selection.

**\[Abstract\]**  Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the paradigm of information retrieval (IR) applications, especially in web search. With their remarkable capabilities in generating human-like texts, LLMs have created enormous texts on the Internet. As a result, IR systems in the LLMs era are facing a new challenge: the indexed documents now are not only written by human beings but also automatically generated by the LLMs. How these LLM-generated documents influence the IR systems is a pressing and still unexplored question. In this work, we conduct a quantitative evaluation of different IR models in scenarios where both human-written and LLM-generated texts are involved. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that neural retrieval models tend to rank LLM-generated documents higher.We refer to this category of biases in neural retrieval models towards the LLM-generated text as the **source bias**. Moreover, we discover that this bias is not confined to the first-stage neural retrievers, but extends to the second-stage neural re-rankers. Then, we provide an in-depth analysis from the perspective of text compression and observe that neural models can better understand the semantic information of LLM-generated text, which is further substantiated by our theoretical analysis. We also discuss the potential server concerns stemming from the observed source bias and hope our findings can serve as a critical wake-up call to the IR community and beyond. To facilitate future explorations of IR in the LLM era, the constructed two new benchmarks and codes will later be available at [https://github.com/KID-22/LLM4IR-Bias](https://github.com/KID-22/LLM4IR-Bias).

This limits their use cases and prohibits more ambitious prompts.

This was recently resolved by researchers at Google Brain in Alberta, Canada. In their recent paper they describe a new method of using associative memory which removes the text limit and they also prove that some large language models are universal Turing machines.

This will pave the way for entire novels being shared with large language models, personal genomes, etc.

The paper talks about the use of ""associative memory"" which is also known as content-addressable memory (CAM). This type of memory allows the system to retrieve data based on its content rather than its location. Unlike traditional memory systems that use specific memory addresses to access data, associative memory uses CAM to find data based on a pattern or keyword.

Presumably, this will open up a new market for associative memory since I would happily pay some extra money for content to be permanently stored in associative memory and to remove the text limit. This will also drive down the price of associative memory if millions of people are willing to pay a monthly fee for storage and the removal of prompt text limits.

The paper does point that there are still problems with conditional statements that confuse the large language models. However, I believe this can be resolved with semantic graphs. This would involve collecting data from various sources and using natural language processing techniques to extract entities and relationships from the text. Once the graph is constructed, it could be integrated into the language model in a variety of ways. One approach is to use the graph as an external memory, similar to the approach taken in the paper. The graph can be encoded as a set of key-value pairs and used to augment the model's attention mechanism during inference. The attention mechanism can then focus on relevant nodes in the graph when generating outputs.

Another potential approach is to incorporate the graph into the model's architecture itself. For example, the graph can be used to inform the initialization of the model's parameters or to guide the attention mechanism during training. This could help the model learn to reason about complex concepts and relationships more effectively, potentially leading to better performance on tasks that require this kind of reasoning.

The use of knowledge graphs can also help ground truth large language models and reduce hallucinations.

When I understand correctly, they let the LLM generate responses that humans have to rank on a scale from 1-5. Then, they train a reward model (I suppose in supervised fashion?) on these ranked outputs. Once that's done, they use reinforcement learning (RL) with proximal policy optimization (PPO) to update the LLM. 

My question is why they use RL with PPO for this last step? Why don't they fine-tune the LLM using regular supervised learning, whereas the human-ranked outputs represent the labels.

## Introduction

General-purpose foundation models, especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in performing various tasks that were once challenging. However, we believe that one model cannot rule them all. Further fine-tuning is necessary to achieve better performance in specialized tasks or domains. The standard approaches for fine-tuning these models include:

* Continuous pretraining on specific domains so that LLMs can acquire knowledge in those domains
* Task tuning on specific tasks so that LLMs can deal with downstream tasks
* Instruction tuning to endow LLMs the ability to comply with specialized natural language instructions and complete tasks required by those instructions
* Alignment tuning to teach LLMs conversational skills in accordance with human preferences.

Alignment, in particular, is crucial for ensuring the safety of LLMs before deployment in the real world. Today we introduce a new alignment algorithm RAFT \[1\] which is more effective than traditional methods such as PPO.  RAFT mitigates the issue of bias that could emerge in LLM responses. Using RAFT for aligning LLMs offers numerous benefits, including the ability to disentangle unwanted biases from the LLM's language production while maintaining fluency levels consistently.

Check out the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06767](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06767).

Its implementation is available from [https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow).

## RAFT Alignment

Alignment is a critical aspect of training large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. One key benefit of alignment is that it helps the model conform to human language habits, improving its performance in tasks such as question answering.

A common approach for alignment involves using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), as described in InstructGPT \[2\]. In this approach,  human labeled data is used to train a reward model. A reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., PPO) is then used to adjust the model's behavior according to the reward model. However, PPO and other reinforcement learning algorithms heavily rely on backpropagation, resulting in high training costs and instability.

To address these issues, we proposed a new alignment algorithm called RAFT (Reward rAnked Fine-Tuning), which uses sample ranking to select the most preferred samples from large models (or samples that align with human values/objective facts), aimed at training AI models that are more human-friendly.

This approach improves the quality of alignment. It is more efficient and stable in training, and it is also easier to implement. We have tested RAFT on both large language models and diffusion models, verifying its effectiveness in question answering and text-to-image generation tasks.

## Algorithm Details

Specifically, RAFT is composed of three core steps:

(1) Data collection: To collect candidate samples before ranking, we can simply use the training generative model as the generator. Furthermore, in order to improve the diversity of generative data, we can also combine sampled results from other pre-trained experts (e.g., LLaMA, ChatGPT, or even human).

(2) Data ranking: Similar to RLHF, we have a classifier or regressor to calculate reward aligned with the target demand. Based on such reward models, we rank the candidate samples and select those with higher reward, which means they better meet human needs.

(3) Model fine-tuning: the samples that best meet human needs are used to fine-tune the model, so that the trained model can match human needs.

Notably, RAFT does not require calculating gradients for every single sampling point. Given a fixed number of data that are used for fine-tuning, RAFT performs more forward passes of sampling and then filters out most low-quality data by the reward function, which makes the model more stable and robust. At the same time, in some cases, due to the lower sensitivity of supervised fine-tuning to hyperparameters and more robust convergence, under the same reward conditions, we found that RAFT can have better perplexity (corresponding to better generation diversity and fluency).

[The experiment result of movie review completion on IMDB dataset](https://preview.redd.it/f7ri2e941hua1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=edd47491741a30a07bc7f350c3b25d0c21a49e0a)

The full algorithm is shown as follows:

[RAFT Algorithm](https://preview.redd.it/hh0rmxe51hua1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c60caf0e022d9cce46af1f311970ede6cd47c5e6)

We performed experiments on a range of tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of RAFT.

Firstly, we evaluated the performance in completing positive movie reviews. Before fine-tuning, LLaMA’s output movie reviews were random and occasionally negative. However, after fine-tuning with RAFT, it excelled at generating more positive, fluent movie reviews when given a starting sentence for the review. As shown in the figure below, unadjusted movie reviews by LLaMA would randomly output positive and negative reviews, while both RAFT and PPO were able to incline towards positive reviews.

https://preview.redd.it/q86aawc81hua1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=392f843a889757ff2e740bc125d7d6f02afe6b30

The authors also created a psychological companion robot based on Vicuna. The authors simulate a conversation between a person who is feeling down due to failing an exam and the robot. Before using RAFT for alignment (left image), the model claimed to have no emotions or feelings and refused to be friends with humans. However, after RAFT alignment (right image), the model's empathetic abilities were significantly enhanced and it repeatedly comforted the human by saying, ""Although I am an AI, I will try my best to be your friend.""

[Vicuna-13B](https://preview.redd.it/4tn9ocz91hua1.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e6e8ee235550a11f8dfd5dce7cb016ab9835014)

In addition to evaluating RAFT’s effectiveness on language models, we also tested its ability to improve text-to-image generation in diffusion models. As it is well known, the original stable diffusion does not perform well at 256\*256 resolution and PPO cannot be directly applied to stable diffusion models. In contrast, RAFT provides a natural way to improve it. After fine-tuning with RAFT, stable diffusion is able to generate good results. This is undoubtedly a benefit for AIGC enthusiasts with limited computing resources, as the time required for 256\*256 resolution is only 20% of the original version. The following figure shows the results before and after fine-tuning with RAFT. As can be seen, prior to fine-tuning, stable diffusion struggled to generate good 256\*256 resolution images, but the model was greatly improved in terms of image generation quality after fine-tuning.

[Resolution Adaptation. \(RAFT-aligned models can generate proper 256 × 256 samples\)](https://preview.redd.it/twolxcxd1hua1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c15b23249f6d4d041b7ee3c4293e685ccbc126d2)

In addition to improving the generation ability of 256\*256 images, RAFT can also align the generated images with the prompts, enabling the model to generate images that better match the prompt description. As shown in the figure below, given the prompt ""Monet style cat"" the original stable diffusion generated pictures that mostly did not include a cat, but instead generated other works in the style of Monet. This was because cats are rarely seen in Monet's works, and stable diffusion did not fully understand the meaning of the text. However, after fine-tuning with RAFT, stable diffusion was able to understand the concept of a ""cat,"" and so there is a cat in every generated image.

⭐️ [https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow)

LMFlow has a complete  fine-tuning workflow for a large foundation model to support personalized training with limited computing resources. It supports the following essential features:

* Continuous pretraining, task tuning, instruction tuning, and alignment tuning on datasets defined by the user.
* Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA
* A new alignment algorithm RAFT (Reward rAnked Fine Tuning), which streamlines the alignment pipeline for generative models.
* A straightforward and easily adaptable API for developers.
* A simplified model inference framework.

Based on a 7 billion parameter LLaMA model, it only takes one Nvidia 3090 GPU and five hours to train a personalized model. We used this framework to train a 33-billion-parameter version of LLaMA on a single machine and have released the model weights for academic research. The trained model weights can be immediately used for a question-and-answer service on the website (lmflow.com).

Using LMFlow, anyone can train their own personalized model! Each person can choose the appropriate model according to their available resources, for tasks such as Q&A, companionship, writing, translation, and expert consultations in various fields. The larger the model and data size, the longer the training time provided the better the results. Currently, we trained a 33B model and achieved comparable or even better performance than ChatGPT.

1. We can get (lots of) funding for the training, hardware, etc...
2. The end product should be on-premises
3. The inference does not actually need to run very quickly. If it costs millions to buy enough GPUs just due to VRAM limitations, we could simply run on CPUs and utilize ram, as long as inference could be done a few times per day.

**Evaluations**

1. Retrieving Supporting Evidence for LLMs Generated Answers (University of Waterloo): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13781.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14627v1.pdf). The study investigates a method to automatically verify responses generated by large language models (LLMs) using a corpus. The experiment involves presenting a question to the LLM, receiving a generated answer, and then querying the corpus with the combination of the question and generated answer. The LLM is then asked to verify if the generated answer is supported by the retrieved answer. This experiment uses the MS MARCO (V1) test collection, with three retrieval methods. Results indicate that LLMs can verify their answers given appropriate supporting material, but with 70-80% accuracy, the method is not completely reliable in detecting hallucinations. Significant improvements are reported compared to other methods on three different datasets.
2. Self-contradictory Hallucinations of Large Language Models: Evaluation, Detection and Mitigation (ETH Zurich): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15852.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15852.pdf). This study focuses on self-contradictions in large language models (large LMs), including their evaluation, detection, and mitigation. The researchers created a framework to elicit self-contradictions and found they're common across different LMs and topic types. The study shows ChatGPT and GPT-4 perform well at identifying self-contradictions, while Vicuna-13B struggles. An iterative algorithm was developed to help LMs eliminate self-contradictions while retaining fluency and informativeness. The approach applies to black-box LMs and needs no external grounded knowledge.
3. Detecting and Mitigating Hallucinations in Multilingual Summarisation (University of Edinburgh, University of Cambridge): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13632v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13632v1.pdf). This research addresses the issue of hallucinations (unfaithful summaries) in neural models used for abstractive summarisation, particularly in cross-lingual settings. A new metric, mFACT, is developed to assess the faithfulness of non-English summaries, using translation-based transfer from existing English faithfulness metrics. A method is also proposed to minimize hallucinations in cross-lingual transfer, where the loss of each training example is weighted by its faithfulness score. Through extensive experiments, mFACT proved the most suitable for detecting hallucinations. The suggested loss weighting method significantly improved performance and faithfulness, surpassing strong baselines such as MAD-X. The authors have shared their code and dataset online.
4. RefGPT: Reference → Truthful & Customized Dialogues Generation by GPTs and for GPTs (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14994.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14994.pdf). The abstract discusses a method called RefGPT, proposed to generate accurate and personalized dialogues, solving issues with current Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which tend to generate incorrect information (hallucination). RefGPT generates dialogue by using given references, not just the model's own knowledge, and it provides detailed control for better customization. The researchers also introduce two datasets created using GPT-4: RefGPT-Fact (100k factual multi-turn dialogues) and RefGPT-Code (76k multi-turn dialogues for coding scenarios). The resources are available on GitHub.
5. ALIGNSCORE: Evaluating Factual Consistency with A Unified Alignment Function (UC San Diego): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16739.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16739.pdf). This abstract discusses a new approach to automatically evaluate factual consistency in text generation using a unified training framework called ALIGNSCORE. The model incorporates a diverse array of data sources from seven different tasks, resulting in 4.7 million training examples. Extensive testing on large-scale benchmarks, including 22 previously unseen datasets, shows that ALIGNSCORE significantly outperforms existing metrics. Despite its size of 355M parameters, it matches or even surpasses the performance of larger metrics based on ChatGPT and GPT-4.
6. HaRiM+: Evaluating Summary Quality with Hallucination Risk (NCSOFT NLP Center): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12118v2.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12118v2.pdf). This study reinterprets the decoder overconfidence-regularizing objective from a previous work as a hallucination risk measurement for estimating the quality of generated summaries. The researchers introduce HaRiM+, a reference-free metric that calculates hallucination risk based on token likelihoods using only an existing summarization model. HaRiM+ doesn't need additional model training or ad-hoc modules, and aligns well with human judgment on three summary-quality annotation sets: FRANK, QAGS, and SummEval. This work could aid in improving automated summary evaluation and generation.

**Benchmarks**

1. TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods (Open AI, University of Oxford): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07958.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07958.pdf). The abstract introduces a benchmark for measuring the truthfulness of language models in generating answers. It consists of 817 questions across various categories. The questions are designed to challenge models with false beliefs or misconceptions. GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J, GPT-2, and a T5-based model were tested. The best model was truthful in 58% of the questions, while humans achieved 94% accuracy. Models often produced false answers that imitated popular misconceptions and could potentially mislead humans. Interestingly, larger models were generally less truthful, in contrast to other NLP tasks. Scaling up models alone is deemed less effective in improving truthfulness, suggesting the importance of fine-tuning with alternative training objectives.
2. Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (CRFM, HAI- Stanford University): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09110.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09110.pdf). The study introduces the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM), aimed at improving transparency in understanding language models' capabilities, risks, and limitations. The approach involves taxonomizing various scenarios and metrics relevant to language models and evaluating a subset of these, considering what's missing or underrepresented. It measures seven metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, efficiency) across 16 core scenarios, ensuring that all aspects are considered. In addition, HELM conducts targeted evaluations on specific aspects, like knowledge, reasoning, and disinformation. A comprehensive evaluation of 30 significant language models on 42 scenarios, some of which have not been used in mainstream evaluation, was carried out, with results indicating 25 key findings regarding the interaction of various scenarios, metrics, and models. HELM aims to serve as a continuously updated benchmark tool for the community.
3. HaluEval: A Large-Scale Hallucination Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models (Renmin University of China, Université de Montréal): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11747v2.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11747v2.pdf). The study introduces the Hallucination Evaluation for Large Language Models (HaluEval), a benchmark tool for examining the tendency of large language models like ChatGPT to generate hallucinated content—information not rooted in the source or unverifiable. This was done through a two-step ChatGPT-based framework, generating and annotating a large collection of samples. The results indicate that ChatGPT can create unverifiable information in response to 11.4% of user queries, suggesting difficulty in recognizing hallucinated content. However, enhancing hallucination recognition is possible with external knowledge or additional reasoning steps.
4. A Token-level Reference-free Hallucination Detection Benchmark for Free-form Text Generation (Peaking uni, Microsoft, Tencent, Xiaowei, Meta): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08704v2.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08704v2.pdf). This paper presents a new approach to addressing the issue of hallucination (generating incorrect or non-existent content) in large pre-trained models like GPT3. Rather than using sentence or document level detection, it proposes a token-level, reference-free hallucination detection task and introduces a new dataset, HADES (HAllucination DEtection dataSet), for this purpose. The dataset is created by modifying text segments from English Wikipedia and verifying them with crowdsourced annotations. To combat label imbalance, an iterative model-in-loop strategy is employed. Multiple baseline models are created following thorough data analyses.
5. Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations (Princeton University): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14627v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14627v1.pdf). This study introduces ALCE, the first benchmark for evaluating automatic citation generation in large language models (LLMs). Noting that LLMs often ""hallucinate"" or fabricate information, the researchers aim to improve their factual accuracy and verifiability by having them generate text with citations. ALCE amasses a variety of questions and retrieval corpora, calling for the creation of comprehensive systems to find supporting evidence and generate answers with references. The researchers create automatic metrics for fluency, correctness, and citation quality, all of which correlate strongly with human assessments. Tests reveal that current systems, including state-of-the-art LLMs, could improve, as evidenced by the finding that 49% of responses from the best model on the ELI5 dataset lacked full citation support. The research concludes by suggesting areas for further investigation, such as developing better information retrievers, advancing long-context LLMs, and enhancing the synthesis of information from multiple sources.
6. Diving Deep into Modes of Fact Hallucinations in Dialogue Systems (University at Buffalo): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04449v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04449v1.pdf). This research addresses the issue of fact hallucination in Knowledge Graph (KG) grounded chatbots, a problem where entities not referenced in knowledge sources or conversation history are inaccurately introduced into responses. Prior solutions have tweaked training procedures or used multi-step refining methods, but there's been little focus on developing an entity-level hallucination detection system. This paper investigates different types of hallucination in KG-grounded chatbots via human feedback analysis, introduces a series of perturbation strategies to create a synthetic dataset named FADE (FActual Dialogue Hallucination DEtection Dataset), and evaluates multiple baseline models for hallucination detection against human-verified data and established benchmarks.
7. FAITHDIAL: A Faithful Benchmark for Information-Seeking Dialogue (Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10757.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10757.pdf). FAITHDIAL, a new benchmark for hallucination-free dialogues, was created to improve the faithfulness of information-seeking dialogue systems. This benchmark edits unsupported utterances (hallucinations) in the Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) benchmark. It was found to be more reliable than WoW while sustaining engaging dialogues. FAITHDIAL effectively serves as a training signal for a hallucination critic, boosting performance by 12.8 F1 score on the BEGIN benchmark, and promotes high-quality dialogue generation. It has demonstrated utility in zero-shot transfer on datasets like CMU-Dog and TopicalChat. Moreover, human evaluations found FAITHDIAL-trained models produce more interpretable, cooperative, and engaging responses.
8. Evaluating the Factual Consistency of Large Language Models Through Summarization (UNC Chapel Hill): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08412.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08412.pdf). The authors introduce the Factual Inconsistency Benchmark (FIB), a new tool designed to assess the factual consistency of large language models (LLMs) in summarization tasks. The benchmark gauges the accuracy of models by comparing scores they assign to factually consistent and inconsistent summaries. Evaluation of 23 LLMs, including models like BLOOM and OPT, reveals that LLMs generally prefer factually consistent summaries, although they tend to favor factually inconsistent ones if they appear verbatim in the source document. The FIB benchmark, code, and data are publicly available.

**Enhancements**

1. On Exposure Bias, Hallucination and Domain Shift in Neural Machine Translation (Stanford University): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03642.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03642.pdf). This paper explores the role of exposure bias in neural machine translation (NMT) and its connection to the issue of ""hallucinations"" under domain shift. The authors establish that exposure bias contributes to these hallucinations. They further demonstrate, through trials on three datasets, that using Minimum Risk Training, an algorithm that minimizes exposure bias, can lessen hallucinations. They also examine why exposure bias worsens during domain shifts and its connection to the beam search problem - performance degradation with increasing beam size. The findings justify methods to reduce exposure bias, which, despite not enhancing in-domain test set performance, improve model robustness during domain shifts.
2. Certified Reasoning with Language Models (Stanford University): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04031.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04031.pdf). The abstract discusses the development of 'guides' for language models to enhance their reasoning abilities. These guides, such as LOGICGUIDE, use state and incremental constraints to steer the models towards valid statements. They help models formalize assumptions, ensuring sound reasoning. LOGICGUIDE significantly boosts the performance of language models like GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and LLaMA in reasoning tasks, with accuracy gains of up to 35%. It also minimizes content effects, or the interference of prior and current assumptions. Moreover, LOGICGUIDE allows LLaMA to self-improve by learning from its verified self-generated reasoning, preventing learning from hallucinations.
3. Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (Stanford University): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03872.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09110.pdf). The paper introduces the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM), aimed at improving the transparency of language models. HELM characterizes a broad array of use cases and metrics of interest for language models, also identifying underrepresented areas. It utilizes a multi-metric approach, measuring seven metrics across 16 core scenarios 87.5% of the time to reveal trade-offs across models and metrics. It also includes seven targeted evaluations for a more in-depth analysis of specific aspects. HELM evaluates 30 prominent language models on 42 scenarios, significantly improving benchmark coverage from an average of 17.9% to 96.0%. The study results in 25 top-level findings on the interaction of scenarios, metrics, and models. All raw prompts and completions are made public, and a toolkit is provided to facilitate future updates and additions to HELM.
4. CRITIC: Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Tool-Interactive Critiquing (Microsoft): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11738.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11738.pdf). The abstract discusses the development of a framework named CRITIC, designed to mitigate issues in large language models (LLMs) such as generating flawed content or hallucinating facts. CRITIC, inspired by human interaction with tools for refinement, enables LLMs to validate and improve their own outputs. It uses relevant tools to assess and revise initial text based on received feedback. Trials involving free-form question answering, mathematical program synthesis, and toxicity reduction suggest CRITIC enhances LLMs' performance and underscores the significance of external feedback in LLMs' continuous self-improvement.
5. PURR: Efficiently Editing Language Model Hallucinations by Denoising Language Model Corruptions (UC Irvine, Google): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14908v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14908v1.pdf). Large language models can generate false claims or ""hallucinations"", a problem being addressed by recent research through prompt-based editing. However, the use of large language models for editing has significant cost and speed issues. This study presents a solution by training compact editors to denoise text corrupted by large language models in an unsupervised way, creating faux hallucinations for training purposes. Their model, Petite Unsupervised Research and Revision (PURR), improves attribution and offers significantly faster execution times over existing methods.
6. Hallucinated but Factual! Inspecting the Factuality of Hallucinations in Abstractive Summarization (McGill University): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09784v2.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09784v2.pdf). State-of-the-art abstractive summarization systems often produce hallucinations, generating content not directly inferred from the source. Surprisingly, many of these hallucinations are factual and can provide valuable background information in summaries. This paper introduces a novel detection method that distinguishes factual from non-factual hallucinations of entities using prior and posterior probabilities from masked language models. The approach outperforms baselines and aligns well with human judgments. When used as a reward signal in reinforcement learning, the detector significantly enhances summary factuality while preserving abstractiveness.
7. Controlled Hallucinations: Learning to Generate Faithfully from Noisy Data (Google): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05873v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05873v1.pdf). Neural text generation performs well with abundant training data, but this is not always available. Heuristic rules used to collect parallel data introduce noise, causing models to generate unsupported text. We propose a technique to control and acknowledge these hallucinations without modifying the model architecture. We test its effectiveness on the noisy WikiBio corpus, evaluating both automatically and with human input.
8. Adversarial Feature Hallucination Networks for Few-Shot Learning (Northeastern University): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13193v2.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13193.pdf). This paper presents a new approach for few-shot learning (FSL), a method used when only a small amount of labeled data is available. The proposed Adversarial Feature Hallucination Networks (AFHN) uses conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial networks (cWGAN) to create diverse and discriminative features based on limited samples. The AFHN model integrates two novel regularizers, a classification regularizer and an anti-collapse regularizer, to enhance the discriminability and diversity of these features. Comparative results from three common benchmarks indicate that AFHN outperforms other data augmentation-based FSL strategies and current leading methods.
9. Improving Language Models via Plug-and-Play Retrieval Feedback (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14002.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14002.pdf). This paper introduces REFEED, a pipeline that enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating automatic retrieval feedback. LLMs often generate incorrect or hallucinated information, limiting their practical applicability. Human feedback improves factuality but is resource-intensive and impractical during inference. REFEED generates initial outputs, retrieves relevant information from large document collections, and incorporates it for output refinement. Experiments show that REFEED improves performance by +6.0% (zero-shot) and +2.5% (few-shot) compared to baselines without retrieval feedback.
10. Controlling Hallucinations at Word Level in Data-to-Text Generation (Clement Rebuffel, Marco Roberti, Laure Soulier, Geoffrey Scoutheeten, Rossella Cancelliere, Patrick Gallinari): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02810.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02810v2.pdf). Data-to-Text Generation (DTG) involves converting structured data into natural language descriptions, with modern methods involving neural-based generators. However, these methods often include misleading statements or ""hallucinations."" This paper addresses this issue with a novel Multi-Branch Decoder that treats hallucinations at the word level. The model leverages word level labels derived from co-occurrence analysis and dependency parsing to learn from each training instance. Evaluations on the WikiBio benchmark show the model's accuracy and effectiveness, reducing hallucinations while maintaining fluency and coherence, even in noisy settings.
11. SELFCHECKGPT: Zero-Resource Black-Box Hallucination Detection for Generative Large Language Models (University of Cambridge): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08896v2.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08896v2.pdf). The abstract presents a study on ""SelfCheckGPT,"" a sampling-based method to fact-check large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 without needing an external database. It exploits the tendency of LLMs to produce similar, consistent facts for a concept, while hallucinated facts result in divergent, inconsistent samples. The method's efficiency was tested on GPT-3 generated passages about individuals from the WikiBio dataset. Results indicated that SelfCheckGPT could effectively identify factual and non-factual sentences and assess passage factuality. Its performance in hallucination detection matched or exceeded grey-box methods.
12. Mutual Information Alleviates Hallucinations in Abstractive Summarization (ETH Zurich): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13210v2.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13210v2.pdf). This paper investigates the issue of ""hallucination"" in abstractive summarization models, where they generate content unsupported by the original text. The research identifies high model uncertainty as a key factor causing such hallucinations, with models preferring high-frequency phrases from the training set when unsure about the next output. To combat this, the paper proposes a decoding strategy that focuses on the mutual information between source and target tokens rather than just the target token's probability during periods of model uncertainty. Experiments on the XSUM dataset demonstrate a decrease in hallucination occurrences while maintaining strong ROUGE and BERTS scores.
13. RHO (ρ): Reducing Hallucination in Open-domain Dialogues with Knowledge Grounding (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01588.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01588.pdf). The paper presents RHO, a method to improve dialogue systems by reducing ""hallucinated"" responses unsupported by the input source. The technique involves integrating information from a knowledge graph (KG) into the dialogue context. This is achieved by (1) locally grounding knowledge, which combines textual embeddings with KG embeddings, and (2) globally grounding knowledge, which gives RHO multi-hop reasoning abilities via attention mechanisms. The method also includes a response re-ranking technique based on KG sub-graph walks for improved reasoning. Experimental results show RHO significantly outperforms existing methods in reducing hallucination and overall performance.
14. MoFE: Mixture of Factual Experts for Controlling Hallucinations in Abstractive Summarization (Anonymous): [https://openreview.net/pdf?id=JegLdW0zORF](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=JegLdW0zORF). Neural abstractive summarization models often produce factually incorrect content, known as hallucination. To address this, the Mixture of Factual Experts (MoFE) model is proposed, which unites several summarization experts targeting different factual errors. The MoFE model combines these experts using weights and logits ensembling techniques. This strategy offers a modular solution to control factual inaccuracies while upholding performance on standard ROUGE metrics.
15. Reducing Hallucinations in Neural Machine Translation with Feature Attribution (Imperial College London): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09878.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09878.pdf). This abstract discusses the issue of hallucinations in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models that arise due to low-quality training data. The authors present a case study, first utilizing feature attribution methods to understand the behavior of an NMT model producing hallucinations. Subsequently, these methods are leveraged to propose a new loss function aimed at reducing hallucinations. This proposed solution importantly does not necessitate retraining the model from the beginning.
16. Optimal Transport for Unsupervised Hallucination Detection in Neural Machine Translation (Multiple EU schools): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09631.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09631.pdf). This paper tackles the issue of hallucination detection in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), where models can generate incorrect translations detached from the source content. The proposed solution is a fully unsupervised, plug-in detector that uses an optimal transport formulation to identify distinct cross-attention patterns characteristic of hallucinations. The detector is compatible with any attention-based NMT model. Experiments demonstrated that this detector outperforms prior model-based detectors and rivals those using external models trained on large sample sets.
17. Trapping LLM “Hallucinations” Using Tagged Context Prompts (UMD Baltimore): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06085.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06085.pdf). This paper addresses the issue of hallucinations in large language models like ChatGPT, which generate false or fabricated information. The authors propose a novel method using context and embedded tags to identify and flag instances of model-generated data outside its domain knowledge. By adding context to question prompts, they significantly reduce overall hallucination frequency in generative language models. Additionally, placing tags within contexts effectively eliminates hallucinations in model responses with 98.88% effectiveness.
18. Contrastive Learning Reduces Hallucination in Conversations (Shandong University, University of Amsterdam): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10400.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10400.pdf). The abstract discusses MixCL, a contrastive learning scheme designed to address ""hallucination"" in pre-trained language models (LMs), where these models generate irrelevant or factually incorrect responses. The proposed mixed contrastive objective optimizes the knowledge elicitation process of LMs to minimize hallucination. The effectiveness of MixCL is evaluated through experiments on Wizard-of-Wikipedia, a dialogue benchmark. Results show that MixCL reduces hallucination and improves relevancy and factuality in LM-based dialogue agents, matching performance levels of knowledge-based models, but with greater efficiency and scalability.

**Surveys**

1. Survey of Hallucination in Natural Language Generation (Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAiRE), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03629.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03629.pdf). This survey examines the progress and challenges in addressing hallucinated texts in Natural Language Generation (NLG). It discusses advancements in NLG using deep learning models like Transformer-based language models, leading to improved performance in tasks such as abstractive summarization and dialogue generation. However, the survey highlights the issue of unintended text hallucinations and the negative impact on system performance. It provides an overview of metrics, mitigation methods, and future directions for tackling hallucination in NLG. The survey also covers task-specific research progress in abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, generative question answering, data-to-text generation, machine translation, and visual-language generation. The aim of the survey is to facilitate collaboration among researchers to overcome the challenge of hallucinated texts in NLG.
2. On the Origin of Hallucinations in Conversational Models: Is it the Datasets or the Models? (IBM research, University of Alberta, Mcgill University): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07931v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07931v1.pdf). This study explores the causes of factually incorrect statements, known as hallucination, in knowledge-grounded conversational models. The researchers conducted a human study on popular benchmarks and state-of-the-art models, revealing that over 60% of the responses were hallucinated. These findings highlight concerns about the quality of datasets and models currently used, with annotations provided for further research.
3. Probing Causes of Hallucinations in Neural Machine Translations (WeChat AI, Tencent, China): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12529v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12529v1.pdf). The abstract discusses the issue of hallucination in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Hallucination refers to the generation of fluent but irrelevant translations. The study aims to understand the causes of hallucination through probing methods and improve future architecture designs. The experiments reveal that hallucination is often associated with deficiencies in the encoder, particularly with embeddings, and vulnerable cross-attentions. Interestingly, cross-attention helps to mitigate some errors caused by the encoder."

I have worked at two FAANGS on ml research teams/platforms. 

My opinion is that GPT-4 Vision/Image processing is out of science fiction. I fed chatgpt an image of a complex sql data base schema, and it converted it to code, then optimized the schema. It understood the arrows pointing between table boxes on the image as relations, and even understand many to one/many to many. 

I took a picture of random writing on a page, and it did OCR better than has ever been possible. I was able to ask questions that required OCR and a geometrical understanding of the page layout. 

Where is the hype on here? This is an astounding human breakthrough. I cannot believe how much ML is now obsolete as a result. I cannot believe how many computer science breakthroughs have occurred with this simple model update. Where is the uproar on this sub?

I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

CAIDP claims that OpenAI's AI text generation tools have been ""biased, deceptive, and a risk to public safety.""

CAIDP's complaint raises concerns about potential threats from OpenAI's GPT-4 generative text model, which was announced in mid-March. It warns of the potential for GPT-4 to produce malicious code and highly tailored propaganda and the risk that biased training data could result in baked-in stereotypes or unfair race and gender preferences in hiring. 

The complaint also mentions significant privacy failures with OpenAI's product interface, such as a recent bug that exposed OpenAI ChatGPT histories and possibly payment details of ChatGPT plus subscribers.

CAIDP seeks to hold OpenAI accountable for violating Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive trade practices. The complaint claims that OpenAI knowingly released GPT-4 to the public for commercial use despite the risks, including potential bias and harmful behavior.

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1703961405999759638) shows the style of prompts that are being used to get these results with the new language model.

I used website parrotchess\[dot\]com (discovered [here](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1704179448013070560)) to play multiple games of chess purportedly pitting this new language model vs. various levels at website Lichess, which supposedly uses Fairy-Stockfish 14 according to the Lichess user interface. My current results for all completed games: The language model is 5-0 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/eGSWJtNq), [game 2](https://lichess.org/pN7K9bdS), [game 3](https://lichess.org/aK4jQvdo), [game 4](https://lichess.org/S9SGg8YI), [game 5](https://lichess.org/OqzdkDhE)), and 2-5 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 6 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/zP68C6H4), [game 2](https://lichess.org/4XKUIDh1), [game 3](https://lichess.org/1zTasRRp), [game 4](https://lichess.org/lH1EMqJQ), [game 5](https://lichess.org/mdFlTbMn), [game 6](https://lichess.org/HqmELNhw), [game 7](https://lichess.org/inWVs05Q)). Not included in the tally are games that I had to abort because the parrotchess user interface stalled (5 instances), because I accidentally copied a move incorrectly in the parrotchess user interface (numerous instances), or because the parrotchess user interface doesn't allow the promotion of a pawn to anything other than queen (1 instance). **Update: There could have been up to 5 additional losses - the number of times the parrotchess user interface stalled - that would have been recorded in this tally if** [this language model resignation bug](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1705894692603269503) **hadn't been present. Also, the quality of play of some online chess bots can perhaps vary depending on the speed of the user's hardware.**

The following is a screenshot from parrotchess showing the end state of the first game vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5:

The game results in this paragraph are from using parrotchess after the forementioned resignation bug was fixed. The language model is 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish level 7 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/Se3t7syX)), and 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 8 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/j3W2OwrP)).

There are several other ways to play chess against the new language model if you have access to the OpenAI API. The first way is to use the OpenAI Playground as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CReHXhmMprg). The second way is chess web app gptchess\[dot\]vercel\[dot\]app (discovered in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/willdepue/status/1703974001717154191) / [Nitter thread](https://nitter.net/willdepue/status/1703974001717154191)).

From blog post [Playing chess with large language models](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2023/chess-llm.html):

>Computers have been better than humans at chess for at least the last 25 years. And for the past five years, deep learning models have been better than the best humans. But until this week, in order to be good at chess, a machine learning model had to be explicitly designed to play games: it had to be told explicitly that there was an 8x8 board, that there were different pieces, how each of them moved, and what the goal of the game was. Then it had to be trained with reinforcement learning agaist itself. And then it would win.  
>  
>This all changed on Monday, when OpenAI released GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct, an instruction-tuned language model that was designed to just write English text, but that people on the internet quickly discovered can play chess at, roughly, the level of skilled human players.

Post [Chess as a case study in hidden capabilities in ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6vH6fr8ngo7csDdf/chess-as-a-case-study-in-hidden-capabilities-in-chatgpt) from last month covers a different prompting style used for the older chat-based GPT 3.5 Turbo language model. If I recall correctly from my tests with ChatGPT-3.5, using that prompt style with the older language model can defeat Stockfish level 2 at Lichess, but I haven't been successful in using it to beat Stockfish level 3. In my tests, both the quality of play and frequency of illegal attempted moves seems to be better with the new prompt style with the new language model compared to the older prompt style with the older language model.

P.S. Since some people claim that language model gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is always playing moves memorized from the training dataset, I searched for data on the uniqueness of chess positions. From [this video](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2225), we see that for a certain game dataset there were 763,331,945 chess positions encountered in an unknown number of games without removing duplicate chess positions, 597,725,848 different chess positions reached, and 582,337,984 different chess positions that were reached only once. Therefore, for that game dataset the probability that a chess position in a game was reached only once is 582337984 / 763331945 = 76.3%. For the larger dataset [cited](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2187) in that video, there are approximately (506,000,000 - 200,000) games in the dataset (per [this paper](http://tom7.org/chess/survival.pdf)), and 21,553,382,902 different game positions encountered. Each game in the larger dataset added a mean of approximately 21,553,382,902 / (506,000,000 - 200,000) = 42.6 different chess positions to the dataset. For [this different dataset](https://lichess.org/blog/Vs0xMTAAAD4We4Ey/opening-explorer) of \~12 million games, \~390 million different chess positions were encountered. Each game in this different dataset added a mean of approximately (390 million / 12 million) = 32.5 different chess positions to the dataset. From the aforementioned numbers, we can conclude that a strategy of playing only moves memorized from a game dataset would fare poorly because there are not rarely new chess games that have chess positions that are not present in the game dataset."

With that said, I'm also hopeful that competitors like [Silatus](https://silatus.com/) and [Durable](https://durable.co/), which already use multiple models, consider using open-source models like Mistral into their frameworks.

Some people around me say they are not that impressed by what AIs can do, so I built a small test (with a little help by chatGPT to code the whole thing): can you always 100% distinguish between AI art or text and old works of art or literature?

Here is the site: http://aiorart.com/

I find that AI-generated text is still generally easy to spot, but of course it is very challenging to go against great literary works. AI images can sometimes be truly deceptive.

This is a massive, massive deal.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

1. Firstly, I noticed my iPhone heats up and does things like reducing screen brightness -- which is what I normally see it do when im doing something computationally intensive for an iPhone, like using photo or video editing apps.
2. I also noticed that if I start a conversation on the iPhone app and then resume it on the browser, I get a message saying ""The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model."" I get this message regardless of if I use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, but NOT if I use GPT-4 with plugins or web-browsing.

This, along with the fact that OpenAI took 8 months to release what one might have considered to be relatively simple web-app -- and that they've only released it so far on iOS, which has a pretty uniform and consistent environment when it comes to machine learning hardware (the Apple Neural Engine) -- makes me thing that they are experimenting with GPT models that are conducing at least SOME of their machine learning inference ON the device, rather than through the cloud.

It wouldn't be shocking if they were -- ever since Meta's LLaMA models were released into the wild, we've seen absolutely mind-blowing advances in terms of people creating more efficient and effective models with smaller parameter sizes. We've also seen LLMs to start working on less and less powerful devices, such as consumer-grade computers / smartphones / etc.

This, plus the rumors that OpenAI might be releasing their own open-source model to the public in the near future makes me think that the ChatGPT app might in fact be a first step toward GPT systems running at least PARTIALLY on devices locally.

Curious what anyone else here has observed or thinks."

So I work at a company as an AI/ML engineer on a smart replies project. Our team develops ML models to understand conversation between a user and its contact and generate multiple smart suggestions for the user to reply with, like the ones that come in gmail or linkedin. Existing models were performing well on this task, while more models were in the pipeline.

But with the release of ChatGPT, particularly its API, everything changed. It performed better than our model, quite obvious with the amount of data is was trained on, and is cheap with moderate rate limits.

Seeing its performance, higher management got way too excited and have now put all their faith in ChatGPT API. They are even willing to ignore privacy, high response time, unpredictability, etc. concerns.

They have asked us to discard and dump most of our previous ML models, stop experimenting any new models and for most of our cases use the ChatGPT API.

Not only my team, but the higher management is planning to replace all ML models in our entire software by ChatGPT, effectively rendering all ML based teams useless.

Now there is low key talk everywhere in the organization that after integration of ChatGPT API, most of the ML based teams will be disbanded and their team members fired, as a cost cutting measure. Big layoffs coming soon."

Preliminary evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge shows Vicuna-13B achieves more than 90%\* quality of OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard while outperforming other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca in more than 90%\* of cases. The cost of training Vicuna-13B is around $300. The training and serving [code](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), along with an online [demo](https://chat.lmsys.org/), are publicly available for non-commercial use.

# Training details

Vicuna is created by fine-tuning a LLaMA base model using approximately 70K user-shared conversations gathered from ShareGPT.com with public APIs. To ensure data quality, we convert the HTML back to markdown and filter out some inappropriate or low-quality samples. Additionally, we divide lengthy conversations into smaller segments that fit the model’s maximum context length.

Our training recipe builds on top of [Stanford’s alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) with the following improvements.

* **Memory Optimizations:** To enable Vicuna’s understanding of long context, we expand the max context length from 512 in alpaca to 2048, which substantially increases GPU memory requirements. We tackle the memory pressure by utilizing [gradient checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174) and [flash attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135).
* **Multi-round conversations:** We adjust the training loss to account for multi-round conversations and compute the fine-tuning loss solely on the chatbot’s output.
* **Cost Reduction via Spot Instance:** The 40x larger dataset and 4x sequence length for training poses a considerable challenge in training expenses. We employ [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) [managed spot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/spot-jobs.html) to reduce the cost by leveraging the cheaper spot instances with auto-recovery for preemptions and auto zone switch. This solution slashes costs for training the 7B model from $500 to around $140 and the 13B model from around $1K to $300.

# Limitations

We have noticed that, similar to other large language models, Vicuna has certain limitations. For instance, it is not good at tasks involving reasoning or mathematics, and it may have limitations in accurately identifying itself or ensuring the factual accuracy of its outputs. Additionally, it has not been sufficiently optimized to guarantee safety or mitigate potential toxicity or bias. To address the safety concerns, we use the OpenAI [moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview) API to filter out inappropriate user inputs in our online demo. Nonetheless, we anticipate that Vicuna can serve as an open starting point for future research to tackle these limitations.

In this case it was ChatGPT (3.5, the free version); but I can see this happening in any model.

Here's the prompt I used on a fresh session:

""Generate 60 random numbers coming from an exponential distribution with lambda=6.4. Don't write any code""

It outputs the following values:

0.013, 0.078, 0.266, 0.040, 0.117, 0.283, 0.048, 0.078, 0.181, 0.134, 0.017, 0.160, 0.052, 0.196, 0.096, 0.098, 0.019, 0.048, 0.141, 0.071, 0.106, 0.023, 0.197, 0.062, 0.029, 0.072, 0.111, 0.166, 0.080, 0.027, 0.124, 0.016, 0.135, 0.052, 0.078, 0.161, 0.078, 0.139, 0.068, 0.066, 0.039, 0.056, 0.018, 0.082, 0.180, 0.086, 0.024, 0.022, 0.057, 0.042, 0.050, 0.104, 0.099, 0.062, 0.016, 0.186, 0.043, 0.085, 0.145, 0.110.

I get to plot a histogram with the numbers and they are close to what I would consider an exponential distribution with such parameter (you can see the plot).

Given that GPT 3.5 does not have access to a Python interpreter, how on earth is it able to do so? I have also tried other distributions and parameters and it kind of works. It's not perfect, but with normal distributions it is usually close to what scipy.stats would generate.

I could understand that it can have learnt to interpret Python code to some extent, but honestly I can't find explanation for random sampling from a probability distribution. For a Normal distribution, I can tell it about the desired mean and variance, and it samples values that are more than reasonable (and close to the true mean/variance specified).

Any thoughts? I honestly am unable to wrap my head around how a LLM can have the understanding on how to sample tokens (at digit level) to fit any probability distribution. To me it seems very unlikely to have similar data either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages."

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**Juergen Schmidhuber, Renowned 'Father Of Modern AI,' Says His Life’s Work Won't Lead To Dystopia**

*May 23, 2023. Contributed by [Hessie Jones](https://twitter.com/hessiejones).*

Amid the growing concern about the impact of more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on society, there are many in the technology community who fear the implications of the advancements in Generative AI if they go unchecked. Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber, a renowned scientist, artificial intelligence researcher and widely regarded as one of the pioneers in the field, is more optimistic. He declares that many of those who suddenly warn against the dangers of AI are just seeking publicity, exploiting the media’s obsession with killer robots which has attracted more attention than “good AI” for healthcare etc.

The potential to revolutionize various industries and improve our lives is clear, as are the equal dangers if bad actors leverage the technology for personal gain. Are we headed towards a dystopian future, or is there reason to be optimistic? I had a chance to sit down with Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber to understand his perspective on this seemingly fast-moving AI-train that will leap us into the future.

As a teenager in the 1970s, Juergen Schmidhuber became fascinated with the idea of creating intelligent machines that could learn and improve on their own, becoming smarter than himself within his lifetime. This would ultimately lead to his groundbreaking work in the field of deep learning.

In the 1980s, he studied computer science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he earned his diploma in 1987. His thesis was on the ultimate self-improving machines that, not only, learn through some pre-wired human-designed learning algorithm, but also learn and improve the learning algorithm itself. Decades later, this became a hot topic. He also received his Ph.D. at TUM in 1991 for work that laid some of the foundations of modern AI.

Schmidhuber is best known for his contributions to the development of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the most powerful type of artificial neural network that can process sequential data such as speech and natural language. With his students Sepp Hochreiter, Felix Gers, Alex Graves, Daan Wierstra, and others, he published architectures and training algorithms for the long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of RNN that is widely used in natural language processing, speech recognition, video games, robotics, and other applications. LSTM has become the most cited neural network of the 20th century, and Business Week called it ""[arguably the most commercial AI achievement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-15/google-amazon-and-facebook-owe-j-rgen-schmidhuber-a-fortune?leadSource=uverify%20wall).""

Throughout his career, Schmidhuber has received various awards and accolades for his groundbreaking work. In 2013, he was awarded the Helmholtz Prize, which recognizes significant contributions to the field of machine learning. In 2016, he was awarded the IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award for ""*pioneering contributions to deep learning and neural networks."" The media have often called him the “father of modern AI,*” because the [most cited neural networks](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/most-cited-neural-nets.html) all build on his lab’s work. He is quick to point out, however, that AI history [goes back centuries.](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html)

Despite his many accomplishments, at the age of 60, he feels mounting time pressure towards building an Artificial General Intelligence within his lifetime and remains committed to pushing the boundaries of AI research and development. He is currently director of the KAUST AI Initiative, scientific director of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, and co-founder and chief scientist of AI company NNAISENSE, whose motto is ""AI∀"" which is a math-inspired way of saying ""AI For All."" He continues to work on cutting-edge AI technologies and applications to improve human health and extend human lives and make lives easier for everyone.

*The following interview has been edited for clarity.*

**Jones: Thank you Juergen for joining me. You have signed letters warning about AI weapons. But you didn't sign the recent publication, ""Pause Gigantic AI Experiments: An Open Letter""? Is there a reason?**

**Schmidhuber:** Thank you Hessie. Glad to speak with you. I have realized that many of those who warn in public against the dangers of AI are just seeking publicity. I don't think the latest letter will have any significant impact because many AI researchers, companies, and governments will ignore it completely.

The proposal frequently uses the word ""we"" and refers to ""us,"" the humans. But as I have pointed out many times in the past, there is no ""we"" that everyone can identify with. Ask 10 different people, and you will hear 10 different opinions about what is ""good."" Some of those opinions will be completely incompatible with each other. Don't forget the enormous amount of conflict between the many people.

The letter also says, ""*If such a pause cannot be quickly put in place, governments should intervene and impose a moratorium.*"" The problem is that different governments have ALSO different opinions about what is good for them and for others. Great Power A will say, if we don't do it, Great Power B will, perhaps secretly, and gain an advantage over us. The same is true for Great Powers C and D.

**Jones: Everyone acknowledges this fear surrounding current generative AI technology. Moreover, the existential threat of this technology has been publicly acknowledged by** [**Sam Altman**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65616866)**, CEO of OpenAI himself, calling for AI regulation. From your perspective, is there an existential threat?**

**Schmidhuber:** It is true that AI can be weaponized, and I have no doubt that there will be all kinds of AI arms races, but AI does not introduce a new quality of existential threat. The threat coming from AI weapons seems to pale in comparison to the much older threat from nuclear hydrogen bombs that don’t need AI at all. We should be much more afraid of half-century-old tech in the form of H-bomb rockets. The Tsar Bomba of 1961 had almost 15 times more destructive power than all weapons of WW-II combined.  Despite the dramatic nuclear disarmament since the 1980s, there are still more than enough nuclear warheads to wipe out human civilization within two hours, without any AI I’m much more worried about that old existential threat than the rather harmless AI weapons.

**Jones: I realize that while you compare AI to the threat of nuclear bombs, there is a current danger that a current technology can be put in the hands of humans and enable them to “eventually” exact further harms to individuals of group in a very precise way, like targeted drone attacks. You are giving people a toolset that they've never had before, enabling bad actors, as some have pointed out, to be able to do a lot more than previously because they didn't have this technology.**

**Schmidhuber:** Now, all that sounds horrible in principle, but our existing laws are sufficient to deal with these new types of weapons enabled by AI. If you kill someone with a gun, you will go to jail. Same if you kill someone with one of these drones. Law enforcement will get better at understanding new threats and new weapons and will respond with better technology to combat these threats. Enabling drones to target persons from a distance in a way that requires some tracking and some intelligence to perform, which has traditionally been performed by skilled humans, to me, it seems is just an improved version of a traditional weapon, like a gun, which is, you know, a little bit smarter than the old guns.

But, in principle, all of that is not a new development. For many centuries, we have had the evolution of better weaponry and deadlier poisons and so on, and law enforcement has evolved their policies to react to these threats over time. So, it's not that we suddenly have a new quality of existential threat and it's much more worrisome than what we have had for about six decades. A large nuclear warhead doesn’t need fancy face recognition to kill an individual. No, it simply wipes out an entire city with ten million inhabitants.

**Jones: The existential threat that’s implied is the extent to which humans have control over this technology. We see some early cases of opportunism which, as you say, tends to get more media attention than positive breakthroughs. But you’re implying that this will all balance out?**

**Schmidhuber:** Historically, we have a long tradition of technological breakthroughs that led to advancements in weapons for the purpose of defense but also for protection. From sticks, to rocks, to axes to gunpowder to cannons to rockets… and now to drones… this has had a drastic influence on human history but what has been consistent throughout history is that those who are using technology to achieve their own ends are themselves, facing the same technology because the opposing side is learning to use it against them. And that's what has been repeated in thousands of years of human history and it will continue. I don't see the new AI arms race as something that is remotely as existential a threat as the good old nuclear warheads.

You said something important, in that some people prefer to talk about the downsides rather than the benefits of this technology, but that's misleading, because 95% of all AI research and AI development is about making people happier and advancing human life and health.

**Jones: Let’s touch on some of those beneficial advances in AI research that have been able to radically change present day methods and achieve breakthroughs.**

**Schmidhuber:** All right! For example, eleven years ago, our team with my postdoc Dan Ciresan was the first to win a [medical imaging competition through deep learning](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/first-time-deep-learning-won-medical-imaging-contest-september-2012.html). We analyzed female breast cells with the objective to determine harmless cells vs. those in the pre-cancer stage. Typically, a trained oncologist needs a long time to make these determinations. Our team, who knew nothing about cancer, were able to train an artificial neural network, which was totally dumb in the beginning, on lots of this kind of data. It was able to outperform all the other methods. Today, this is being used not only for breast cancer, but also for radiology and detecting plaque in arteries, and many other things.  Some of the neural networks that we have developed in the last 3 decades are now prevalent across thousands of healthcare applications, detecting Diabetes and Covid-19 and what not. This will eventually permeate across all healthcare. The good consequences of this type of AI are much more important than the click-bait new ways of conducting crimes with AI.

**Jones: Adoption is a product of reinforced outcomes. The massive scale of adoption either leads us to believe that people have been led astray, or conversely, technology is having a positive effect on people’s lives.**

**Schmidhuber:** The latter is the likely case. There's intense commercial pressure towards good AI rather than bad AI because companies want to sell you something, and you are going to buy only stuff you think is going to be good for you. So already just through this simple, commercial pressure, you have a tremendous bias towards good AI rather than bad AI. However, doomsday scenarios like in Schwarzenegger movies grab more attention than documentaries on AI that improve people’s lives.

**Jones: I would argue that people are drawn to good stories – narratives that contain an adversary and struggle, but in the end, have happy endings. And this is consistent with your comment on human nature and how history, despite its tendency for violence and destruction of humanity, somehow tends to correct itself.**

**Let’s take the example of a technology, which you are aware – GANs – General Adversarial Networks, which today has been used in applications for fake news and disinformation. In actuality, the purpose in the invention of GANs was far from what it is used for today.**

**Schmidhuber:** Yes, the name GANs was created in 2014 but we had the basic principle already in the early 1990s. More than 30 years ago, I called it *artificial curiosity*. It's a very simple way of injecting creativity into a little two network system. This creative AI is not just trying to slavishly imitate humans. Rather, it’s inventing its own goals. Let me explain:

You have two networks. One network is producing outputs that could be anything, any action. Then the second network is looking at these actions and it’s trying to predict the consequences of these actions. An action could move a robot, then something happens, and the other network is just trying to predict what will happen.

Now we can implement artificial curiosity by reducing the prediction error of the second network, which, at the same time, is the reward of the first network. The first network wants to maximize its reward and so it will invent actions that will lead to situations that will surprise the second network, which it has not yet learned to predict well.

In the case where the outputs are fake images, the first network will try to generate images that are good enough to fool the second network, which will attempt to predict the reaction of the environment: fake or real image, and it will try to become better at it. The first network will continue to also improve at generating images whose type the second network will not be able to predict. So, they fight each other. The 2nd network will continue to reduce its prediction error, while the 1st network will attempt to maximize it.

Through this zero-sum game the first network gets better and better at producing these convincing fake outputs which look almost realistic. So, once you have an interesting set of images by Vincent Van Gogh, you can generate new images that leverage his style, without the original artist having ever produced the artwork himself.

**Jones: I see how the Van Gogh example can be applied in an education setting and there are countless examples of artists mimicking styles from famous painters but image generation from this instance that can happen within seconds is quite another feat. And you know this is how GANs has been used. What’s more prevalent today is a socialized enablement of generating images or information to intentionally fool people. It also surfaces new harms that deal with the threat to intellectual property and copyright, where laws have yet to account for. And from your perspective this was not the intention when the model was conceived. What was your motivation in your early conception of what is now GANs?**

**Schmidhuber:** My old motivation for GANs was actually very important and it was not to create deepfakes or fake news but to enable AIs to be curious and invent their own goals, to make them explore their environment and make them creative.

Suppose you have a robot that executes one action, then something happens, then it executes another action, and so on, because it wants to achieve certain goals in the environment. For example, when the battery is low, this will trigger “pain” through hunger sensors, so it wants to go to the charging station, without running into obstacles, which will trigger other pain sensors. It will seek to minimize pain (encoded through numbers). Now the robot has a friend, the second network, which is a world model ––it’s a prediction machine that learns to predict the consequences of the robot’s actions.

Once the robot has a good model of the world, it can use it for planning. It can be used as a simulation of the real world. And then it can determine what is a good action sequence. If the robot imagines this sequence of actions, the model will predict a lot of pain, which it wants to avoid. If it plays this alternative action sequence in its mental model of the world, then it will predict a rewarding situation where it’s going to sit on the charging station and its battery is going to load again. So, it'll prefer to execute the latter action sequence.

In the beginning, however, the model of the world knows nothing, so how can we motivate the first network to generate experiments that lead to data that helps the world model learn something it didn’t already know? That’s what artificial curiosity is about. The dueling two network systems effectively explore uncharted environments by creating experiments so that over time the curious AI gets a better sense of how the environment works. This can be applied to all kinds of environments, and has medical applications.

**Jones: Let’s talk about the future. You have said, “*****Traditional humans won’t play a significant role in spreading intelligence across the universe.*****”**

**Schmidhuber:** Let’s first conceptually separate two types of AIs. The first type of AI are tools directed by humans. They are trained to do specific things like accurately detect diabetes or heart disease and prevent attacks before they happen. In these cases, the goal is coming from the human. More interesting AIs are setting their own goals. They are inventing their own experiments and learning from them. Their horizons expand and eventually they become more and more general problem solvers in the real world. They are not controlled by their parents, but much of what they learn is through self-invented experiments.

A robot, for example, is rotating a toy, and as it is doing this, the video coming in through the camera eyes, changes over time and it begins to learn how this video changes and learns how the 3D nature of the toy generates certain videos if you rotate it a certain way, and eventually, how gravity works, and how the physics of the world works. Like a little scientist!

And I have predicted for decades that future scaled-up versions of such AI scientists will want to further expand their horizons, and eventually go where most of the physical resources are, to build more and bigger AIs. And of course, almost all of these resources are far away from earth out there in space, which is hostile to humans but friendly to appropriately designed AI-controlled robots and self-replicating robot factories. So here we are not talking any longer about our tiny biosphere; no, we are talking about the much bigger rest of the universe.  Within a few tens of billions of years, curious self-improving [AIs will colonize the visible cosmos](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/falling-walls-the-past-present-and-future-of-artificial-intelligence/) in a way that’s infeasible for humans. Those who don’t won’t have an impact. Sounds like science fiction, but since the 1970s I have been unable to see a plausible alternative to this scenario, except for a global catastrophe such as an all-out nuclear war that stops this development before it takes off.

**Jones: How long have these AIs, which can set their own goals — how long have they existed? To what extent can they be independent of human interaction?**

**Schmidhuber:** Neural networks like that have existed for over 30 years. My first simple adversarial neural network system of this kind is the one from 1990 described above. You don’t need a teacher there; it's just a little agent running around in the world and trying to invent new experiments that surprise its own prediction machine.

Once it has figured out certain parts of the world, the agent will become bored and will move on to more exciting experiments. The simple 1990 systems I mentioned have certain limitations, but in the past three decades, we have also built more [sophisticated systems that are setting their own goals](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/artificial-curiosity-since-1990.html) and such systems I think will be essential for achieving true intelligence. If you are only imitating humans, you will never go beyond them. So, you really must give AIs the freedom to explore previously unexplored regions of the world in a way that no human is really predefining.

**Jones: Where is this being done today?**

**Schmidhuber:** Variants of neural network-based artificial curiosity are used today for agents that learn to play video games in a human-competitive way. We have also started to use them for automatic design of experiments in fields such as materials science. I bet many other fields will be affected by it: chemistry, biology, drug design, you name it. However, at least for now, these artificial scientists, as I like to call them, cannot yet compete with human scientists.

I don’t think it’s going to stay this way but, at the moment, it’s still the case.  Sure, AI has made a lot of progress. Since 1997, there have been superhuman chess players, and since 2011, through the DanNet of my team, there have been [superhuman visual pattern recognizers](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/DanNet-triggers-deep-CNN-revolution-2011.html). But there are other things where humans, at the moment at least, are much better, in particular, science itself.  In the lab we have many first examples of self-directed artificial scientists, but they are not yet convincing enough to appear on the radar screen of the public space, which is currently much more fascinated with simpler systems that just imitate humans and write texts based on previously seen human-written documents.

**Jones: You speak of these numerous instances dating back 30 years of these lab experiments where these self-driven agents are deciding and learning and moving on once they’ve learned. And I assume that that rate of learning becomes even faster over time. What kind of timeframe are we talking about when this eventually is taken outside of the lab and embedded into society?**

**Schmidhuber:** This could still take months or even years :-) Anyway, in the not-too-distant future, we will probably see artificial scientists who are good at devising experiments that allow them to discover new, previously unknown physical laws.

As always, we are going to profit from the old trend that has held at least since 1941: every decade compute is getting 100 times cheaper.

**Jones: How does this trend affect modern AI such as ChatGPT?**

**Schmidhuber:** Perhaps you know that all the recent famous AI applications such as ChatGPT and similar models are largely based on principles of artificial neural networks invented in the previous millennium. The main reason why they works so well now is the incredible acceleration of compute per dollar.

ChatGPT is driven by a neural network called “Transformer” described in 2017 by Google. I am happy about that because a quarter century earlier in 1991 I had a particular Transformer variant which is now called the “[Transformer with linearized self-attention](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI/status/1576966129993797632?cxt=HHwWgMDSkeKVweIrAAAA)”. Back then, not much could be done with it, because the compute cost was a million times higher than today. But today, one can train such models on half the internet and achieve much more interesting results.

**Jones: And for how long will this acceleration continue?**

**Schmidhuber:** There's no reason to believe that in the next 30 years, we won't have another factor of 1 million and that's going to be really significant. In the near future, for the first time we will have many not-so expensive devices that can compute as much as a human brain. The physical limits of computation, however, are much further out so even if the trend of a factor of 100 every decade continues, the physical limits (of 1051 elementary instructions per second and kilogram of matter) won’t be hit until, say, the mid-next century. Even in our current century, however, we’ll probably have many machines that compute more than all 10 billion human brains collectively and you can imagine, everything will change then!

**Jones: That is the big question. Is everything going to change? If so, what do you say to the next generation of leaders, currently coming out of college and university. So much of this change is already impacting how they study, how they will work, or how the future of work and livelihood is defined. What is their purpose and how do we change our systems so they will adapt to this new version of intelligence?**

**Schmidhuber:** For decades, people have asked me questions like that, because you know what I'm saying now, I have basically said since the 1970s, it’s just that today, people are paying more attention because, back then, they thought this was science fiction.

They didn't think that I would ever come close to achieving my crazy life goal of building a machine that learns to become smarter than myself such that I can retire. But now many have changed their minds and think it's conceivable. And now I have two daughters, 23 and 25. People ask me: what do I tell them? They know that Daddy always said, “*It seems likely that within your lifetimes, you will have new types of intelligence that are probably going to be superior in many ways, and probably all kinds of interesting ways.*” How should they prepare for that? And I kept telling them the obvious: **Learn how to learn new things**! It's not like in the previous millennium where within 20 years someone learned to be a useful member of society, and then took a job for 40 years and performed in this job until she received her pension. Now things are changing much faster and we must learn continuously just to keep up. I also told my girls that no matter how smart AIs are going to get, learn at least the basics of math and physics, because that’s the essence of our universe, and anybody who understands this will have an advantage, and learn all kinds of new things more easily. I also told them that social skills will remain important, because most future jobs for humans will continue to involve interactions with other humans, but I couldn’t teach them anything about that; they know much more about social skills than I do.

You touched on the big philosophical question about people’s purpose. Can this be answered without answering the even grander question: What’s the purpose of the entire universe?

We don’t know. But what’s happening right now might be connected to the unknown answer. Don’t think of humans as the crown of creation. Instead view human civilization as part of a much grander scheme, an important step (but not the last one) on the path of the universe from very simple initial conditions towards more and more unfathomable complexity. Now it seems ready to take its [next step, a step comparable to the invention of life itself over 3.5 billion years ago](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html#future).  Alas, don’t worry, in the end, all will be good!

**Jones: Let’s get back to this transformation happening right now with OpenAI. There are many questioning the efficacy and accuracy of ChatGPT, and are concerned its release has been premature. In light of the rampant adoption, educators have banned its use over concerns of plagiarism and how it stifles individual development. Should large language models like ChatGPT be used in school?**

**Schmidhuber:** When the calculator was first introduced, instructors forbade students from using it in school. Today, the consensus is that kids should learn the basic methods of arithmetic, but they should also learn to use the “artificial multipliers” aka calculators, even in exams, because laziness and efficiency is a hallmark of intelligence. Any intelligent being wants to minimize its efforts to achieve things.

And that's the reason why we have tools, and why our kids are learning to use these tools. The first stone tools were invented maybe 3.5 million years ago; tools just have become more sophisticated over time. In fact, humans have changed in response to the properties of their tools. Our anatomical evolution was shaped by tools such as spears and fire. So, it's going to continue this way. And there is no permanent way of preventing large language models from being used in school.

**Jones: And when our children, your children graduate, what does their future work look like?**

**Schmidhuber:** A single human trying to predict details of how 10 billion people and their machines will evolve in the future is like a single neuron in my brain trying to predict what the entire brain and its tens of billions of neurons will do next year. 40 years ago, before the WWW was created at CERN in Switzerland, who would have predicted all those young people making money as YouTube video bloggers?

Nevertheless, let’s make a few limited job-related observations. For a long time, people have thought that desktop jobs may require more intelligence than skills trade or handicraft professions. But now, it turns out that it's much easier to replace certain aspects of desktop jobs than replacing a carpenter, for example. Because everything that works well in AI is happening behind the screen currently, but not so much in the physical world.

There are now artificial systems that can read lots of documents and then make really nice summaries of these documents. That is a desktop job. Or you give them a description of an illustration that you want to have for your article and pretty good illustrations are being generated that may need some minimal fine-tuning. But you know, all these desktop jobs are much easier to facilitate than the real tough jobs in the physical world. And it's interesting that the things people thought required intelligence, like playing chess, or writing or summarizing documents, are much easier for machines than they thought. But for things like playing football or soccer, there is no physical robot that can remotely compete with the abilities of a little boy with these skills. So, AI in the physical world, interestingly, is much harder than AI behind the screen in virtual worlds. And it's really exciting, in my opinion, to see that jobs such as plumbers are much more challenging than playing chess or writing another tabloid story.

**Jones: The way data has been collected in these large language models does not guarantee personal information has not been excluded. Current consent laws already are outdated when it comes to these large language models (LLM). The concern, rightly so, is increasing surveillance and loss of privacy. What is your view on this?**

**Schmidhuber:** As I have indicated earlier: are surveillance and loss of privacy inevitable consequences of increasingly complex societies? Super-organisms such as cities and states and companies consist of numerous people, just like people consist of numerous cells. These cells enjoy little privacy. They are constantly monitored by specialized ""police cells"" and ""border guard cells"": Are you a cancer cell? Are you an external intruder, a pathogen? Individual cells sacrifice their freedom for the benefits of being part of a multicellular organism.

Similarly, for super-organisms such as nations. Over 5000 years ago, writing enabled recorded history and thus became its inaugural and most important invention. Its initial purpose, however, was to facilitate surveillance, to track citizens and their tax payments. The more complex a super-organism, the more comprehensive its collection of information about its constituents.

200 years ago, at least, the parish priest in each village knew everything about all the village people, even about those who did not confess, because they appeared in the confessions of others. Also, everyone soon knew about the stranger who had entered the village, because some occasionally peered out of the window, and what they saw got around. Such control mechanisms were temporarily lost through anonymization in rapidly growing cities but are now returning with the help of new surveillance devices such as smartphones as part of digital nervous systems that tell companies and governments a lot about billions of users. Cameras and drones etc. are becoming increasingly tinier and more ubiquitous. More effective recognition of faces and other detection technology are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and many will use it to identify others anywhere on earth; the big wide world will not offer any more privacy than the local village. Is this good or bad? Some nations may find it easier than others to justify more complex kinds of super-organisms at the expense of the privacy rights of their constituents.

**Jones: So, there is no way to stop or change this process of collection, or how it continuously informs decisions over time? How do you see governance and rules responding to this, especially amid** [**Italy’s ban on ChatGPT following**](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/italy-has-banned-chatgpt-heres-what-other-countries-are-doing.html) **suspected user data breach and the more recent news about the** [**Meta’s record $1.3billion fine**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-given-record-13-bln-fine-given-5-months-stop-eu-us-data-flows-2023-05-22/) **in the company’s handling of user information?**

**Schmidhuber:** Data collection has benefits and drawbacks, such as the loss of privacy. How to balance those? I have argued for addressing this through data ownership in data markets. If it is true that data is the new oil, then it should have a price, just like oil. At the moment, the major surveillance platforms such as Meta do not offer users any money for their data and the transitive loss of privacy. In the future, however, we will likely see attempts at creating efficient data markets to figure out the data's true financial value through the interplay between supply and demand.

Even some of the sensitive medical data should not be priced by governmental regulators but by patients (and healthy persons) who own it and who may sell or license parts thereof as micro-entrepreneurs in a healthcare data market.

Following a previous [interview](https://www.swissre.com/institute/conferences/The-intelligence-behind-artificial-intelligence.html), I gave for one of the largest re-insurance companies , let's look at the different participants in such a data market: patients, hospitals, data companies. (1) **Patients** with a rare form of cancer can offer more valuable data than patients with a very common form of cancer. (2) **Hospitals** and their machines are needed to extract the data, e.g., through magnet spin tomography, radiology, evaluations through human doctors, and so on. (3) **Companies** such as Siemens, Google or IBM would like to buy annotated data to make better artificial neural networks that learn to predict pathologies and diseases and the consequences of therapies. Now the market’s invisible hand will decide about the data’s price through the interplay between demand and supply. On the demand side, you will have several companies offering something for the data, maybe through an app on the smartphone (a bit like a stock market app). On the supply side, each patient in this market should be able to profit from high prices for rare valuable types of data. Likewise, competing data extractors such as hospitals will profit from gaining recognition and trust for extracting data well at a reasonable price. The market will make the whole system efficient through incentives for all who are doing a good job. Soon there will be a flourishing ecosystem of commercial data market advisors and what not, just like the ecosystem surrounding the traditional stock market. The value of the data won’t be determined by governments or ethics committees, but by those who own the data and decide by themselves which parts thereof they want to license to others under certain conditions.

At first glance, a market-based system seems to be detrimental to the interest of certain monopolistic companies, as they would have to pay for the data - some would prefer free data and keep their monopoly. However, since every healthy and sick person in the market would suddenly have an incentive to collect and share their data under self-chosen anonymity conditions, there will soon be many more useful data to evaluate all kinds of treatments. On average, people will live longer and healthier, and many companies and the entire healthcare system will benefit.

**Jones: Finally, what is your view on open source versus the private companies like Google and OpenAI? Is there a danger to supporting these private companies’ large language models versus trying to keep these models open source and transparent, very much like what LAION is doing?**

**Schmidhuber:** I signed this [open letter by LAION](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2023/04/19/amid-growing-call-to-pause-ai-research-laion-petitions-governments-to-keep-agi-research-open-active-and-responsible/?sh=6973c08b62e3) because I strongly favor the open-source movement. And I think it's also something that is going to challenge whatever big tech dominance there might be at the moment. Sure, the best models today are run by big companies with huge budgets for computers, but the exciting fact is that open-source models are not so far behind, some people say maybe six to eight months only. Of course, the private company models are all based on stuff that was created in academia, often in little labs without so much funding, which publish without patenting their results and open source their code and others take it and improved it.

Big tech has profited tremendously from academia; their main achievement being that they have scaled up everything greatly, sometimes even failing to credit the original inventors.

So, it's very interesting to see that as soon as some big company comes up with a new scaled-up model, lots of students out there are competing, or collaborating, with each other, trying to come up with equal or better performance on smaller networks and smaller machines. And since they are open sourcing, the next guy can have another great idea to improve it, so now there’s tremendous competition also for the big companies.

Because of that, and since AI is still getting exponentially cheaper all the time, I don't believe that big tech companies will dominate in the long run. They find it very hard to compete with the enormous open-source movement. As long as you can encourage the open-source community, I think you shouldn't worry too much. Now, of course, you might say if everything is open source, then the bad actors also will more easily have access to these AI tools. And there's truth to that. But as always since the invention of controlled fire, it was good that knowledge about how technology works quickly became public such that everybody could use it. And then, against any bad actor, there's almost immediately a counter actor trying to nullify his efforts. You see, I still believe in our old motto ""AI∀"" or ""AI For All.""

**Jones: Thank you, Juergen for sharing your perspective on this amazing time in history. It’s clear that with new technology, the enormous potential can be matched by disparate and troubling risks which we’ve yet to solve, and even those we have yet to identify. If we are to dispel the fear of a sentient system for which we have no control, humans, alone need to take steps for more responsible development and collaboration to ensure AI technology is used to ultimately benefit society. Humanity will be judged by what we do next.**"

From my personal experience, the quality of the model depends a lot on the fine-tuning data as opposed to just the sheer size.

The future of LLMs might look more open-source than imagined 3 months back?

Would love to hear everyone's opinions on how they see the future of LLMs evolving? Will it be few players (OpenAI) cracking the AGI and conquering the whole world or a lot of smaller open-source models which ML engineers fine-tune for their use-cases?

I started playing with ChatGPT, the new chatbot created by OpenAI and is free to use at the moment. 

I asked it to describe a scene between Batman and Joker on a subway platform and the result is mind blowing! I let you have a read of the story yourself:

Generated by ChatGPT:

The scene is set in a dimly lit subway station, with the Joker standing on the platform, gazing up at Batman who is perched on a nearby overhead beam. The Joker is dressed in his signature purple suit and green hair, a wicked grin plastered across his face.

In his hand, he holds a deck of playing cards, flipping them expertly through his fingers. The sound of the cards shuffling echoes through the empty station.

Batman, dressed in his dark suit and cape, stares down at the Joker with a steely gaze. His muscles are tense, ready for any sudden movements from the villain.

The Joker cackles, his laughter bouncing off the walls of the station. ""Hello, Batsy! Long time no see. How's the crime-fighting business these days?""

Batman remains silent, watching the Joker carefully.

The Joker's grin widens. ""Come on, Bats. Don't be so serious all the time. Let's have some fun."" He tosses a card at Batman, who easily catches it.

""I'm not here to play games, Joker,"" Batman says in a grave tone.

The Joker's laughter turns into a maniacal cackle. ""But that's the whole point, Batsy! Life is a game. And I'm the master of it.""

He pulls out a bomb from his pocket and holds it up, the timer ticking down. ""Let's see how well you can play, shall we?""

Batman leaps down from the beam, landing gracefully on the platform. He advances towards the Joker, who backs away, still holding the bomb.

The tension in the air is palpable as the two foes face off, each ready to outsmart the other. The sound of the bomb's timer counts down, adding to the tension of the scene.

The Joker's grin never fades, even as Batman inches closer. ""It's always a pleasure to play with you, Batsy. But I think it's time for me to make my exit.""

With a flourish, the Joker disappears in a cloud of smoke, leaving Batman standing alone on the platform. The bomb detonates, causing a small explosion and sending debris flying.

But Batman remains unharmed, ready to continue the never-ending battle against the Joker and all the evil that plagues the city.

End of the story.

I used the first two paragraphs in OpenAI’s Dall E 2 to generate an image and [this](https://labs.openai.com/s/p8L8Z6c3S7qZ26U7owfbx7lS) is the result I got.

Please keep in mind that this is the very beginning of this tool and think about the endless possibilities it can create."

Or was there never one? To be specific, would knowing simple scikit-learn algorithms, or basics of decision trees/SVM qualify you for full-fledged roles only in the past or does it still today? At what point did FAANGs boldly state: preferred (required) to have publications at top-tier venues (ICLR, ICML, CVPR, NIPS, etc) in their job postings?

I use the word 'creep' in the same context 'power creep' is used in battle animes where the scale of power slowly gets to such an irrationally large scale that anything in the past looks extremely weak.

Back in late 2016 I landed my first ML role at a defense firm (lol) but to be fair had just watched a couple ML courses on YouTube, took maybe 2 ML grad courses, and had an incomplete working knowledge of CNNs. Never used Tensorflow, had some experience with Theano not sure if it's exists anymore. 

I'm certain that skill set would be insufficient in the 2023 ML industry. But it begs the question is this skill creep making the job market impenetrable for folks who were already working post 2012-2014. 

Neural architectures are becoming increasingly complex. You want to develop a multi-modal architecture for an embodied agent? Well you better know a good mix of DL involving RL+CV+NLP. Improving latency on edge devices - how well do you know your ONNX/TensorRT/CUDA kernels, your classes likely didn't even teach you those. Masters is the new bachelors degree, and that's just to give you a fighting chance. 

Yeah not sure if it was after the release of AlexNet in 2012, Tensorflow in 2015, Attention /Transformers in 2017 or now ChatGPT - but the skill creep is definitely creating an increasingly fast and growing technical rigor in the field. Close your eyes for 2 years and your models feel prehistoric and your CUDA, Pytorch, Nvidia Driver, NumPy  versions need a fat upgrade.

Mostly on the research side which immediately puts him very *hostile* against engineers. But I guess it is understandable given the fact that he works on Meta and Meta has faced a lot of backlash (for good and bad reasons), most especially with Galactica where their first rollout got so bad they had to close it immediately. It's also particularly funny given his political leaning that he is very spiteful of a company that uses *open-source knowledge* and builds on top of it.

Lately, his social media and statements are barrages against ChatGPT and LLM's. Sure, he may have a point here and there but his statements look very petty. Here are some examples

*""By releasing public demos that, as impressive & useful as they may be, have major flaws, established companies have less to gain & more to lose than cash-hungry startups.  If Google & Meta haven't released chatGPT-like things,* ***it's not because they can't****. It's because they won't.""*

*>* Except that anyone in the IT industry knows that big tech companies **cant release** something very fast because of politicking and bureaucracy in the system. It takes years to release something into public in big tech compared to startups.

*""Data on the intellectual contribution to AI from various research organizations. Some of organizations publish knowledge and open-source code for the entire world to use.* ***Others just consume it.""***

***>*** Then adds a graph where the big tech is obviously at the top of the race for most number of AI-related research papers (*without normalizing it to the number of researchers per org*)

*""It's nothing revolutionary, although that's the way it's perceived in the public,"" the computer scientist said. ""It's just that, you know, it's well put together, it's nicely done.""*

\> Except that it is indeed revolutionary in terms of the ***applied research*** framework -- *adding on top of open-source, state-of-the-art research and quickly putting it into production for people to use.*

*""my point is that even* ***the engineering work isn't particularly difficult.*** *I bet that there will be half a dozen similar similar systems within 6 months. If that happens, it's because the underlying science has been around for a while, and the engineering is pretty straightforward.""*

""*I'm trying to correct a \*perception\* by the public & the media who see chatGPT as this incredibly new, innovative, & unique technological breakthrough that is far ahead of everyone else.*  ***It's just not.""***

""*One can regurgitate Python code without any understanding of reality.""*

""*No one is saying LLMs are not useful. I have forcefully said so myself, following the short-lived release of FAIR's* ***Galactica****. People crucified it because it could generate nonsense.* ***ChatGPT*** *does the same thing. But again, that doesn't mean they are not useful.""*

He also seems to undermine the rapid engineering work and MLOps that come with ChatGPT which is funny because Meta hasn't released any substantial product from their research that has seen the light of the day for a week. Also, GPT3 to ChatGPT in itself in a research perspective is a jump. Maybe not as incremental as what Lecun does every paper, but compared to an average paper in the field, it is.

To say that LLMs are not *intelligent* and it just *regurgitates Python code* probably haven't used CoPilot, for example. 

It's a classic case of a researcher-engineer beef. And that a startup can profit from derivatives of research that big tech has published. OpenAI broke their perspective on the profit from research. Big tech tried to produce revolutionary research papers on a surplus but never puts them into production thinking that they are the only companies that could if they want to. Then once one company created a derivative of a large research work and profited from it, it baffled them. Although people could argue that Stable Diffusion did this first in the Generative Image Space.

It's one thing to correct misconceptions in the public. It's also one thing not to be petty about the overnight success of a product and an immediate rise of a company that got embraced warmly by tech and non-tech people. It's petty to gatekeep. At the end of the day, ML is not just about research, it's **applied research**. It's useless until it reaches the end of the tunnel. 99% of research papers out there are just tiny updates over the state of the art which has been a pointless race for about  a year or two, with no reproducible code or published data. 

Inventing combustion engine is just as important as putting it in the car."

Halfway through, I felt the sudden acceleration of NLP, where there was so much everywhere all at once. Before, knowing one's domain, and the state-of-the-art GCN, CNN or Bert architectures, was enough. 

Since, I've been working in a semi-related area (computer assisted humanities) as a data engineer/software developer/ML engineer (it's a small team so many hats). Not much in terms of latest news, so I tried recently to get up to speed with the recent developments.

But there are so many ! Everywhere. Even just in NLP, not considering all the other fields such as reinforcement learning, computer vision, all the fundamentals of ML etc. It is damn near impossible to gather an in-depth understanding of a model as they are so complex, and numerous. All of them are built on top of other ones, so you also need to read up on those to understand anything. I follow some people on LinkedIn who just give new names every week or so. Going to look for papers in top conferences is also daunting as there is no guarantee that a paper with an award will translate to an actual system, while companies churn out new architectures without the research paper/methodology being made public. It's overwhelming. 

So I guess my question is two fold : how does one get up to speed after a year of not being too much in the field ? And how does one keep up after that ?"

**Update:** Thanks everyone for the comments, my conclusion here is that DDPM paper has an error in it, namely, the above image. 

The error is because they show the outer expectation not being used up, where indeed it IS being used up. 

I found a correct write-up of the derivation here in Calvin's paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11970.pdf). And here is the image:

To block that token from an LLM is to make it unable to explain a pretty significant step in the history of modern LLMs.

**Live demo:** [**https://www.glaciermd.com/search**](https://www.glaciermd.com/search?utm_campaign=reddit_post_1)

**Background**

I've been working for a while on building a better version of WebMD, and I recently started playing around with LLMs, trying to figure out if there was anything useful there.

The problem with the current batch of ""predict-next-token"" LLMs is that they hallucinate—you can ask ChatGPT to answer medical questions, but it'll either

1. Refuse to answer (not great)
2. Give a completely false answer (really super bad)

So I spent some time trying to coax these LLMs to give answers based on a very specific set of inputs (peer-reviewed medical research) to see if I could get more accurate answers. And I did!

The best part is you can actually trace the final answer back to the original sources, which will hopefully instill some confidence in the result.

Here's how it works:

1. User types in a question
2. Pull top \~800 studies from Semantic Scholar and Pubmed
3. Re-rank using `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`
4. Ask `text-davinci-003` to answer the question based on the top 10 studies (if possible)
5. Summarize those answers using `text-davinci-003`

Would love to hear what people think (and if there's a better/cheaper way to do it!).

Of course, for text generation use-cases, this makes the most sense.

However, a lot of practical NLP problems can be formulated as classification/ tagging problems. The Pre-ChatGPT systems used to be pretty involved with a lot of moving components (keyword extraction, super long regex, finding nearest vectors in embedding space, etc.).

So, what's actually happening? Are folks replacing specific components with the LLM APIs; or are entire systems being replaced by a series of calls to the LLM APIs? Are BERT-based solutions still used?

Now that the ChatGPT APIs support longer & longer context windows (128k), other than pricing and data privacy concerns, are there any-use cases in which BERT-based/ other solutions would shine; which doesn't require as much compute as models like ChatGPT/ LaMDA/ similar LLMs ?

If it's proprietary data that the said LLM models have no clue about, ofc then you'd be using your own models. But a lot of use-cases seem to revolve around having a general understanding of human language itself (E.g. complaint/ ticket classification/ deriving insights from product reviews).

Any blogs, paper, case-studies, or other write-ups addressing the same will be appreciated. I'd love to hear all of your experiences as well, in case you've worked on/ heard of the aforementioned migration in real-world systems.

This question is specifically asked, keeping in mind NLP use-cases; but feel free to extend your answer to other modalities as well (E.g. combination of tabular & text data)."

I don't come from a machine learning background. I am just a programmer. So bear with me if they sound a bit dumb.

I was checking about chatGPT a bit the last week. I went through their papers and also tried out a fine tuning by myself by creating some fictional world and giving it some examples. 

The first thing I wondered is what is very special about the model than the large data and parameter set it has, that other competitors can't do. I ask this because I have seen a lot of ""google killer"" discussions in some places. From what I understood from their papers I thought it is something another company with the computing power and the filtered data can have up and running in few months. I see their advantage in rolling out to the public because with feedbacks from actual users all over the world it can potentially be retrained.

The second thing I wondered is its scalability. It feels to me that it is a very big challenge to keep it scalable in the future. Currently getting a long text out of it is kind of painful because it has to continuously generate. I think it is continuously calculating with the huge parameter set it has. I wonder also about new trends, if it needs to be retrained. I also used it for a fine tuning, where I created a fictional world with its own law and rules and the fine tuning took hours in the queue - so is it creating separate parameters for my case? that would be a lot considering how much parameter set they have."

I try to keep a positive vibe through my posts, but that changes today. Today I am going to rant.

I read [Machine Learning is Still Too Hard for Software Engineers](https://www.nyckel.com/blog/machine-learning-difficulties/) by [George Mathew](https://twitter.com/georgemkan), having discovered it at the top of Hacker News. 

Now, where do I start?

The author described how, to do something basic like image classification, you have to:

>Understand concepts like tensors, loss functions, transfer-learning, logistic regression, network fine-tuning, hyper-parameter search, over-fitting, active learning, regularization, and quantization.

This is like telling a software engineer, to set up a database, you have to (special thanks to ChatGPT):

>Understand concepts like indexing, transaction logs, replication, query optimization, database tuning, parameter indexing, redundancy, real-time processing, data normalization, and compression.

No it’s literally a pip install and then this (from [sqlite docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)):

      import sqlite3
      con = sqlite3.connect(""tutorial.db"")
      cur = con.cursor()
      cur.execute(""CREATE TABLE movie(title, year, score)"")

Next the author talks about the need for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which involves a closer look at your data to figure out if work is needed before say feeding it to a model (like maybe you need to scale first so there’s zero mean and standard deviation of one).

Not sure where dude’s been but there’s a million blog posts on using ChatGPT to do EDA (even OpenAI called it Advanced Data Analysis at one point!). It’s also highly curious that data quality issues come under the header ‘Software’.

Finally, infra. Apparently “once you’ve figured out the ML and software bits, you’ll need cloud infrastructure expertise”.

I mean, the docs for AWS SageMaker and AWS Lambda read equally obtuse to me.

There are startups that are trying to make this better. [Modal](https://modal.com/) so you don’t have to read AWS docs. [Modular](https://www.modular.com/) so you can write Python vs CUDA.

Yes, they’re new but come on, man, we’re all trying to make this better. Don’t go off talking about how hard ML is and then go “Want to build your own classifier in just minutes?” (which is behind a login page to boot).

It’s lipstick on a pig. Don’t do this.

I had the privilege of working with [Thomson Nguyen](https://twitter.com/itsthomson) at Square, he had the following analogy. A car is a very complicated machine, but to drive it you only need to know a couple of things: steering wheel, gears, pedals. Same thing for ML.

Now let’s go build.

PyReason is a Python package for logical inference and designed for use with machine learning ([https://github.com/lab-v2/pyreason](https://github.com/lab-v2/pyreason)).

You may think that’s all fine and good, but are wondering why would we need a logic for machine learning? In this post, I’ll discuss why we did it.

First, a lot of the criticism of machine learning, especially deep learning is that while it obtains excellent result son may tasks, it is merely mimicking historical data and not learning actual relationships. This has resulted in a lot of the major shortcomings in ML such as the [hallucinations](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/podcasts/hard-fork-bing-ai-elon.html?action=click&module=audio-series-bar&region=header&pgtype=Article) of large language models, the requirements of vast amounts of training data to learn games, and brittleness in certain applications (e.g., the recent defeat of AlphaGo, difficulty in [solving math problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11f29f9/r_chatgpt_failure_increase_linearly_with_addition/)). In a video lecture, we review some of these shortcomings, much of which constitutes active areas of research ([part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cooDzgd8NA), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2xfgwovwso)).

Then enter “[neuro symbolic](https://neurosymoblic.asu.edu/)” artificial intelligence. Actually an old idea where neural architectures can work hand-in-hand with logic, often even having an equivalence between the two. The idea is symbolic AI has many shortcomings (brittleness to noise, difficulty in learning) that can be address with deep learning while its strengths (modularity, ability to add constraints, symbolic manipulation) can address some of deep learning’s limitations.

Neuro symbolic AI is a highly active area of research, and much of the advancements have identified special logical languages to use in their approach. Our goal with PyReason was to unify many of these logics and provide logic capabilities in a robust and modern Python implementation. We are working on a few joint projects with industry partners applying this to various use-cases, and now we have made the code base and library available as an open source package. In a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1PSl3KQCmo&t=8s), we outline six major capabilities that we felt were important:

1. Open world reasoning – ability to reason in uncertain situations (important for interfacing with ML models)
2. Multi-step inference
3. Explainability
4. Temporal reasoning
5. Graph-based reasoning
6. Designed to support neuro symbolic frameworks

The release of PyReason will kick off not only new research by our group and our collaborators, but also associated software. We’re pretty excited about this new direction!"

**AI Startup Hugging Face Is Raising Fresh VC Funds At $4 Billion Valuation**

Hugging Face is raising a new funding round that is expected to value the high-flying AI startup at $4 billion, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter tell Forbes.

The Series D funding round is expected to raise at least $200 million, two sources said, with Ashton Kutcher’s venture capital firm, Sound Ventures, currently leading an investor scrum. But cofounder and CEO Clément Delangue is shopping around as the company has received multiple offers this week, four sources added.

Delangue was expected to pick a preferred offer as soon as Friday, according to another source, who noted that the situation was still fluid, meaning no agreement has been reached, and the numbers involved could change. Several other sources, who asked to remain anonymous as they weren’t authorized to talk about the deal, said that Hugging Face could seek to raise more, as much as $300 million, while existing investors could still attempt to take the round in a last-minute bid. GV, the venture firm backed by Alphabet, and DFJ were said to be looking at the round, one source added.

Hugging Face didn’t respond to requests for comment. GV declined to comment. Coatue, DFJ, Kutcher, and Lux also didn’t respond.

The anticipated funding is the latest exclamation point in a cash frenzy for promising AI companies, particularly those providing large-language models, or LLMs, that power them. Just over a year ago, Hugging Face raised $100 million in a Series C round led by Lux Capital; Coatue and Sequoia were new investors in that round, joining A.Capital Ventures and Addition. The company had attained a $2 billion valuation in that round despite taking in less than $10 million in revenue in 2021. Its revenue run rate has spiked this year and now sits at around $30 million to $50 million, three sources said — with one noting that it had more that tripled compared to the start of the year.

Named after the emoji of a smiling face with jazz hands, Brooklyn-based Hugging Face has grown quickly by offering what Delangue has described as a “GitHub for machine learning.” It is a central company in a growing movement of AI models that are open sourced, meaning that anyone can access and modify them for free. Hugging Face makes money by charging for security and corporate tools on top of a hub of hundreds of thousands of models trained by its community of developers, including the popular Stable Diffusion model that forms the basis for another controversial AI unicorn, Stability AI. (On Thursday, a Stability AI cofounder sued CEO Emad Mostaque, alleging he was tricked into selling his stake for next to nothing.) Per a Forbes profile in 2022, Bloomberg, Pfizer and Roche were early Hugging Face customers.

Earlier this year, Delangue warned that model providers reliant on paying huge sums to Big Tech’s cloud providers would function as “cloud money laundering.” But training and maintaining models — and building enterprise-grade businesses around them — remains costly. In June, Inflection AI raised $1.3 billion, in part to manage its Microsoft compute and Nvidia hardware costs; the same month, foundation model rival Cohere raised $270 million. Anthropic, maker of the recently-released ChatGPT rival Claude 2, raised $450 million in May. OpenAI closed its own $300 million share sale in April, then raised $175 million for a fund to back other startups a month later, per a filing. Adept became a unicorn after announcing a $350 million fundraise in March. Stability AI, meanwhile, met with a number of venture firms in the spring seeking its own new up-round, industry sources said.

At a $4 billion valuation, Hugging Face would vault to one of the category’s highest-valued companies, matching Inflection AI and just behind Anthropic, reported to have reached closer to $5 billion. OpenAI remains the giant in the fast-growing category, Google, Meta and infrastructure companies like Databricks excluded; while its ownership and valuation structure is complex, the company’s previous financings implied a price tag in the $27 billion to $29 billion range.

Speaking for another Forbes story on the breakout moment for generative AI tools, Delangue predicted, “I think there’s potential for multiple $100 billion companies.”"

Then, the researchers train a reward model on responses ranked by humans. 

When I understand correctly, they let the LLM generate responses that humans have to rank on a scale from 1-5. Then, they train a reward model (I suppose in supervised fashion?) on these ranked outputs. Once that's done, they use reinforcement learning (RL) with proximal policy optimization (PPO) to update the LLM. 

My question is why they use RL with PPO for this last step? Why don't they fine-tune the LLM using regular supervised learning, whereas the human-ranked outputs represent the labels. Since these are labels in the range 1-5, this could be a ranking or ordinal regression loss for supervised learning."

Abstract:

>Solving complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities is a key step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). While there are abundant AI models available for different domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional ability in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks and language could be a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, a system that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., HuggingFace) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in HuggingFace, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in HuggingFace, HuggingGPT is able to cover numerous sophisticated AI tasks in different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which **paves a new way towards AGI.**

Title: Model Dementia: Generated Data Makes Models 

Forget  Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We call this effect model dementia and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet."

Why not just replace $W\_q\^T W\_k$ with a  single matrix $W\_{qv}$, and learn the matrix that is the product of  W\_q\^T W\_k instead of the matrices themselves? How does it help to have  two matrices instead of one? And if it helps, why is that not done when  applying matrices between neuron layers?  


Chatgpt tells me that the reason is that it allows the model to learn a different representation for the query and key. But because they are just dotted together, it seems to me that you can just use the original embedding as the query with no loss of generality.

[UPDATE:
Thanks for all of the interesting points! The answer turns out to be because W_q and W_k can map to a lower dimensional space, like two K by k matrix, where k is smaller than K. The mapping to a lower dimensional space lowers the number of parameters to train.

Ended up calling it [Jackchat](https://www.jackchat.ai/) (had to name it after myself lol). You can use voice to talk to ChatGPT (big voice button), it can talk back to you with voice, it’s connected to the web, it's free, and it doesn’t require an account to use.

This limits their use cases and prohibits more ambitious prompts.

This was recently resolved by researchers at Google Brain in Alberta, Canada. In their recent paper they describe a new method of using associative memory which removes the text limit and they also prove that some large language models are universal Turing machines.

This will pave the way for entire novels being shared with large language models, personal genomes, etc.

The paper talks about the use of ""associative memory"" which is also known as content-addressable memory (CAM). This type of memory allows the system to retrieve data based on its content rather than its location. Unlike traditional memory systems that use specific memory addresses to access data, associative memory uses CAM to find data based on a pattern or keyword.

Presumably, this will open up a new market for associative memory since I would happily pay some extra money for content to be permanently stored in associative memory and to remove the text limit. This will also drive down the price of associative memory if millions of people are willing to pay a monthly fee for storage and the removal of prompt text limits.

The paper does point that there are still problems with conditional statements that confuse the large language models. However, I believe this can be resolved with semantic graphs. This would involve collecting data from various sources and using natural language processing techniques to extract entities and relationships from the text. Once the graph is constructed, it could be integrated into the language model in a variety of ways. One approach is to use the graph as an external memory, similar to the approach taken in the paper. The graph can be encoded as a set of key-value pairs and used to augment the model's attention mechanism during inference. The attention mechanism can then focus on relevant nodes in the graph when generating outputs.

Another potential approach is to incorporate the graph into the model's architecture itself. For example, the graph can be used to inform the initialization of the model's parameters or to guide the attention mechanism during training. This could help the model learn to reason about complex concepts and relationships more effectively, potentially leading to better performance on tasks that require this kind of reasoning.

The use of knowledge graphs can also help ground truth large language models and reduce hallucinations.

(A demo video can be found on the Github)

Hi there!

I'd like to share with you a project I recently developed. My inspiration came from a recent post about [Set-of-Mark visual grounding in GPT-4V](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/17bcikh/r_setofmark_som_unleashes_extraordinary_visual/). Fascinatingly, my tests showed that GPT-4V, equipped with this capability, could inspect a UI screenshot and provide the precise pixel coordinates needed for steering a mouse/keyboard to perform a specified task.

Motivated by this, I built a proof-of-concept web browser embedded with a co-pilot that can ""view"" the browser and interact with it. Currently, the demo is basic, utilizing web-scraping to morph ChatGPT Plus into an unofficial GPT-4V API at the backend. It lacks some actions and an adblock, resulting in the agent potentially being overloaded by the extensive popups and visual disruption common on most websites.

Despite the limited tests conducted so far, the agent has shown the capability to post on Reddit, search for products, and initiate the checkout process. Interestingly, it even detected auto-labeler glitches when trying to play a game and attempted to revert the action. (The sam auto-labeler from the SoM demo would be sufficient to allow this agent to interact with game UI)

I'm a firm believer that scaled-up versions of such agents could significantly improve productivity and accessibility across an array of computer applications.

I'm eager to hear your thoughts, particularly on the trending shift towards general AI agents and assistants, examples being Windows Copilot, Adept ACT-1, AutoGPT, [UI-Act](https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1765v6i/d_p_uibased_ai_agents_uiact/), among others.

Language models (LMs) furnished with abilities, such as function-calling, follow a growing trend. These primarily rely on text-based state representations and APIs for execution. In scenarios where these are impractical, UI-based agents may offer a more universal alternative. Given that the agent's interplay with the computer is the same as that of humans, it's easier to train using expert demonstrations without requiring substantial technical expertise.

Looking forward to hearing your views!

https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00050

This papers is 42 pages long without citations, so I didn't read it all, but I scanned it all and read in depth several sections. I would be interested in whether I missed something here. 

The main argument seems to be that ChatGPT can do ""causal discovery"" better than other algorithmic approaches. If true, this could be really big. Imagine giving a data set and an algorithm gives you even a better-than-chance determination of causal relationships? This could help give really meaningful context to data sets and inform science in a real way.

And this paper also seems to at least recognize the need to control for data contamination by testing whether a data set has been ""memorized"", or is in the training set.

But there's a huge problem. On page 7, we get this

>LLMs offer a fresh perspective on the causal discovery problem by focusing on the metadata associated with variables in a dataset, rather than their data values.

As far as I can tell, this paper is nothing but asking causal questions of the column names in a table. So you have a table with n columns, 2 of which are ""Amount of rain"" and ""Number of car crashes"", and then you ask ChatGPT if the amount of rain causes the number of car crashes or the reverse. (Section 3.1: ""Pairwise causal discovery"") The paper then says that this means ChatGPT is doing ""causal analysis"" on this dataset. Wow!

(Side note: Why spend all the time they do talking about how they tested for data contamination if they aren't even using the data? The better question is whether the names of the data columns are included in descriptive text anywhere in the training set, and that's not something that can be probed using the method they describe.)

Basically, they are offering ""a new frontier for causality"" by just asking if A causes B or the reverse without knowing if sentences saying that A causes B are included in the training data. The performance of the models in this paper seem to be entirely because of data contamination. And this offers nothing over just asking a human to quickly say which is causing which. There's no identification of **new** causal links, for example.

Am I missing anything, or is this just more Microsoft advertising-pretending-to-be-real-research?"

GPT4 is not just predicting syntax and word semantics. It seems to do higher level reasoning about some concepts and tasks. 

Have a look at its attempt to draw a unicorn in LaTeX: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf

The video is worth a watch if you don't want to read 130 page PDF https://youtu.be/qbIk7-JPB2c.  Or ask ChatGPT to summarise it for you 🤣

In particular, the thing that changed my mind about higher level reasoning was it's ability to draw in a tool (latex) it had never seen before. 

And I was bowled over when it was asked to draw the horn on a unicorn, when it was missing the horn. It might seem a fairly small thing, but it figured out from a really abstract/minimalist set of shapes, the antonyms of a unicorn and drew the unicorn on the head of the horse. 🐴🦄. That means it knows what makes a unicorn special and the horn should be on the head, and it can infer the abstract shape and figure out where the head is located.

This inference is way beyond a ""word predictor"" that sceptics are saying about it's ""intelligent"" abilities.

One thing people ignore is that the GPT engine is made up of hundred of layers of attention logic. The lower layers are dealing with words, syntax, parts of speech, word semantics. But as you go higher up the deep neutral network, it is building more and more layers of knowledge about the datasets it was trained on. Somewhere in those layers it's knows about unicorns and about abstract drawing interpretation.

Dig into the architect of LLMs and you'll see that it's a deep neural network and the depth is encoding some real world concepts from it's training data. 

Sure it hallucinates but that's a bug in the system and it's year 5 of Openai and LLMs. I see the weaknesses being trained out in the future."

For a simple NLP example, you start with some embeddings of the sentence, let those word tokens attend to each other, use a FF layer to let the elements of the vector connect to themselves, then repeat (oversimplified transformer) and then have it predict the next token. The intuition usually given is that we are letting the network learn complex relationships between the input data by updating weights via backprop. This makes sense from the perspective of transforming input data, but it’s been pretty clear for awhile that large models are memorizing information. The date of a famous event, for example, is easily repeated by chatgpt. If I wanted to store that data outside of a network, I would just explicitly encode a vector to represent it instead of trying to model it as a complex series of connections between words or other latent, which seems like it would be much more complicated and less efficient. Likewise, instead of just creating connections between input data in my network I could have the input attend to a set of learnable tokens the model could use to encode world information. You’d probably want to interleave with input/input attention but it seems like learnable tokens would give a more efficient, or at least more explicit, method for networks to store data. The closest thing I’ve seen are the learnable position embeddings some networks use for modifying input tokens, or the VIT registers from [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16588](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16588) , but they still have a very limited use of learned input vectors. Is there a mathematical reason we don’t use learnable vectors, or paper that showed they are inferior to just more connections?  


Update for clarity:  
I don't think I communicated my question too well, apologies.  


Typical LLMs, like GPT, are made by stacking transformer blocks. Within the transformer blocks, there is a self-attention mechansim. Attention takes in two sets of tokens. T1 -> query, T2 -> key, value . Self-attention is a special case where you use the same set of tokens T1 to generate both query and key, value. The output of each transformer is used as input to the next one.

[Diagram of original GPT architecture. The stuff between the first two linear layers on the right side is attention.](https://preview.redd.it/qxn24sr60ffc1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b4b81c5fc4db20416bc46289a466972f4b91e06)

Instead of always doing self-attention, we could do cross attention to another set of tokens which are defined as part of the model. They get updated during backprop, but they are the same tokens for every run (we aren't trying to predict which ones are needed like RAG, or teaching the model to write and retrieve them like DNC, nor would we be explicitly encoding them somehow). They are just another part of the model weights. This would give the model the ability to learn information directly to a vector that can be attended to instead of storing it in the weights of a self-attention mechanism. The training procedure would be unmodified, this is just a structural change.

tl;dr: To democratize the technology behind virtual assistants, we can play a [Q&A game](https://open-assistant.io/) to build a collaborative dataset that will enable the creation of culturally and politically unbiased virtual assistants.

As AI becomes more ubiquitous in our lives, we need to democratize it, ensuring that the next generation of virtual assistants, such as chatGPT or BingChat, are not solely controlled by one company, group or country, as it would allow them to skew our reality more easily, by deploying politically and culturally biased assistants at large scale, as we have seen with OpenAI.

While one could argue that over time companies and startups will emerge and create their own alternatives, these could be few, as creating such virtual assistants is not only a matter of massive raw data and computation, but it requires the creation of very specific datasets (many of them created by experts from multiple fields) with the goal of ""fine-tuning"" Large Language Models (LLMs) into virtual assistants.

Because of this, there is an international collaborative effort to create a public, multilingual, and high-quality dataset through a Q&A game, that will enable the creation of other virtual assistants outside the control of these companies.

At this very moment, we already have more data than OpenAI had when it launched its first version of ChatGPT. However, the current dataset is strongly biased towards Spanish and English speakers, as they are the only ones who have contributed to it so far. Therefore, we need to encourage people from other countries and cultures to play this Q&A game in order to create a truly multilingual dataset with expert knowledge of all kinds, from all over the world. (This would allow the virtual assistant to even answer questions that have not been answered in their language).

For Spanish and English is already a reality. Let's make a reality for other languages too by writing a few of questions/answers in the OpenAssistant game!

ChatGPT generates believable output but, as many have noted, not trustworthy output. A lot of the use cases I see for future generative AI models seem to crucially depend on making believable AND truthful responses. But given that it's probably easier to make believable but non-truth responses (since more of them exist), I imagine that this is a very hard prospect. Is it even possible with current methods?

From my read, modern generative AI models can only increase correctness of output in 2 ways. Using more correct data, and using human labellers for fine-tuning. Having more correct data either requires much smaller datasets (even academic journals can't be considered correct since science evolves over time) or human expertise in correcting the data. So it seems like human expertise remains vital.

Now I know that human labellers were necessary to reduce the toxicity of GPT-3 responses. I read that something like dozens were used over a period of months, though I don't know if this is publicly shared by OpenAI. But how important is human training in driving up ""truthfulness"" of these models?

I briefly reviewed this paper and it talks about InstructGPT being better than GPT-3 at truthfulness, even with 1/100th of the parameters (1.3B parameters vs 175B of GPT-3). But I also understand that larger models tend to lie more, so that could be part of it. And even though it is ""more truthful"", the metric used to compare seems suspect to me, especially since ""InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes"", including making up facts.

It seems here like little improvement in truthfulness.

Without a clear path to increasing this vital metric, I struggle to see how modern generative AI models can be used for any important tasks that are sensitive to correctness. That's still a lot of cool things, but we seem far from even a good search engine, from assisting researchers, or even from coding support. (I have used ChatGPT for this latter purpose, and sometimes it helps me more quickly, but sometimes it makes it slower because it's flat-out false. Stackoverflow is generally much more trustworthy and useful for me so far.) And certainly we are really far from anything remotely ""AGI""."

193,machinelearning,chatgpt,comments,2023-10-05 16:15:11,[R] Is self-correction a viable method to improve LLM reasoning? Probably not.,Successful-Western27,False,0.84,25,170m0o7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/170m0o7/r_is_selfcorrection_a_viable_method_to_improve/,20,1696522511.0,"Can LLMs actually improve their own reasoning by self-correcting mistakes? A new paper from DeepMind and the University of Illinois looks to answer this quantitatively.

The results show that unaided, LLMs struggle at self-correction for reasoning tasks. The core issue is LLMs have trouble reliably evaluating the correctness of their own responses. They rarely identify flaws in initial reasoning. Sometimes LLMs even alter initially correct responses to become incorrect after self-correction! *(I've personally seen this when interacting with ChatGPT many times and you probably have too).*

More complex techniques like critiquing between LLM instances don't help much either. External feedback or guidance looks necessary to improve reasoning (Well, some interesting parallels to this paper [here](https://notes.aimodels.fyi/enabling-language-models-to-implicitly-learn-self-improvement/) about implicit improvement from preference data vs traditional RLHF).

Self-correction does show promise for things like making responses more polite or safe though. Criteria there are more clear-cut.

The authors argue we need to balance enthusiasm with realistic expectations on self-correction. It has a lot of limits for improving reasoning (at least with current models). But they suggest promising directions like incorporating high-quality external feedback from humans, training data, and tools. That could be key to unlocking self-correction's potential down the road.

**TLDR: Basically title... LLMs can't reliably self-correct reasoning yet.** Maybe hybrid techniques combining self-correction with external guidance could work but we need more research.

ChatGPT does this task quite well, but it's closed-source nature prevents it from being useful in documenting or commenting proprietary code. There's also limitations such as the amount of text ChatGPT will read or respond with.

Getting beyond these limitations is something I'm interested in pursuing, perhaps with the help of somewhere in this subreddit. Some assumptions you can safely make:

1. We can get (lots of) funding for the training, hardware, etc...
2. The end product should be on-premises
3. The inference does not actually need to run very quickly. If it costs millions to buy enough GPUs just due to VRAM limitations, we could simply run on CPUs and utilize ram, as long as inference could be done a few times per day.

So I guess my questions are where would we start? What model is best to fine-tune? How would you specifically fine-tune to improve specific use cases?"

So this all started with me wanting to talk to my local Alpaca bot from the bar to show my friend something. He’s a mobile developer and also recently unemployed like me, so the stars aligned and we built this thing over the last few weeks. 

Friendly AI is an app that is compatible with the [BaseBot](https://github.com/sergeybok/BaseBot) python library that we built. We are basically open sourcing the message protocol that it uses so that you can build your own “backend” for it that does whatever you want! I recently built myself a bot that allows me to write and run commands, shell scripts, and even python from my phone. Very handy when you went to the bar and forgot to commit and push your code. 

[Apple app is available](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-ai/id6447589849). The android app is currently in review so hopefully comes out later today.

If you are using Mac/Ubuntu the Quickstart command from the GitHub Readme should set you up with a starter project. If you either already have openai key on your system, or you create one and provide it on install, it will start you off with a simple ChatGPT wrapper (like the one that comes with the app if you Sign Up). 

If you are on windows I’m sorry neither of us has one so we couldn’t create an install script. However if you pip install the library and read the Readme you should be fine. 

Furthermore because it’s self-hosted, you can be sure that your data stays private. It’s stored on your own machine (in mongodb if you have it setup, in json files if you don’t). When you message your bots from the app the message data is sent directly to your bot and nowhere else. 

I think here of all places people will make good use of this tech. Because personally since I don’t have millions of dollars and can’t be actually working on proper LLM research by myself (which is what I’d rather be doing tbh), at least I can build cool stuff that uses the already existing models. 

The signup stuff isn’t necessary, the only reason why we built it is just to be able to limit people’s use of our bots, while also providing some access to them since without any bots you can’t try out the app. But we want people to build their own bots, and not simply use ours!

My hope was that it would remove a lot of the annoying parts of building bots and let people (including myself) concentrate on the actual interesting / ML /etc. parts of the problem — namely what the bot actually does in response to user prompts! And of course, the response doesn't actually have to use any LLMs (e.g. you can hook up your local stable diffusion model), or ML in general (as I said earlier I made a bot that simply executes the shell commands i give it). 

PS. Our servers are basically free-tier so in the off-chance that there’s a lot of downloads they might not hold up. But even if our servers are completely down that affects only our bots, you can still talk with your own bots!"

So I work at a company as an AI/ML engineer on a smart replies project. Our team develops ML models to understand conversation between a user and its contact and generate multiple smart suggestions for the user to reply with, like the ones that come in gmail or linkedin. Existing models were performing well on this task, while more models were in the pipeline.

But with the release of ChatGPT, particularly its API, everything changed. It performed better than our model, quite obvious with the amount of data is was trained on, and is cheap with moderate rate limits.

Seeing its performance, higher management got way too excited and have now put all their faith in ChatGPT API. They are even willing to ignore privacy, high response time, unpredictability, etc. concerns.

They have asked us to discard and dump most of our previous ML models, stop experimenting any new models and for most of our cases use the ChatGPT API.

Not only my team, but the higher management is planning to replace all ML models in our entire software by ChatGPT, effectively rendering all ML based teams useless.

Now there is low key talk everywhere in the organization that after integration of ChatGPT API, most of the ML based teams will be disbanded and their team members fired, as a cost cutting measure. Big layoffs coming soon."

[video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

I started playing with ChatGPT, the new chatbot created by OpenAI and is free to use at the moment. 

I asked it to describe a scene between Batman and Joker on a subway platform and the result is mind blowing! I let you have a read of the story yourself:

Generated by ChatGPT:

The scene is set in a dimly lit subway station, with the Joker standing on the platform, gazing up at Batman who is perched on a nearby overhead beam. The Joker is dressed in his signature purple suit and green hair, a wicked grin plastered across his face.

In his hand, he holds a deck of playing cards, flipping them expertly through his fingers. The sound of the cards shuffling echoes through the empty station.

Batman, dressed in his dark suit and cape, stares down at the Joker with a steely gaze. His muscles are tense, ready for any sudden movements from the villain.

The Joker cackles, his laughter bouncing off the walls of the station. ""Hello, Batsy! Long time no see. How's the crime-fighting business these days?""

Batman remains silent, watching the Joker carefully.

The Joker's grin widens. ""Come on, Bats. Don't be so serious all the time. Let's have some fun."" He tosses a card at Batman, who easily catches it.

""I'm not here to play games, Joker,"" Batman says in a grave tone.

The Joker's laughter turns into a maniacal cackle. ""But that's the whole point, Batsy! Life is a game. And I'm the master of it.""

He pulls out a bomb from his pocket and holds it up, the timer ticking down. ""Let's see how well you can play, shall we?""

Batman leaps down from the beam, landing gracefully on the platform. He advances towards the Joker, who backs away, still holding the bomb.

The tension in the air is palpable as the two foes face off, each ready to outsmart the other. The sound of the bomb's timer counts down, adding to the tension of the scene.

The Joker's grin never fades, even as Batman inches closer. ""It's always a pleasure to play with you, Batsy. But I think it's time for me to make my exit.""

With a flourish, the Joker disappears in a cloud of smoke, leaving Batman standing alone on the platform. The bomb detonates, causing a small explosion and sending debris flying.

But Batman remains unharmed, ready to continue the never-ending battle against the Joker and all the evil that plagues the city.

End of the story.

One may argue that no one is claiming that ChatGPT will be the only source of knowledge, and hence, why bother? Definitely, the Internet will be there. But so are the public libraries in the age of the Internet. Yet, most tend to access the Internet for its ease and speed.

227,machinelearning,chatgpt,relevance,2023-03-13 18:11:39,[D] ChatGPT without text limits.,spiritus_dei,False,0.88,64,11qgxs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11qgxs8/d_chatgpt_without_text_limits/,27,1678731099.0,"One of the biggest limitations of large language models is the text limit. This limits their use cases and prohibits more ambitious prompts.

This was recently resolved by researchers at Google Brain in Alberta, Canada. In their recent paper they describe a new method of using associative memory which removes the text limit and they also prove that some large language models are universal Turing machines.

This will pave the way for entire novels being shared with large language models, personal genomes, etc.

The paper talks about the use of ""associative memory"" which is also known as content-addressable memory (CAM). This type of memory allows the system to retrieve data based on its content rather than its location. Unlike traditional memory systems that use specific memory addresses to access data, associative memory uses CAM to find data based on a pattern or keyword.

Presumably, this will open up a new market for associative memory since I would happily pay some extra money for content to be permanently stored in associative memory and to remove the text limit. This will also drive down the price of associative memory if millions of people are willing to pay a monthly fee for storage and the removal of prompt text limits.

The paper does point that there are still problems with conditional statements that confuse the large language models. However, I believe this can be resolved with semantic graphs. This would involve collecting data from various sources and using natural language processing techniques to extract entities and relationships from the text. Once the graph is constructed, it could be integrated into the language model in a variety of ways. One approach is to use the graph as an external memory, similar to the approach taken in the paper. The graph can be encoded as a set of key-value pairs and used to augment the model's attention mechanism during inference. The attention mechanism can then focus on relevant nodes in the graph when generating outputs.

Another potential approach is to incorporate the graph into the model's architecture itself. For example, the graph can be used to inform the initialization of the model's parameters or to guide the attention mechanism during training. This could help the model learn to reason about complex concepts and relationships more effectively, potentially leading to better performance on tasks that require this kind of reasoning.

The use of knowledge graphs can also help ground truth large language models and reduce hallucinations.

I'm curious to read your thoughts."

[Discussion],altoidsjedi,False,0.86,213,13m70qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/13m70qv/does_anyone_else_suspect_that_the_official_ios/,117,1684528596.0,"I've noticed a couple interesting things while using the official ChatGPT app:

1. Firstly, I noticed my iPhone heats up and does things like reducing screen brightness -- which is what I normally see it do when im doing something computationally intensive for an iPhone, like using photo or video editing apps.
2. I also noticed that if I start a conversation on the iPhone app and then resume it on the browser, I get a message saying ""The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model."" I get this message regardless of if I use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, but NOT if I use GPT-4 with plugins or web-browsing.

This, along with the fact that OpenAI took 8 months to release what one might have considered to be relatively simple web-app -- and that they've only released it so far on iOS, which has a pretty uniform and consistent environment when it comes to machine learning hardware (the Apple Neural Engine) -- makes me thing that they are experimenting with GPT models that are conducing at least SOME of their machine learning inference ON the device, rather than through the cloud.

It wouldn't be shocking if they were -- ever since Meta's LLaMA models were released into the wild, we've seen absolutely mind-blowing advances in terms of people creating more efficient and effective models with smaller parameter sizes. We've also seen LLMs to start working on less and less powerful devices, such as consumer-grade computers / smartphones / etc.

This, plus the rumors that OpenAI might be releasing their own open-source model to the public in the near future makes me think that the ChatGPT app might in fact be a first step toward GPT systems running at least PARTIALLY on devices locally.

Curious what anyone else here has observed or thinks."

Mostly on the research side which immediately puts him very *hostile* against engineers. But I guess it is understandable given the fact that he works on Meta and Meta has faced a lot of backlash (for good and bad reasons), most especially with Galactica where their first rollout got so bad they had to close it immediately. It's also particularly funny given his political leaning that he is very spiteful of a company that uses *open-source knowledge* and builds on top of it.

Lately, his social media and statements are barrages against ChatGPT and LLM's. Sure, he may have a point here and there but his statements look very petty. Here are some examples

*""By releasing public demos that, as impressive & useful as they may be, have major flaws, established companies have less to gain & more to lose than cash-hungry startups.  If Google & Meta haven't released chatGPT-like things,* ***it's not because they can't****. It's because they won't.""*

*>* Except that anyone in the IT industry knows that big tech companies **cant release** something very fast because of politicking and bureaucracy in the system. It takes years to release something into public in big tech compared to startups.

*""Data on the intellectual contribution to AI from various research organizations. Some of organizations publish knowledge and open-source code for the entire world to use.* ***Others just consume it.""***

***>*** Then adds a graph where the big tech is obviously at the top of the race for most number of AI-related research papers (*without normalizing it to the number of researchers per org*)

*""It's nothing revolutionary, although that's the way it's perceived in the public,"" the computer scientist said. ""It's just that, you know, it's well put together, it's nicely done.""*

\> Except that it is indeed revolutionary in terms of the ***applied research*** framework -- *adding on top of open-source, state-of-the-art research and quickly putting it into production for people to use.*

*""my point is that even* ***the engineering work isn't particularly difficult.*** *I bet that there will be half a dozen similar similar systems within 6 months. If that happens, it's because the underlying science has been around for a while, and the engineering is pretty straightforward.""*

""*I'm trying to correct a \*perception\* by the public & the media who see chatGPT as this incredibly new, innovative, & unique technological breakthrough that is far ahead of everyone else.*  ***It's just not.""***

""*One can regurgitate Python code without any understanding of reality.""*

""*No one is saying LLMs are not useful. I have forcefully said so myself, following the short-lived release of FAIR's* ***Galactica****. People crucified it because it could generate nonsense.* ***ChatGPT*** *does the same thing. But again, that doesn't mean they are not useful.""*

He also seems to undermine the rapid engineering work and MLOps that come with ChatGPT which is funny because Meta hasn't released any substantial product from their research that has seen the light of the day for a week. Also, GPT3 to ChatGPT in itself in a research perspective is a jump. Maybe not as incremental as what Lecun does every paper, but compared to an average paper in the field, it is.

To say that LLMs are not *intelligent* and it just *regurgitates Python code* probably haven't used CoPilot, for example. 

It's a classic case of a researcher-engineer beef. And that a startup can profit from derivatives of research that big tech has published. OpenAI broke their perspective on the profit from research. Big tech tried to produce revolutionary research papers on a surplus but never puts them into production thinking that they are the only companies that could if they want to. Then once one company created a derivative of a large research work and profited from it, it baffled them. Although people could argue that Stable Diffusion did this first in the Generative Image Space.

It's one thing to correct misconceptions in the public. It's also one thing not to be petty about the overnight success of a product and an immediate rise of a company that got embraced warmly by tech and non-tech people. It's petty to gatekeep. At the end of the day, ML is not just about research, it's **applied research**. It's useless until it reaches the end of the tunnel. 99% of research papers out there are just tiny updates over the state of the art which has been a pointless race for about  a year or two, with no reproducible code or published data.

232,machinelearning,chatgpt,relevance,2023-07-17 16:12:12,[P] Chapyter: ChatGPT Code Interpreter in Jupyter Notebooks,Shannon-Shen,False,0.93,94,15269v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15269v8/p_chapyter_chatgpt_code_interpreter_in_jupyter/,17,1689610332.0,"I recently made a new JupyterLab extension called [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) (𝐂𝐡𝐚ts in Ju𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐞𝐫) that aims at solving many pain points when using other AI coding assistants. I want to share with y'all the tools as well as my thinkings while building this.

**What is Chapyter**

Chapyter is a JupyterLab extension that seamlessly connects GPT-4 to your coding environment. Here are the key features: 

* **Code generation from natural language and automatic execution**   
Simply adding the magic command `%%chat` at the beginning of the cell of a natural language description of the task, the code is generated and the results are shown in a few seconds.

https://i.redd.it/y7l0s9pf5hcb1.gif

* **Using coding history and execution output for code generation**  
By adding the `--history` or `-h` flag in generation, chapyter can use the previous execution history and outputs to generate the appropriate visualization for the loaded IRIS dataset.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7pu6cbug5hcb1.gif

* **In-situ debugging and code editing**  
The generated code might not be perfect and could contain bugs or errors. Since Chapyter is fully integrated into Jupyter Notebook, you can easily inspect the code and fix any errors or bugs (e.g., installing missing dependencies in this case) without leaving the IDE.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mz4n4qsh5hcb1.gif

* **Transparency on the prompts and AI configuration and allows for customization**  
We release all the prompts used in our library and we are working on easy customization of the used prompts and settings.
* **Privacy-first when using latest powerful AI**  
Since we are using OpenAI API, all the data sent to OpenAI will not be saved for training (see [OpenAI API Data Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). As a comparison, whenever you are using Copilot or ChatGPT, your data will be somewhat cached and can be used for their training and analysis.

**Why did I build Chapyter?** 

* Sometimes, I want to have an AI agent to *take over* some coding tasks, i.e., generating and executing the code and showing me the results based on some natural language instruction.
* I want the AI agent to be fully integrated in my IDE such that it can provide context-aware support and I can easily inspect and edit the generated code. 
* I want transparency on how the code is generated (knowing the prompts) and want to customize the code generation sometimes
* I want to keep my code and data private as much and I am hesitant to upload any WIP progress code/data elsewhere.

Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, NONE of any existing AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT Code Interpreter can satisfy all of the above requirements. We include more details here in our [blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter). 

Please check our Github Repo [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) and our [latest blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter) for more details. Feel free to try it out and looking forward to your thoughts :)"

I don't come from a machine learning background. I am just a programmer. So bear with me if they sound a bit dumb.

I was checking about chatGPT a bit the last week. I went through their papers and also tried out a fine tuning by myself by creating some fictional world and giving it some examples. 

The first thing I wondered is what is very special about the model than the large data and parameter set it has, that other competitors can't do. I ask this because I have seen a lot of ""google killer"" discussions in some places. From what I understood from their papers I thought it is something another company with the computing power and the filtered data can have up and running in few months. I see their advantage in rolling out to the public because with feedbacks from actual users all over the world it can potentially be retrained.

The second thing I wondered is its scalability. It feels to me that it is a very big challenge to keep it scalable in the future. Currently getting a long text out of it is kind of painful because it has to continuously generate. I think it is continuously calculating with the huge parameter set it has. I wonder also about new trends, if it needs to be retrained. I also used it for a fine tuning, where I created a fictional world with its own law and rules and the fine tuning took hours in the queue - so is it creating separate parameters for my case? that would be a lot considering how much parameter set they have."

But then the question; how do they get past prompt limits? Chunking doesn’t help as it still doesn’t get context in that case between prompts. Maybe they ask the same question with different chunks many times and then ask for a final result?

I have found 19 papers where they compared ChatGPT with fine-tuned models, but they are being published practically daily now. It seems that for the most of the classical NLP tasks, ChatGPT is not actually that strong and smaller fine-tuned models are  often much better. According to the API page, GPT-4 is not expected to  be much stronger on tasks like these. I think it is an interesting  perspective that shows that for many of the tasks we need to solve, GPT models are actually not the right tool.

There are of course many caveats in a comparison like this: People probably don't know how to utilize ChatGPT fully, but on the other hand the model can be contaminated by the testing data. As I see it, we are basically losing our ability to rigorously evaluate these close-sourced models, since we don't know what is in the training data and what they are doing with the prompts that are used every day.

tl;dr: To democratize the technology behind virtual assistants, we can play a [Q&A game](https://open-assistant.io/) to build a collaborative dataset that will enable the creation of culturally and politically unbiased virtual assistants.

As AI becomes more ubiquitous in our lives, we need to democratize it, ensuring that the next generation of virtual assistants, such as chatGPT or BingChat, are not solely controlled by one company, group or country, as it would allow them to skew our reality more easily, by deploying politically and culturally biased assistants at large scale, as we have seen with OpenAI.

While one could argue that over time companies and startups will emerge and create their own alternatives, these could be few, as creating such virtual assistants is not only a matter of massive raw data and computation, but it requires the creation of very specific datasets (many of them created by experts from multiple fields) with the goal of ""fine-tuning"" Large Language Models (LLMs) into virtual assistants.

Because of this, there is an international collaborative effort to create a public, multilingual, and high-quality dataset through a Q&A game, that will enable the creation of other virtual assistants outside the control of these companies.

At this very moment, we already have more data than OpenAI had when it launched its first version of ChatGPT. However, the current dataset is strongly biased towards Spanish and English speakers, as they are the only ones who have contributed to it so far. Therefore, we need to encourage people from other countries and cultures to play this Q&A game in order to create a truly multilingual dataset with expert knowledge of all kinds, from all over the world. (This would allow the virtual assistant to even answer questions that have not been answered in their language).

For Spanish and English is already a reality. Let's make a reality for other languages too by writing a few of questions/answers in the OpenAssistant game!

I've tried ChatPDF and another solution but it is extremely low quality in my experience.

Is the reason these solutions are terrible because the usage of embeddings is inherently lower quality because it has less context? Or is that wrong?

I'd love to try it with the 32k context window. But even that will be too small to fit both the data and my queries even if I sent in the prompts piecemeal.

Does anyone know if OpenAI is working on something (or if something is currently available that is similar quality) that has a massively higher context window? Are there big technical limitations to someone developing something with a massive context window? How much more would it cost per inference - does it scale linearly or exponentially as you increase the context window?

I'd ask ChatGPT these questions but it only runs through 2021! And Bard / Bing Chat are utterly useless.

I've seen something around Azure Opensearch linked to OpenAI APIs but it seems complicated to set up especially if I can't have ChatGPT walk me through it step by step.

Can Hemp CBD Help You Sleep Better?  
This article outlines some of the ways that CBD oil has been used to promote a good night’s sleep and the science behind the effects.  
Pain Relief  
In addition to reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation, CBD can also help treat pain.  
Medical marijuana has been known to provide relief from a number of conditions, including chronic pain caused by fibromyalgia, arthritis, and inflammation. One study showed that CBD can help reduce pain and improve the quality of life of patients who suffer from these conditions. The CBD in a tincture may help relieve anxiety symptoms. You can also use it to lessen the symptoms of anxiety like depression, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment.  
Because of its effectiveness in reducing stress and promoting a more restful night’s sleep, taking CBD can improve your overall sleep pattern, mood, and functionality during the day. As mentioned, CBD can increase the production of the sleep hormone serotonin and the “feel good” hormone, dopamine. This also explains why CBD oil is useful in fighting against mental health disorders like anxiety and depression.  
This plant-based oil interacts with the endocannabinoid system which is responsible for regulating the balance in our bodies. Once CBD oil is consumed, it helps the endocannabinoid system to release more of these natural pain and inflammation relievers which can, in turn, reduce pain and inflammation. CBD is non-psychoactive and does not have the psychoactive effects of THC. Instead, it is used to help improve the overall quality of life by treating pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and other ailments.  
This differs from opiates, which are known to be an essential player in pain management but are at high risk for addiction and tolerance and can be deadly. Opiates can increase the release of dopamine, causing addiction.  
Can I get CBD from eating the cannabis plant?  
When people refer to marijuana as having a THC content of “20%” or “30%”, that’s usually not accurate. They are likely referring to the total THC content in the plant. After the plant is cultivated and dried, the raw product can contain up to 30% THC. However, when THC is heated through the process of decarboxylation, the“

>  
>Xi'an Famous Foods: This small chain of restaurants serves up hand-pulled noodles and other traditional dishes from the Xi'an region of China. There are several locations throughout the city.

An Evaluation of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on mock CFA Exams,Successful-Western27,False,0.43,0,179xbzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/179xbzb/r_can_gpt_models_be_financial_analysts_an/,10,1697546069.0,"Researchers evaluated ChatGPT and GPT-4 on mock CFA exam questions to see if they could pass the real tests. The CFA exams rigorously test practical finance knowledge and are known for being quite difficult.

They tested the models in zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting settings on mock Level I and Level II exams.

The key findings:

* GPT-4 consistently beat ChatGPT, but both models struggled way more on the more advanced Level II questions.
* Few-shot prompting helped ChatGPT slightly
* Chain-of-thought prompting exposed knowledge gaps rather than helping much.
* Based on estimated passing scores, only GPT-4 with few-shot prompting could potentially pass the exams.

The models definitely aren't ready to become charterholders yet. Their difficulties with tricky questions and core finance concepts highlight the need for more specialized training and knowledge.

But GPT-4 did better overall, and few-shot prompting shows their ability to improve. So with targeted practice on finance formulas and reasoning, we could maybe see step-wise improvements.

**TLDR:** Tested on mock CFA exams, ChatGPT and GPT-4 struggle with the complex finance concepts and fail. With few-shot prompting, GPT-4 performance reaches the boundary between passing and failing but doesn't clearly pass.

I am aware of the tool ArxivGPT, which is a Google Chrome plug-in but unfortunately it only uses the abstract of a paper and not the entire PDF/paper document.

Are there any other open-source models that approach ChatGPT 3.5's performance?,Egan_Fan,False,0.75,15,154vlnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/154vlnr/d_disappointing_llama_2_coding_performance_are/,23,1689870178.0,"I've been excitedly reading the news and discussions about Llama 2 the past couple of days, and got a chance to try it this morning.

I was underwhelmed by the coding performance (running the 70B model on https://llama2.ai/).  It has consistently failed most of the very-easy prompts that I made up this morning.  I checked each prompt with ChatGPT 3.5, and 3.5 got 100% (which means these prompts are quite easy).  This result was surprising to me based on the discussion and articles I've read.  However, digging into the paper (https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/), the authors are transparent that the coding performance is lacking.

Are my observations consistent with the results others are getting?

I haven't had time to keep up with all the open-source LLMs being worked on by the community; are there any other models that approach even ChatGPT 3.5's coding performance? (Much less GPT 4's performance, which is the real goal.)"

The maker of ChatGPT had made progress on Q*, which some internally believe could be a breakthrough in the startup's search for superintelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as AI systems that are smarter than humans.
