Educators Strike Back?

How are teachers supposed to respond to this?  I think there are two possible responses to this.  One is the first, very understandable response, which is to attempt to catch the “AI cheater” in the act.  This reaction makes sense at the moment since educational organizations have not yet had time to understand and respond to the technology.  To help on that front, we have created a thorough review of how educators might catch the students who decide to become AI cheaters in the article at this link.

If You Can’t Beat’em…

However, in this article, we will look at what I believe is the second possible response educators can have to this technology: rather than trying to constantly stay ahead of this ever-evolving technology in order to try and “catch the cheater,” can we rather ask if there is a way of using generative AI as an educational asset?  Could we possibly view [machine learning](https://ai-solutions.pro/what-is-machine-learning-a-beginners-guide/) and [Natural Language Processing](https://ai-solutions.pro/what-is-natural-language-processing-nlp-the-ultimate-beginners-guide/) as a natural next step in the advancement of technology, much like math teachers eventually accepted the use of calculators in math class?

For any topic and any language, my first instinct is to

1. go to ChatGPT,
2. write down whatever I need my code to do,
3. copy paste the code
4. if it doesn't give out good results, ask ChatGPT to fix whatever it's done wrong
5. repeat until I get satisfactory result

I hate it, but I don't know what else to do.

I think of asking Google what to do, but then I won't get the exact answer I'm looking for, so I go back to ChatGPT so I can get exactly what I want. I don't fully understand what the GPT code does, I get the general gist of it and say ""Yeah that's what I would do, makes sense"", but that's it.

If I tried to code whatever GPT printed out, I wouldn't get anywhere.

I know I need to be coding more, but I have no idea where to start from, and why I need to code when ChatGPT can do it for me anyway. I'm not defending this idea, I'm just trying to figure out how I can code myself.

I'd appreciate your thoughts and feedback."

Background: I studied Cognitive Science, which included some Calculus and data structures in Computer Science. I'm not the MOST technical person there is, but I can comprehend concepts that tap into advanced computer science domains.

1. Google is dominant in online searching. Despite sustained efforts by companies with platform advantages, including Microsoft and Apple (Bing and Siri) attempting to make their search engines better, Google seems far and away the most preferred search engine worldwide.

2. Meanwhile... They seem to admit internally that GenAI isn't a race that they can sustainably win (https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither). The have no moat in this.

What is the technical cause of this?

I'm unfamiliar with the technical reasons for why they're so much better in search, but ChatGPT seems to think it's due to their data advantage and focus on user experience. But I'm still not sure why that cannot be overcome. Is search technology much more reliant on one aspect of tech infrastructure that cannot be overcome by other companies, whereas LLMs are dependent on open-source tech and data, and thus can be improved upon easily?

Is deep learning why they're so much better?"
