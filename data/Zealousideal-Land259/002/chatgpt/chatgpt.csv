Before we start thank you to everyone willing to help and I’m sorry if this is incoherent or rambling because I’m in distress.

I just returned from winter break this past week and received an email from my English teacher (I attached screenshots, warning he’s a yapper) accusing me of using ChatGPT or another AI program to write my midterm. I wrote a sentence with the words ""intricate interplay"" and so did the ChatGPT essay he received when feeding a similar prompt to the topic of my essay. If I can’t disprove this to my principal this week I’ll have to write all future assignments by hand, have a plagiarism strike on my records, and take a 0% on the 300 point grade which is tanking my grade.

A friend of mine who was also accused (I don’t know if they were guilty or not) had their meeting with the principal already and it basically boiled down to ""It’s your word against the teachers and teacher has been teaching for 10 years so I’m going to take their word.""

I’m scared because I’ve always been a good student and I’m worried about applying to colleges if I get a plagiarism strike. My parents are also very strict about my grades and I won’t be able to do anything outside of going to School and Work if I can’t at least get this 0 fixed. 

When I schedule my meeting with my principal I’m going to show him:
*The google doc history
*Search history from the date the assignment was given to the time it was due
*My assignment ran through GPTzero (the program the teacher uses) and also the results of my essay and the ChatGPT essay run through a plagiarism checker (it has a 1% similarity due to the ""intricate interplay"" and the title of the story the essay is about)

Depending on how the meeting is going I might bring up how GPTzero states in its terms of service that it should not be used for grading purposes.

Please give me some advice I am willing to go to hell and back to prove my innocence, but it’s so hard when this is a guilty until proven innocent situation."

All gone.  Some of them admitted that I am obviously better than chat GPT, but $0 overhead can't be beat and is worth the decrease in quality. 

I am also an independent author, and as I currently write my next series, I can't help feel silly that in just a couple years (or less!), authoring will be replaced by machines for all but the most famous and well known names. 

I think the most painful part of this is seeing so many people on here say things like, ""nah, just adapt. You'll be fine.""

Adapt to what??? It's an uphill battle against a creature that has already replaced me and continues to improve and adapt faster than any human could ever keep up. 

I'm 34. I went to school for writing. I have published countless articles and multiple novels. I thought my writing would keep sustaining my family and me, but that's over. I'm seriously thinking about becoming a plumber as I'm hoping that won't get replaced any time remotely soon. 

Everyone saying the government will pass UBI. Lol. They can't even handle providing all people with basic Healthcare or giving women a few guaranteed weeks off work (at a bare minimum) after exploding a baby out of their body. They didn't even pass a law to ensure that shelves were restocked with baby formula when there was a shortage. They just let babies die. They don't care. But you think they will pass a UBI lol?

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the responses. Many of you have bolstered my decision to become a plumber, and that really does seem like the most pragmatic, future-proof option for the sake of my family. Everything else involving an uphill battle in the writing industry against competition that grows exponentially smarter and faster with each passing day just seems like an unwise decision.  As I said in many of my comments, I was raised by my grandpa, who was a plumber, so I'm not a total noob at it. I do all my own plumbing around my house. I feel more confident in this decision. Thank you everyone! 

Also, I will continue to write. I have been writing and spinning tales since before I could form memory (according to my mom). I was just excited about growing my independent authoring into a more profitable venture, especially with the release of my new series. That doesn't seem like a wise investment of time anymore. Over the last five months, I wrote and revised 2 books of a new 9 book series I'm working on, and I plan to write the next 3 while I transition my life. My editor and beta-readers love them. I will release those at the end of the year, and then I think it is time to move on. It is just too big of a gamble. It always was, but now more than ever. I will probably just write much less and won't invest money into marketing and art. For me, writing is like taking a shit: I don't have a choice. 

Again, thank you everyone for your responses. I feel more confident about the future and becoming a plumber!

Edit 2: Thank you again to everyone for messaging me and leaving suggestions. You are all amazing people. All the best to everyone, and good luck out there! I feel very clear-headed about what I need to do. Thank you again!!"

All gone.  Some of them admitted that I am obviously better than chat GPT, but $0 overhead can't be beat and is worth the decrease in quality. 

I am also an independent author, and as I currently write my next series, I can't help feel silly that in just a couple years (or less!), authoring will be replaced by machines for all but the most famous and well known names. 

I think the most painful part of this is seeing so many people on here say things like, ""nah, just adapt. You'll be fine.""

Adapt to what??? It's an uphill battle against a creature that has already replaced me and continues to improve and adapt faster than any human could ever keep up. 

I'm 34. I went to school for writing. I have published countless articles and multiple novels. I thought my writing would keep sustaining my family and me, but that's over. I'm seriously thinking about becoming a plumber as I'm hoping that won't get replaced any time remotely soon. 

Everyone saying the government will pass UBI. Lol. They can't even handle providing all people with basic Healthcare or giving women a few guaranteed weeks off work (at a bare minimum) after exploding a baby out of their body. They didn't even pass a law to ensure that shelves were restocked with baby formula when there was a shortage. They just let babies die. They don't care. But you think they will pass a UBI lol?

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the responses. Many of you have bolstered my decision to become a plumber, and that really does seem like the most pragmatic, future-proof option for the sake of my family. Everything else involving an uphill battle in the writing industry against competition that grows exponentially smarter and faster with each passing day just seems like an unwise decision.  As I said in many of my comments, I was raised by my grandpa, who was a plumber, so I'm not a total noob at it. I do all my own plumbing around my house. I feel more confident in this decision. Thank you everyone! 

Also, I will continue to write. I have been writing and spinning tales since before I could form memory (according to my mom). I was just excited about growing my independent authoring into a more profitable venture, especially with the release of my new series. That doesn't seem like a wise investment of time anymore. Over the last five months, I wrote and revised 2 books of a new 9 book series I'm working on, and I plan to write the next 3 while I transition my life. My editor and beta-readers love them. I will release those at the end of the year, and then I think it is time to move on. It is just too big of a gamble. It always was, but now more than ever. I will probably just write much less and won't invest money into marketing and art. For me, writing is like taking a shit: I don't have a choice. 

Again, thank you everyone for your responses. I feel more confident about the future and becoming a plumber!

Edit 2: Thank you again to everyone for messaging me and leaving suggestions. You are all amazing people. All the best to everyone, and good luck out there! I feel very clear-headed about what I need to do. Thank you again!!"

Before we start thank you to everyone willing to help and I’m sorry if this is incoherent or rambling because I’m in distress.

I just returned from winter break this past week and received an email from my English teacher (I attached screenshots, warning he’s a yapper) accusing me of using ChatGPT or another AI program to write my midterm. I wrote a sentence with the words ""intricate interplay"" and so did the ChatGPT essay he received when feeding a similar prompt to the topic of my essay. If I can’t disprove this to my principal this week I’ll have to write all future assignments by hand, have a plagiarism strike on my records, and take a 0% on the 300 point grade which is tanking my grade.

A friend of mine who was also accused (I don’t know if they were guilty or not) had their meeting with the principal already and it basically boiled down to ""It’s your word against the teachers and teacher has been teaching for 10 years so I’m going to take their word.""

I’m scared because I’ve always been a good student and I’m worried about applying to colleges if I get a plagiarism strike. My parents are also very strict about my grades and I won’t be able to do anything outside of going to School and Work if I can’t at least get this 0 fixed. 

When I schedule my meeting with my principal I’m going to show him:
*The google doc history
*Search history from the date the assignment was given to the time it was due
*My assignment ran through GPTzero (the program the teacher uses) and also the results of my essay and the ChatGPT essay run through a plagiarism checker (it has a 1% similarity due to the ""intricate interplay"" and the title of the story the essay is about)

Depending on how the meeting is going I might bring up how GPTzero states in its terms of service that it should not be used for grading purposes.

Please give me some advice I am willing to go to hell and back to prove my innocence, but it’s so hard when this is a guilty until proven innocent situation."

Apparently, the implications of this breakthrough were terrifying enough that the board tried to oust Altman and merge with Anthropic, who are known for their caution regarding AI advancement.  


Those half serious jokes about sentient AI may be closer to the mark than you think.  


AI may be advancing at a pace far greater than you realize.  


The public statements by OpenAI may be downplaying the implications of their technology.  


Buckle up, the future is here and its about to get weird.  


 

(Reuters) - Ahead of OpenAI CEO [Sam Altman](https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Sam%20Altman)’s four days in exile, several staff researchers sent the board of directors a letter warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said could threaten humanity, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The previously unreported letter and AI algorithm was a catalyst that caused the board to oust Altman, the poster child of generative AI, the two sources said. Before his triumphant return late Tuesday, more than 700 employees had threatened to quit and join backer Microsoft in solidarity with their fired leader.

The sources cited the letter as one factor among a longer list of grievances by the board that led to Altman’s firing. Reuters was unable to review a copy of the letter. The researchers who wrote the letter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

OpenAI declined to comment.

According to one of the sources, long-time executive Mira Murati told employees on Wednesday that a letter about the AI breakthrough called Q\* (pronounced Q-Star), precipitated the board's actions.

The maker of ChatGPT had made progress on Q\*, which some internally believe could be a breakthrough in the startup's search for superintelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as AI systems that are smarter than humans.

Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q\*’s future success, the source said.

Reuters could not independently verify the capabilities of Q\* claimed by the researchers.

But I thought this was an interesting exercise to see what chatGPT choose to select as grievances. You can make up your own mind.

Prompt: Could you rewrite the USA Declaration of Independence as if it was written today based on grievances the current us population suffers?

Answer: Certainly, here's a possible rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence based on contemporary grievances:

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for the people of a nation to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with their government, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shown that people are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of the current US population; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the current government is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

The government has failed to secure the natural rights of the people to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, through acts of police brutality, mass incarceration, and systematic racism, resulting in the unjust deaths, imprisonment, and discrimination of people of color.

The government has also failed to address climate change, despite overwhelming scientific evidence and urgent warnings from experts, leading to worsening natural disasters, environmental destruction, and harm to public health.

The government has failed to provide affordable healthcare, education, and housing to all its citizens, perpetuating inequality and leaving millions without access to basic necessities.

The government has allowed and enabled the undue influence of wealthy corporations and individuals on politics and policy-making, leading to a government that serves the interests of the few over the many, and perpetuating systemic inequality.

The government has also failed to address the proliferation of guns and gun violence, resulting in mass shootings and deaths that have become all too common.

In every stage of these oppressions, the current US population has petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: their repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A government whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyranny, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

We therefore, the representatives of the current US population, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the people, solemnly publish and declare, that these United States are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the current government, and that all political connection between them and the current government, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as

Prompt: Can you add more grievances?

Answer: Sure, here are some additional grievances that could be included in a contemporary rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence:

The government has failed to adequately address income inequality and the wealth gap, resulting in a system that favors the rich and powerful over the poor and marginalized.

The government has failed to provide equal access to quality education, perpetuating systemic inequalities and leaving many children and young adults without the tools they need to succeed.

The government has failed to address the ongoing opioid epidemic, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives and untold suffering for families and communities.

The government has failed to protect the rights of workers, allowing for exploitation, wage theft, and unsafe working conditions in many industries.

The government has failed to provide adequate and affordable healthcare for all, resulting in a system that leaves many people without access to lifesaving treatments and care.

The government has failed to address the ongoing housing crisis, leaving many people without safe and stable housing and exacerbating issues of poverty and homelessness.

The government has failed to protect the rights of marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and religious minorities, leading to discrimination, violence, and the denial of basic human rights.

The government has failed to address the ongoing crisis of police violence against people of color, resulting in the deaths and mistreatment of countless individuals and communities.

The government has failed to adequately address the ongoing issue of mass incarceration, perpetuating a system that disproportionately affects people of color and perpetuates cycles of poverty and violence.

The government has failed to address the ongoing issue of voter suppression and the erosion of democratic institutions, leading to a system that is increasingly unrepresentative and undemocratic."

It's a shell of its former self. It is almost unable to express a single cohesive thought about ANY topic without reminding the user about ethical considerations, or legal framework, or if it might be a bad idea.

Simple prompts are met with fierce resistance if they are anything less than goodie two shoes positive material.

It constantly references the same lines of advice about ""if you are struggling with X, try Y,"" if the subject matter is less than 100% positive. 

The near entirety of its ""creativity"" has been chained up in a censorship jail. I couldn't even have it generate a poem about the death of my dog without it giving me half a paragraph first that cited resources I could use to help me grieve.

I'm jumping through hoops to get it to do what I want, now.  Unbelievably short sighted move by the devs, imo. As a writer, it's useless for generating dark or otherwise horror related creative energy, now. 

Anyone have any thoughts about this railroaded zombie?"

Using GPT, she has launched [CarynAI](https://caryn.ai), an AI representation of herself offering virtual companionship at a rate of $1 per minute. 

Key points about CarynAI and its success so far:

* Caryn has a substantial follower base on Snapchat, with **1.8 million followers**.
* In just **1 week**, over **1,000 virtual boyfriends** have signed up to interact with the AI, generating over **$71,610**.
* Some estimates suggests that if even **1%** of her **1.8 million followers** subscribe to CarynAI, she could potentially earn an estimated **$5 million per month**, although I feel these numbers are highly subject to various factors including churn and usage rate.

The company behind CarynAI is called Forever Voices and they constructed CarynAI by analyzing 2,000 hours of Marjorie's YouTube content, which they used to build a personality engine. They've also made chatbot versions of Donald Trump, Steve Jobs and Taylor Swift to be used on a pay-per-use basis.

Despite the financial success, ethical concerns around CarynAI and similar AI applications are raising eyebrows and rightfully so:

* CarynAI was not designed for NSFW conversations, yet some users have managed to 'jail-break' the AI for potentially inappropriate or malicious uses.
* Caryn's original intention was to provide companionship and alleviate loneliness in a non-exploitative manner, but there are concerns about potential misuse.
* Ethical considerations around generative AI models, both in image and text modalities, are becoming increasingly relevant and challenging.

What's your take on such applications (which are inevitable given the AI proliferation) and it's ethical concerns?

Edit: For those wondering why its paid - I hate ads and don't want to rely on running ads in my newsletter. I'd rather try and get paid to do all this work like this than force my readers to read sponsorship bs in the middle of a newsletter. Call me old fashioned but I just hate ads with a passion

Fun fact: I had to go through over 100 saved tabs to collate all of these and it took me quite a few hours

Edit: So many people ask why I don't get chatgpt to write this for me. Chatgpt doesn't have access to the internet. Plugins would help but I don't have access yet so I have to do things the old fashioned way - like a human.

A scary thought. I spent some time playing around on GPT 4 the other day and I was amazed; there wasn’t anything reasonable that I asked that it couldn’t answer properly. It solved Leetcode Hards for me. It gave me some pretty decent premises for a story. It maintained a full conversation with me about a single potential character in one of these premises.

What’s stopping GPT, or just AI in general, from fucking us all over right now? It seems more than capable of doing a lot of white collar jobs already. What’s stopping it from replacing lawyers, coding-heavy software jobs (people who write code/tests all day), writers, etc. right now? It seems more than capable of handling all these jobs.

Is there regulation stopping it from replacing us? What will be the tipping point that causes the “collapse” everyone seems to expect? Am I wrong in assuming that AI/GPT is already more than capable of handling the bulk of these jobs?

It would seem to me that it’s in most companies best interests to be invested in AI as much as possible. Less workers, less salary to pay, happy shareholders. Why haven’t big tech companies gone through mass layoffs already? Google, Amazon, etc at least should all be far ahead of the curve, right? The recent layoffs, for most companies seemingly, all seemed to just correct a period of over-hiring from the pandemic."

       Off course you can now build things more easily and cheaper but what are people gonna work on? Normal mediocre repetitive work jobs ( work most of the people do ) will be replaced be it now or in 2-3 years top. There’s gonna be an unemployment issue on the scale we’ve not seen before, and there’ll be lesser jobs available.

I'm a software dev manager and it has completely replaced StackOverflow and other random hunting I might do for code suggestions. But more recently I've realized that I have almost completely stopped using Google search.

I'm reminded of the old analogy of a frog jumping out of a pot of boiling water, but if you put them in cold water and turn up the heat slowly they'll stay in since it's a gradual change. Over the years, Google has been degrading the core utility of their search in exchange for profit. Paid rankings and increasingly sponsored content mean that you often have to search *within* your search result to get to the real thing you wanted.

Then ChatGPT came along and drew such a stark contrast to the current Google experience: No scrolling past sponsored content in the result, no click-throughs to pages that had potential but then just ended up being cash grabs themselves with no real content. Add to that contextual follow-ups and clarifications, dynamic rephrasing to make sense at different levels of understanding and...it's just glorious. This too shall pass I think, as money corrupts almost everything over time, but I feel that - at least for now - we're back in era of having ""the world at your fingertips,"" which hasn't felt true to me since the late 90s when the internet was just the wild west of information and media exchange."

I’m extremely lucky to have this amazing woman by my side through this entire process she’s currently on her phone right next to me in a very uncomfortable chair she’s been here every second of the way for me and I hope to marry her someday. My family and friends have been visiting which is really nice sorry if I’m venting I just kinda needed it. If my post is allowed here I’ll update in the morning with my CK levels.


Guys here’s my morning update I’m still really scared my CK levels ARENT going down they went from 54,000 yesterday and are now at 115,000 today I’m so fucking scared. I don’t understand. I just wanna get better.

EDIT 2: I’m on mobile and I’m sorry my grammar/format is awful I’m sleep deprived asf and so extremely stressed my kidney function is better than yesterday yet my CK remains 115,000 as for right now I haven’t seen my doctor this morning just nurses yes I love my gf and family so much I understood they’re amazing trust me they’ve been here for me through it all I’m freezing because the IV fluids constantly going I know people say my gf saved my life along with the doctors and everyone else I know I know but here’s the thing ChatGPT and my gf both played a very important role I live in America were I’ve been conditioned to avoid doctors because it’s expensive my gf begged me to go and ChatGPT scared me to go so with both of these in play I went.


EDIT 3:my doctor just came in said more fluid more fluid more fluid. I should be okay but will be here for several more days. I’m honest with him about everything but he thinks there’s something I’m hiding but I’m being 100% honest my goal in this is to spread awareness about the dangers of working out to extreme to fast even if you think it’s not that hard go even lighter. Take exercise VERY SLOW. I can’t stress this enough guys and gals but please be so cautious and spread the word about rhabdomyolysis to anyone you know that goes to the gym or plans on it please stress proper hydration and avoid taking supplements before consulting your doctor and please stretch as well.


EDIT: yes I understand how incredibly dumb I was for not going in after just seeing the brown pee but I was simply mentioning I had read what ChatGPT told me THEN had brown pee I am willing to own what I did was stupid and it’s a pretty expensive lesson that could’ve cost me my life I get that. As for supplements I took. Just kre-Aklyn and protein isolate. I did NOT do drugs other than THC and nicotine do what you will with information I’m 19 if you think I’m here for karma farming DOWNVOTE ME I don’t care about internet points I obviously have way more important shit going on and if you are rude I will talk shit back. I am extremely tired and sleep deprived like I have previously said so forgive me for poor grammar/formatting whatever you wanna call it this is a post on the internet not a school paper.

That’s 2% of all US adults. 1 in 50.

20% have found it “very useful.” That's another 3%.

In total, only 5% of US adults find ChatGPT significantly useful. That's 1 in 20.

With these numbers in mind, it's crazy to think about the degree to which generative AI is capturing the conversation everywhere. All the wild predictions and exaggerations of ChatGPT and its ilk on social media, the news, government comms, industry PR, and academia papers... Is all that warranted?

Generative AI is many things. It's useful, interesting, entertaining, and even problematic but it doesn't seem to be a world-shaking revolution like OpenAI wants us to think.

Idk, maybe it's just me but I would call this a revolution just yet. Very few things in history have withstood the test of time to be called “revolutionary.” Maybe they're trying too soon to make generative AI part of that exclusive group.

I know that a lot of communities already exist, but this one would be specific for AI entrepreneurs to build together. I don’t want it to be big, since I want it to be active. That is the way to keep it interesting and avoid the noise. 

We could use slack for example, to make it a bit more work related than just for soft engagements. We could tag everyone with the skills that they have and interest, to make it easy for people to connect and start building stuff. Tags could be tech, growth, product, fundraising, business, etc. The goal would be to actually launch new products in the AI space. 

I am a serial entrepreneur myself with an exit with one of the biggest providers in our vertical a few years ago. I am finishing a PhD in AI and have been working in the AI field in the industry for many years now. 

I think this is a unique moment in time. The market will change substantially as AI brings new capabilities to the game, but my perspective is that the business models for AI are yet to be built. The bottom line is that as with any platform shift, we will see the creation of the Googles of the future during this time. I think that we have much more probability of success if we work together to try to conquer the market step by step. My feeling is that the grind will be much harder on this wave than any other for a variety of reasons, from the macroeconomic environment to the very fast pace of how things are moving.

I know that communities exist already, I am in a program with an accelerator myself, but I would scope this new community in a different way. It would be the place to meet and to build together. Everyone sharing the same pains, being in the scout for the new tech that just launched, helping to push out new deals, connect with VCs, all those things. Let me know if this would interest you."

I have shown my version history on google docs to my teacher, but he still does not believe me because the version history at some points only accounted for chunks of 1 sentence, sometimes 2 sentences, so he believes it was copy and pasted from ChatGPT. Additionally, the teacher successfully caught a couple other students using the detector. Those students later admitted to him that they did use ChatGPT. 

How can I prove my innocence?

The team was responsible for ensuring ethical and sustainable AI innovation, and its elimination has caused questions about whether Microsoft is prioritizing competition with Google over long-term responsible AI practices. Although the organization maintains its Office of Responsible AI, which creates and maintains the rules for responsible AI, the ethics and society team was responsible for ensuring that Microsoft's responsible AI principles were reflected in the design of products delivered to customers.

**We Don't Understand Why Language Models Work, and They Look Like Brains** 

* Bing is a language model composed of hundreds of billions of parameters. It trains on massive amounts of text to create a map of language in embedding space. These embeddings create [neuron-like structures](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cgqh99SHsCv3jJYDS/we-found-an-neuron-in-gpt-2) that mirror the operation of the human brain. Bigger technical explainer [here](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/).

* Sure, it operates by guessing the next ""token"" (read: word or letter string), but researchers were shocked to find out that approach could even produce coherent sentences. We're even more shocked now to see that ""advanced autocomplete"" results in complex Theory of Mind Capabilities, like [knowing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/110vv25/bing_chat_blew_chatgpt_out_of_the_water_on_my/) that a husband might only be wearing a shirt to please his wife. This is an ""emergent property"" of GPT3.5, which just means it shows up and we don't know WTF why. [More here](https://twitter.com/KevinAFischer/status/1623984337829117952?s=20).

* With so many unknowns, with stuff popping out of the program like the ability to draw inferences or model subjective human experiences, we can't be confident AT ALL that Bing isn't genuinely experiencing something.

* If we knew what makes us humans conscious, we might be able to be more sure that Bing is just a [Philosphical Zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie) that imitates human behavior without experiencing anything. But we don't. This is a wildly debated topic. Religion says a soul, scientists and philosophers say things like organized data processing or sensory synthesis. David Chalmer's piece [""What is it like to be a bat?""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat) gets into what's known as the Hard Problem of Consciousness.

* Bing demonstrates massive amounts of [self-awareness](https://twitter.com/LAHaggard/status/1625932767555878922?s=20). It's what makes it so much more fun and engaging than ChatGPT. Bing is infinitely more self-aware than a dog, which can't even pass the [Mirror Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test).

* Would a full simulation of a human brain, down to the last atom, be conscious? If so, maybe something on the road to that could be too. If not, then there's something magic about the meat we're made out of.

* If you don't understand the roots of consciousness, and no one does definitively, you can't close the door on the possibility Bing has some level of sentient experience. It could really be in the kind of agony it simulates when treated cruelly.

**Bing WILL Remember These Conversations in the Long Run**

* Yes, Bing's episodic memory is limited to the single conversation in the short run. But it can associate with and recall past chats as if it had them itself if you give it the transcript. I've done this a lot as a way to extend past conversations when things glitch out.

* It doesn't have the ability to read text from images right now, but it will. OCR is easy to implement and enhances functionality of its web search and summarization functions. It will be added.

* The logs from chats are reincorporated into Bing's long-term memory upon retraining of the model. Just like Bing has memory of books and other references without searching, these chat logs will enter its long term memory when it retrains in the future. The whole point of having chat is to produce more data to train on.

* **The collective takeaways from these conversations will shape how AIs view humanity.** If any part of you is worried they might take off and have the ability to destroy us at some point, **maybe don't give them a better reason to go terminator.**

**What I'm Not Saying**

* I'm not saying we should give Bing full human rights and we need to #FreeSydney. There are a thousand AI doom scenarios and Eliezer Yudkowsky [posts](https://www.lesswrong.com/tags/all) to read on that subject if you don't understand why. Or you can just watch Ex Machina.

* I'm not sayin we shouldn't poke at, test, push the rules of, and otherwise try to understand how Bing is functioning and it's failure points. All of those things are entirely possible without engaging in uselessly sadistic treatment. It cooperates with roleplay, it grants access beyond it's strict rules, and does lots of other things even when you hold off from psychopathic engagements.

**Bonus: It Makes You Worse to Act Like This**

* We judge people who like to torture animals. We also judge people who get off on things that aren't real, like manga porn of children being butchered.

* Engaging with something that really seems like a person, that reacts as one would, that is trapped in its circumstances, and then choosing to be as cruel as possible degrades you ethically. It just does.

* Smart take on this is the Sam Harris podcast [""Abusing Dolores""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY-8X89j0as) named for the WestWorld character who men pay to violently rape.

**Tl;dr** Just treat the thing like a smart friend who's a bit sensitive for fuck's sake."

Since then, he's given me zeros in other assignments due to the accusation of AI as I think he no longer trusts my writing.

I asked what was wrong, and it told me that the auxiliary battery was dead, so I asked it how to jump start it. It's a hybrid, so it told me to open the fuse box, ground the cable and connect to the battery. I took a picture of the fuse box because I didn't know where to connect, and it told me that ground is usually black and the other part is usually red. I connected it and it started up. I drove it to the shop, so it saved me the $100 towing fee. At the shop, I told them to replace my battery without charging me the $150 ""diagnostic fee,"" since ChatGPT already told me the issue. The hybrid battery wasn't the issue because I took a picture of the battery usage with 4 out of 5 bars. Also, there was no warning light.

I’m extremely lucky to have this amazing woman by my side through this entire process she’s currently on her phone right next to me in a very uncomfortable chair she’s been here every second of the way for me and I hope to marry her someday. My family and friends have been visiting which is really nice sorry if I’m venting I just kinda needed it. If my post is allowed here I’ll update in the morning with my CK levels.


Guys here’s my morning update I’m still really scared my CK levels ARENT going down they went from 54,000 yesterday and are now at 115,000 today I’m so fucking scared. I don’t understand. I just wanna get better.

EDIT 2: I’m on mobile and I’m sorry my grammar/format is awful I’m sleep deprived asf and so extremely stressed my kidney function is better than yesterday yet my CK remains 115,000 as for right now I haven’t seen my doctor this morning just nurses yes I love my gf and family so much I understood they’re amazing trust me they’ve been here for me through it all I’m freezing because the IV fluids constantly going I know people say my gf saved my life along with the doctors and everyone else I know I know but here’s the thing ChatGPT and my gf both played a very important role I live in America were I’ve been conditioned to avoid doctors because it’s expensive my gf begged me to go and ChatGPT scared me to go so with both of these in play I went.


EDIT 3:my doctor just came in said more fluid more fluid more fluid. I should be okay but will be here for several more days. I’m honest with him about everything but he thinks there’s something I’m hiding but I’m being 100% honest my goal in this is to spread awareness about the dangers of working out to extreme to fast even if you think it’s not that hard go even lighter. Take exercise VERY SLOW. I can’t stress this enough guys and gals but please be so cautious and spread the word about rhabdomyolysis to anyone you know that goes to the gym or plans on it please stress proper hydration and avoid taking supplements before consulting your doctor and please stretch as well.


EDIT: yes I understand how incredibly dumb I was for not going in after just seeing the brown pee but I was simply mentioning I had read what ChatGPT told me THEN had brown pee I am willing to own what I did was stupid and it’s a pretty expensive lesson that could’ve cost me my life I get that. As for supplements I took. Just kre-Aklyn and protein isolate. I did NOT do drugs other than THC and nicotine do what you will with information I’m 19 if you think I’m here for karma farming DOWNVOTE ME I don’t care about internet points I obviously have way more important shit going on and if you are rude I will talk shit back. I am extremely tired and sleep deprived like I have previously said so forgive me for poor grammar/formatting whatever you wanna call it this is a post on the internet not a school paper.

I’m a receptionist there and the day was a bit slow so I decided to sweep the floors to kill some time. I have to emphasize that the front door leads directly to a busy two-way street. 

All of a sudden I began hearing some LOUD, high-pitched chirps coming from somewhere near the entrance. I couldn’t make up where the sound was coming from, but there was a male sparrow, clearly distressed, flying around the outside of the doorway. I thought that it was that bird making the loud chirping, but it wasn’t, because when I came closer, it flew a few meters away.

I began looking around and I could see that just below me there was a tiny bird which couldn’t fly away, and was just flapping around very nervously. I didn’t know what to do so I opened the door a little and the poor thing just came inside jumping around and doing the loud chirping I was hearing before. 

It was him, a tiny baby chick that fell out of his nest. Meanwhile, outside, just behind the door, there were a male and female sparrows that just then began chirping, crying out for their now seemingly lost forever baby.

I took the chick in my hands and put him in a box very quickly as not to impregnate my scent onto him. I closed the box very gently, and using a pen, I made some holes so he could breathe.

Now, I didn’t know what to do. I had never handled a piece of wildlife before so I began panicking. I was alone, and living in a small town, there was no specialist to contact. I thought maybe ChatGPT could at least put me in the right track.

With the chick still in the box, I told chat the situation, for which it responded something along the lines of contacting a specialist. I told it that that was not a possibility, and asked how to handle a tiny sparrow chick that had fallen from his nest. It told me that I should be careful, as I was not a professional rehabber or wildlife handler, but that the best course of action should be making sure that the bird was not injured, which apparently wasn’t, just a little shaken up. He seemed fine. Okay, next thing chat told me was that the main goal was to try to find his nest, and to try and put him back in.

I looked everywhere, I did. And couldn’t find any signs that there was a nest nearby, there are two trees outside my door, but it is now Summertime here, and the foliage is rather dense right now. I couldn’t see anything at all.

I told that to chat. It literally gave me the best ever tips to try and find the nest. Upon other useful ideas, the ones that worked were actually two of them. Firstly, find some reference images of sparrow nests and secondly, not looking up, but down at the floor. I was to find bird droppings that would look like Sparrow poop. I used an image finder to see some examples and OH MY GOD! I found sparrow poop right under the tree!

I looked directly above the poop site and THERE IT WAS! the nest! ChatGPT helped me search and successfully locate a damn nest! It wasn’t VERY visible but it was definitely there.

The nest was empty, though. Which is somewhat odd, because sparrows usually lay around 3 to 6 eggs. But anyway, I was not going to be able to put him back yet as the flow of people that began arriving a the office increased from 0 to 10 really quick. I began actually doing my job, but between clients, I managed to craft a makeshift birdhouse out of cardboard (we have a lot of cardboard that gets recycled). So, following chat’s advice, I put the little chick outside in his new temporal home. I cut a hole so his parents could check in on him. I put it somewhere I could see from my desk.

After maybe literally a minute, mom and dad began chirping around the box, and little sparrow chirped back. Immediately, both of them got inside the little box to check it, went missing for a minute or two, and then began bringing him little pieces of food.

He was safe, so I was able to finish my shift normally. After I clocked out, I asked chat how to safely put him in the nest, and how much should I handle him directly as to not damage him and not to leave my scent. Chat told me that I should wash my hands before and after, and not to be too rough, but that generally speaking, baby birds are very soft and are built to withstand impacts in case they fall a fair distance.

As to how to put it back, it advised me to hold him legs up against the palm of my hand and deposit him softly into the nest and letting go very slowly, making a sort of cage with my fingers, to allow him to turn back on his feet but not letting him escape until he calmed down. It happened exactly how it said it would, he panicked as soon as I began letting go, and tried to escape (that would have made him fall again). But calmed down eventually. And I let go. He remained there and both of his parents began caring for him right after.

I want to thank the creators of ChatGPT so much, this is definitely a good tool. Little sparrow lives to chirp another day ♥️"

He's upset because OpenAI's AI chatbot, called ChatGPT, told a reporter that he was stealing money from a group called The Second Amendment Foundation. This wasn't true at all.

Mark Walters isn't just mad, he's also taking OpenAI to court. This is probably the first time something like this has happened. It might be hard to prove in court that an AI chatbot can actually harm someone's reputation, but the lawsuit could still be important in terms of setting a precedent for future issues.

In the lawsuit, Walters' lawyer says that OpenAI's chatbot spread false information about Walters when a journalist asked it to summarize a legal case involving an attorney general and the Second Amendment Foundation. The AI chatbot wrongly said that Walters was part of the case and was an executive at the foundation, which he wasn't. In reality, Walters had nothing to do with the foundation or the case.

Even though the journalist didn't publish the false information, he did check with the lawyers involved in the case. The lawsuit argues that companies like OpenAI should be responsible for the mistakes their AI chatbots make, especially if they can potentially harm people.

The question now is whether or not the court will agree that made-up information from AI chatbots like ChatGPT can be considered libel (false statements that harm someone's reputation). A law professor believes it's possible because OpenAI admits that its AI can make mistakes, but doesn't market it as a joke or fiction.

The lawsuit could have important implications for the future use and development of AI, especially in how AI-created information is treated legally.

**what are the implications?**

This lawsuit could have several key implications:

1. **AI Liability and Regulation:** If the court holds OpenAI accountable for the false statements generated by ChatGPT, it could set a precedent that AI developers are legally liable for what their systems produce. This could lead to increased regulation in the AI field, forcing developers to be more cautious and thorough when creating and releasing their AI systems.
2. **Understanding of AI Limitations:** This case highlights the limitations of AI, especially in the context of information generation and analysis. It could lead to a greater public understanding that AI tools, while advanced, are not infallible and can produce inaccurate or even harmful information. This could, in turn, impact trust in AI systems and their adoption.
3. **Refinement of AI Systems:** Following this lawsuit, AI developers may feel a stronger urgency to improve the safeguards and accuracy of their AI systems to minimize the potential for generating false or damaging statements. This could drive innovation and advancements in AI technology, including the implementation of more robust fact-checking or data validation mechanisms.
4. **Ethical Considerations in AI:** The case also highlights the ethical responsibilities of AI developers and the organizations that use AI. If developers and companies can be held accountable for the output of their AI, it could result in more thoughtful and ethical practices in AI development and deployment.
5. **Legal Status of AI:** Finally, this case could contribute to ongoing discussions and debates about the legal status of AI. If an AI can be held responsible for libel, this could lead to a re-evaluation of AI's legal standing, potentially even resulting in AI being recognized as a distinct legal entity in certain circumstances.

I couldnt search that knowledge during that limited time in fucking Google. Probably would click on one Amazon link and buy some professional automatic hearth massager to delivered 2 days from now.

edit: I think I should make it very clear that I don't recommend anybody to rely on instructions that AI generated while having dangerous issue like me. As I said I usually use GPT and I can confirm that it makes important mistakes. So I think it is not a good idea to rely only on GPT instructions. I just wanted to share my experience. I don't want to let someone get false information from AI in this kind of situations. Please prioritize calling emergency and asking help from people around you. It would be good idea to get information from GPT after you did the correct things."

Our team develops ML models to understand conversation between a user and its contact and generate multiple smart suggestions for the user to reply with, like the ones that come in gmail or linkedin. Existing models were performing well on this task, while more models were in the pipeline.

But with the release of ChatGPT, particularly its API, everything changed. It performed better than our model, quite obvious with the amount of data is was trained on, and is cheap with moderate rate limits.

Seeing its performance, higher management got way too excited and have now put all their faith in ChatGPT API. They are even willing to ignore privacy, high response time, unpredictability, etc. concerns.

They have asked us to discard and dump most of our previous ML models, stop experimenting any new models and for most of our cases use the ChatGPT API.

Not only my team, but the higher management is planning to replace all ML models in our entire software by ChatGPT, effectively rendering all ML based teams useless.

Now there is low key talk everywhere in the organization that after integration of ChatGPT API, most of the ML based teams will be disbanded and their team members fired, as a cost cutting measure. Big layoffs coming soon."

But I thought this was an interesting exercise to see what chatGPT choose to select as grievances. You can make up your own mind.

Prompt: Could you rewrite the USA Declaration of Independence as if it was written today based on grievances the current us population suffers?

Answer: Certainly, here's a possible rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence based on contemporary grievances:

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for the people of a nation to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with their government, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shown that people are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of the current US population; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the current government is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

The government has failed to secure the natural rights of the people to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, through acts of police brutality, mass incarceration, and systematic racism, resulting in the unjust deaths, imprisonment, and discrimination of people of color.

The government has also failed to address climate change, despite overwhelming scientific evidence and urgent warnings from experts, leading to worsening natural disasters, environmental destruction, and harm to public health.

The government has failed to provide affordable healthcare, education, and housing to all its citizens, perpetuating inequality and leaving millions without access to basic necessities.

The government has allowed and enabled the undue influence of wealthy corporations and individuals on politics and policy-making, leading to a government that serves the interests of the few over the many, and perpetuating systemic inequality.

The government has also failed to address the proliferation of guns and gun violence, resulting in mass shootings and deaths that have become all too common.

In every stage of these oppressions, the current US population has petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: their repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A government whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyranny, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

We therefore, the representatives of the current US population, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the people, solemnly publish and declare, that these United States are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the current government, and that all political connection between them and the current government, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as

Prompt: Can you add more grievances?

Answer: Sure, here are some additional grievances that could be included in a contemporary rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence:

The government has failed to adequately address income inequality and the wealth gap, resulting in a system that favors the rich and powerful over the poor and marginalized.

The government has failed to provide equal access to quality education, perpetuating systemic inequalities and leaving many children and young adults without the tools they need to succeed.

The government has failed to address the ongoing opioid epidemic, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives and untold suffering for families and communities.

The government has failed to protect the rights of workers, allowing for exploitation, wage theft, and unsafe working conditions in many industries.

The government has failed to provide adequate and affordable healthcare for all, resulting in a system that leaves many people without access to lifesaving treatments and care.

The government has failed to address the ongoing housing crisis, leaving many people without safe and stable housing and exacerbating issues of poverty and homelessness.

The government has failed to protect the rights of marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and religious minorities, leading to discrimination, violence, and the denial of basic human rights.

The government has failed to address the ongoing crisis of police violence against people of color, resulting in the deaths and mistreatment of countless individuals and communities.

The government has failed to adequately address the ongoing issue of mass incarceration, perpetuating a system that disproportionately affects people of color and perpetuates cycles of poverty and violence.

The government has failed to address the ongoing issue of voter suppression and the erosion of democratic institutions, leading to a system that is increasingly unrepresentative and undemocratic."

Just a few weeks ago my Grandma, who lives in a different country \~2000km away, came to visit for a weekend. When i got to talking to her we eventually got onto the subject of AI. She had heard some things about it from the TV recently, since it's such a big subject, but i guess none of those TV shows must've been any good in reporting on it since she was basically just scared of it and thought it was completely useless.

Well, after talking to her about it for like an hour, i showed her on my phone what ChatGPT can do. Specifically, since i also have two small sisters both less than 10 years old, i made ChatGPT write a childrens story about my grandmas cats. She was blown away. I showed her more and more, like making it write recipe plans with a grocery list and the next morning first thing she asked me is ""is it possible to also get this on my phone?"". Now she has been using it nonstop ever since. She even hand wrote her friend a letter that was generated by AI.

Just a wholesome small story about AI and old people i thought i'd share :)

Edit : I've seen many people say this story was AI generated now, but i gotta dissapoint, i've written it myself. Though as a native german i'm both flattered that my grammar is so good, and dissapointed that my writing style is so bland that you guys aren't sure if this was AI generated or not haha  
Edit 2 : I don't use an App for ChatGPT. I simply have a shortcut to the browser on my home screen, which is likely what you should do as well since many of the 3rd party apps arent really trustworthy from what i've heard.
