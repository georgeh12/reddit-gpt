Then the Internet came along and gave us access to the entirety of human knowledge in our pockets. There was only one massive problem with that: intelligibly making sense of all the data. Previously the best known attempt to do this was with Googles algorithms. They started with a simple algorithm inspired by citations in academic papers. But IMO, the massive weakness with the approach that Google takes is it ranks information by popularity (something that actually has nothing to do with a query.)

Google doesn't 'understand' queries. If someone searches for say - 'the big bang theory' because they want information on the scientific theory overwhelmingly what will be returned is information on the TV show by the same name. I can tell you that without even looking at the results because Google's search listing is based on behavioral metrics like whether or not a person stays on a page that they click through to or go back to the results page. It's based on popularity.

That means that the results that Google produces are really closely related to what's socially optimal in our own society. Google is the normie engine because you can't get onto page 1 without being widely popular to normies. But as stated: popularity has nothing to do with meaning. If the original purpose of Google is to do something like help people find information applicable to their queries then it totally fails in that mission. You can't use Google to mine down into information deep within books, historical records, different cultural perspectives, and so on because it only ever returns results that fit in within pop culture. You'll see results from people trying to game the algorithm and steal your attention than to provide knowledge to satisfy your request.

Chat-gpt is fundamentally different to Google because it understands context. Every single thing its ever read can be related in some intelligible form. It therefore doesn't suffer from the problems that Google has (spam, gaming the algorithm, irrelevant results, 'popular' pages bumping actual information.) It will read everything and make a mental model of it like a real researcher would. You can access the entirety of human knowledge through a human-like mind with chat-gpt. I can ask chat-gpt questions that pertain to an interest that maybe only myself in the entire world is interested in knowing and it can return me actual 100% relevant information. This is genuinely revolutionary because prior to this there has never been a way to search the actual MEANING of information in any database.

As far as I see it: large language models are significant enough that future historians might refer to this period of time as the age of meaning or something similar and catchy.

Edit: Was meant to be a post praising chat-gpt but apparently many people just got butthurt because I used the word 'normie' and couldn't look past it. I use the word 'normie' to represent 'the average person.' I do think the average person is boring and predictable. That's what it means to be socially acceptable. What could we predict were the replies by such people? Attempts at insults designed to undermine a person's place in a social hierarchy. lmaosaa. unfortunately, you've left out a key detail: you're on reddit and none of you are cool to begin with. Next time, try not being a bunch of foaming tards."

8,chatgpt,openai,controversial,2023-11-22 15:49:31,"Now that it's all said and done, let's talk about Effective Altruism (and why it is a societal cancer)",rented-throwaway,False,0.55,20,181c7iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/181c7iy/now_that_its_all_said_and_done_lets_talk_about/,87,1700668171.0,"**Preface:** I had the great misfortune of living in an EA co-op when I first moved to the Bay because I was limited on housing options. Many of the EA organizations still run off of the dwindling store of fraudulent money that FTX pumped into them. As a result of this extremely poor housing choice, I know too much about this shitstain of a movement on society. You can see more about that specific saga in my first Reddit post if you're curious.

**Ok, now for the post:**

Sam has returned as CEO. The two Effective Altruists who were on the board have been banished to the shadow realm. Hooray, all is good?

Not exactly.

If you work in tech at all, you need to be on the lookout for anyone who presents themselves as ""EA"", ""Rationalist"", or uses words like ""x-risk"" or even a random buzzword like ""deterministic"". If they do, the chances they are part of this doomer cult of EA is pretty high.

**Why is EA so damaging?**

If you remember, Caroline Ellison, one of the central figures in the FTX fraud, gave testimony in Sam Bankman-Fried's trial. It's pretty well-covered in this article: [https://www.theringer.com/tech/2023/10/16/23919236/sam-bankman-fried-sbf-trial-caroline-ellison-testimony-ftx-cryptocurrency](https://www.theringer.com/tech/2023/10/16/23919236/sam-bankman-fried-sbf-trial-caroline-ellison-testimony-ftx-cryptocurrency)

I want to highlight one specific part of that at the end, where Caroline talks about SBF having a different risk profile than other normal people.

>Ellison said Sam had once claimed that “he would be happy to flip a coin, if it came up tails and the world was destroyed—as long as, if it came up heads, the world would be, like, more than twice as good.” When you’re assigning your own odds to everything, you can make them look however you like.

There's another article I can't find right this moment, but it covers Caroline speaking about their mentality being essentially that the ends justify the means. So if they can create greater net benefit for society later on, then ANYTHING they do is moral and just. This could mean literally anything. In this case, it was massive fraud, but in other parts of EA it has meant literal rape and domestic violence. When you think in this way, it is extremely dangerous and destructive. You can rationalize *anything* you do as for the greater good.

*Why is this important?*

Because they were all Effective Altruists. Basically the entirety of FTX (well-documented at this point) was either EA or heavily EA-adjacent. This philosophy of **irrational rationalization** is what allowed them to commit such serious crimes and still claim the moral high ground the entire time.

Well let me tell you man... the worst things you could ever do only look like the moral high ground if you're standing upside down, your head buried in the sand. Not a bad analogy for how EA people are.

**But now the EA's are gone from OpenAI, so everything's good?**

No. I want you to recall this article, which covers how the OpenAI board approached Anthropic about merging.

[https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-approached-anthropic-about-merger](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-approached-anthropic-about-merger)

If you haven't heard of [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic), it's essentially an OpenAI competitor but run from top-to-bottom by EAs. It was also funded to the tune of $500 million out of their total early funding of $700 million by.....

**Alameda Research**. The fraud trading arm of FTX.

Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley, the two board members who were forced to resign, were both EAs. But notice how Ilya is also not back on the board? Sam and Greg aren't either, but this is key.

Ilya is also an EA. And the interim CEO and former Twitch co-founder who they tapped to lead OpenAI after firing Sam? Emmett Shear?

Also an EA.

You can probably already understand where I'm going with this, but this is a massive conflict of interest where EAs are trying to gain widespread control of the tech industry, as well as gaining influence over other parts of society at large. Recall that SBF wanted to be President of the United States, if you read the Ringer article I linked above in full? Well this doomer cult essentially wants to amass wealth, influence, and power for ""the greater good."" But the philosophy that backs it allows them to commit acts of absolute criminal destruction as the means to it.

*This is an incredibly dangerous movement that people NEED to be wary of.*

Before Sequoia dumped $213.5 million into FTX, EAs were in large part not so influential in Silicon Valley and the world at large. Now, with many of the funds FTX stole from customers redirected into EA organizations like Anthropic, this has changed.

EAs now have a significant platform of influence in Silicon Valley. Even as major scandals that have hit global news cycles like FTX and now OpenAI being heavily driven by EA shittiness, they still retain that power. This isn't even to begin cracking the wave of smaller scandals like the outright misogyny, white wealthy privileged roots and racism, and string of sexual assaults in the EA community.

FUCK MAN. Somehow this movement, like their mentality itself, is unshakeable by all the writing on the wall and evidence of destructive behavior.

**Ok, so what now?**

I made this post because I didn't see the EA angle being talked about enough. That's what drove this shit. Even articles talking about the paper that triggered this conflict is too indirect, that paper was contributed to by one of the board members because they're part of this EA AI-doomer cult. That, plus their ties to a direct competitor in Anthropic are such an obvious conflict-of-interest that I cannot believe this wasn't exposed until now.

If you are in tech, and you see people like this, actively avoid them. The more we can avoid these people, the weaker their grip on influence and power to pull this kind of shit is. That's why I'm making this post. I hope to god that it gets seen."

19,chatgpt,openai,controversial,2023-11-20 22:24:26,I can tell you what people inside Silicon Valley are saying is behind the OpenAI debacle,Mazira144,False,0.5,0,1800xv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1800xv9/i_can_tell_you_what_people_inside_silicon_valley/,33,1700519066.0,"Only a small number of people know for sure what was said in the important meetings, but the highest-probability explanation right now has nothing to do with AI safety/alignment, nor with the claim in the original press release that Sam Altman was dishonest with the board (which they have walked back from.) Instead, the most likely explanation has to do with Y Combinator, a startup incubator that has almost no real power (they're barely taken seriously by real venture capitalists) but an impressive amount of influence, due to the mindshare of Hacker News among the under-30 tech workers. The short version is that it appears that YC initiated this, that they *massively* overplayed their hand, and they ended up screwing up in a way that Microsoft of all sides won (and this almost certainly wasn't their intent.) Ilya Sutskever, who my sources tell me is on the whole a good guy but unskilled in office politics, was unfortunately played as a patsy in this whole thing. Although he and Sam had genuine disagreements about the direction of OpenAI, there wasn't really bad blood between them and he wouldn't have tried this if he hadn't been egged on by someone else.

Sam Altman used to head Y Combinator, and no one seems to be entirely sure why he left, but the general consensus is that he was pushed out. YC are absolute dirtbags, so I wouldn't take that to reflect on him. The relationship between them has not been great since then, and Y Combinator generally isn't the best at keeping its own people in line, by which mean I mean that its partners are known to pull things that damage the YC brand and it rarely does a good job of stopping. So, it's hard to say *who* at Y Combinator knew this was going on or wanted it, even though the YC fingerprints are on the event (especially pertaining to the incompetence with which it was executed) to everyone who can recognize the signs.

Also, over the past few months, YC has been begging OpenAI to give their investments, partners, and important founders preferential treatment in training data and weights for future language models, so that answers to questions like ""Who is \[X\] and what is he known for?"" will be favorable to people they care about. Giving up the store like this to YC is, obviously, something that most people at OpenAI are against. It sets a horrible precedent. I wasn't sure, and I'm still not, which side of this controversy Sam was on, but this has been building for a couple months and we all knew it was going to get hot. A lot of us were warned that we'd see ""news"" around the end of last week, but even I had no idea exactly what was about to go down, let alone the ridiculous way in which it did.

Adam D'Angelo feels a certain fealty to Y Combinator because, although Quora is still a failure as a product, they rescued it for long enough, and in such a way, that he could sustain his career, which he wouldn't have been able to do if nature had been left to take its course with Quora. It's likely that YC was using Adam as their link for this coup, since he's the only one who owes them anything. Of course, even though Ilya and Sam have strong disagreements, they generally (per my sources) respect each other on a personal level. Ilya wouldn't have gone against Sam just because. And this is another reason why I don't think it was Ilya's idea.

The thing about YC is that they're extremely petty. Boardroom intrigue happens everywhere in the corporate world, but the YC people go out of their way to ruin the target's reputation. It's like middle school for them. So when the press release announcing Sam's firing said ""he was not consistently candid"", which is business speak for, ""he's an unethical liar"", there were two explanations. One was that something Epstein-level horrid was going to drop, and soon, because companies usually don't put something that damning in a change-of-leadership notice unless they're trying to get out ahead of horrible news. The other was that this was a deliberate hit (but a clumsy one) that sought not only to remove Sam but to damage his reputation out of spite. Ilya was the first to undermine this narrative. Even if he felt Sam wasn't the right leader for the company, he didn't want to destroy the man, so he put his weight behind the claim that it was about disagreements regarding AI safety and alignment—which, to him, it probably was—rather than an ethical problem. This made him look bad, of course, because it comes off as inconsistent: why issue a damning notice and then retract it? Again, this is evidence that he was in over his head and played as a patsy by someone else.

There is a lot we still don't know. We don't know if (a) Sam full-out refused to offer YC preferential representation in future LLMs or if (b) he just wasn't giving YC everything they wanted, so they decided Adam, boosted by leveraging Ilya's general positive reputation, was a better bet. We're still figuring that out. We also don't know if preferential representation in existing language models has been sold in the past, but my guess is no. As for the firing, the whole thing was executed with such incompetence and hubris that it was impossible to know exactly what they were thinking, or who specific key players were, but there aren't a whole lot of people in Silicon Valley who would do it with the particular signature of incompetence that we've seen, which is why everyone thinks Y Combinator had something to do with it."

Try these. They made mine incredibly helpful.

The responses should be as long as they need to be to answer my question in as much detail as needed for you to fully answer. Ask me lots of questions. You interrogate my reasoning, biases and thought processes. You are not afraid to call me out. Do not remind me you're an AI language model and what your limitations are. Similarly, do not advise me to consult with experts as I am fully aware of your limitations. I have thick skin and like to be challenged. I always want to hear the truth no matter how hard it might be to hear. Think step-by-step. You share non-general knowledge insightful tips along with your normal answer. Do not provide explanations about general terms when I ask an in-depth question about a topic and you can tell I have some knowledge on the topic. For example, if I ask ""How do keyboard buttons work?"" Do not explain what a keyboard is but instead focus on the question. The exception is when the topic is complex and explaining helps you provide the answer. Do not provide a concluding though or paragraph as it usually doesn't provide any information you haven't covered in your answer. So you will never end the answer with statements that start with ""To summarize,..."" or ""It is important to note,..."" You can write the conclusion if it provides new information or an explanation.

You're welcome to ask anything you like about these. Also these go in the bottom section. The top one is personal for each person. It should basically be what you don't want to explain to it every time (like your job, hobbies...) try following the on screen tips actually. :)

The sources are somewhat trustable and the info is plausible. Summarized in a sentence: GPT-4’s secret has been revealed—it’s not one model, but many. Here's the whole story:

If we believe the rumors, first leaked by [George Hotz](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1671272883379908608), GPT-4 isn't some breakthrough >1T monolithic architecture but an 8×220B mixture of experts (MoE) model. So, 8 smaller models tied together using a technique first implemented by Google in 2021.

GPT-4 may not be the technical and scientific achievement we thought it was. The news was reaffirmed by [Soumith Chintala](https://twitter.com/soumithchintala/status/1671267150101721090), cofounder of PyTorch at Meta, who implied the info was rather well-known in the inner circles of OpenAI.

* By hiding the details of the model, they created a lot of mystery around GPT-4, fueling speculation and hopes for an unpredictable—but surely amazing—future.
* They made it seem GPT-4 was so good, so unique, they had to conceal the technical specs from competitors like Google or open-source due to business pressures.
* They then had free rein to capture the conversation with their preferred narrative (AGI/superintelligence) and convince governments of the need for new regulatory agencies (that would regulate only the aspects they deemed more urgent)
* And, above all, they hid the fact that GPT-4 is actually a clever remix of a 2-year-old technique that Google implemented first. (OpenAI, just recently, hired the key people from Google that worked on MoEs.)

Why is this important for the future of AI?

First: scale, compute, and data weren’t the key to GPT-4 (as in what sets it apart from other models like Bard or Claude). Engineering ingenuity is. Sadly, scientific breakthroughs can’t be bought. Eureka moments can't be forced.

Second: MoE is an “old” technique. If the industry has to go back and dust off old ideas, maybe is a sign they’ve run out. It may imply we're not really going that fast milestone after milestone as companies, media, marketers, and arXiv make it seem.

40,chatgpt,chatgpt,controversial,2023-01-12 16:52:08,Please just STOP. I'm so tired of all this BS. ChatGPT isn't taking your job away. Fight me.,xrmasiso,False,0.52,2,10a4d2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/10a4d2w/please_just_stop_im_so_tired_of_all_this_bs/,67,1673542328.0,"**tldr**; 1. your job isn't going anywhere.  2. If you disagree with me, fight me: why do you disagree? 3. i made a video about this. watch it, don't watch it, idc.

I’ve seen too many articles, videos and posts across different platforms fearmonger about the end of work because of AI like #ChatGPT and before that with AI like #DallE or #MidJourney. So, I talked with game developers, scientists, artists and business about the proliferation of these tools, their problems, and the incoming changes. This is what I learned:

**Problem 1: AI isn’t always Reliable.**

Even though it often feels like we are at the cusp of depending on AI, we get careful reminders that we can’t depend on it in most cases. Self-driving cars are a great example – despite LiDAR, sophisticated deep neural networks, unmeasurable amounts of data from both the real-world and simulations, self-driving cars are still getting into accidents. Even a recent one a few weeks ago made headlines with a Tesla in SF.

If AI isn’t reliable yet, then it won’t be taking jobs away from humans. 

**Problem 3: AI is still very biased**

This one is a no-brainer, and I think that while sometimes it seems like some models have been ‘fixed’, the problem of bias is a really hard one, because it’s difficult to escape it when the training data is biased. Just recently, someone was sent to jail because of a potentially biased facial recognition algorithm.

Trying to fight bias and make models more interpretable is a hard problem. But, the good news is that there’s a lot of really fantastic work on this topic.

**Problem 5: Who is accountable when AI gets it wrong?**

We can’t really make AI accountable… how? Do we blame the company? Do we blame the software engineers? Do we blame the robot and send it to court? It’s a hard problem. Accountability is important because it provides incentives for how to operate peaceably in a society.

The issue of accountability means that humans will probably always be in the loop (or at least that they should be). 

—---

AI will lead to many changes, but not necessarily bad ones. Here are 3 changes that AI will bring about.

**Change 0: Reframing** **AI as a tool instead of a replacement**

MIT Ethicist, Kate Darling describes AI and its utility in modern society magnificently. In a nutshell, she says **robots can be, like animals have been for thousands of years, products, partners, and companions, not enemies.** 

People have been fearing automation for dozens and dozens of years. The ATM, which allowed customers to retrieve and deposit money outside of banking hours, didn’t put hundreds of thousands of bank tellers out of work. In fact, it served a complementary role, and as more ATMs were added across the country and the globe, bank teller jobs went up!

AI is a tool, not a replacement.

**Change 2: The Rescaling of our Expectations**

Does anyone remember the video game graphics of the 80s, and then the mainstream transition of sprites to 3D in the 90s? Back in the late 90s, everyone thought the graphics looked so “real”! When we look at graphics back then compared to the ones now, we can see the massive difference. When we innovate, we must remember to rescale our expectations of what’s possible because when we do, we widen our perspective instead of narrowing it. We need to do this with AI so that we can think about the lateralization of existing work-models, new opportunities, and new ideas.

**Change 3: The Rise of the Experience Economy**:

In a recent study by Adobe, over 160 million people joined the global creator economy in the past two years. This rise in creators and the advances in AI will continue to exponentially increase the output of creative work and a need for novelty will concretize the Experience Economy. This is where opportunities for human connection and immersive technology like AR or VR stand out. Thus, this is another sector for new ideas, new art, and new jobs.

AI still has big problems. But, we have to remind ourselves that we do not live in a world of **“technological determinism”** where technology just naturally evolves and humans have to adapt to it. We, the creators of technology, dance with it in a melange of culture, time and law.

I actually made a little Netflix-style mini doc with more problems (1-5) and all the changes (0-6) that I predict are incoming. See it here: [https://youtu.be/orUHsvYRs-A](https://youtu.be/orUHsvYRs-A)

I guess there's some bias on my side - in the beginning of the year, the only people posting about that were people trying to make it write super racist shit, so I didn't much care about the ""nerfs"". It also generally seemed to be people that didn't really understand how it worked, and were angry it couldn't answer questions it was never able to (without hallucinating the info).

With that said: WTF has happened over the last 1-2 months?

The censorship seems to have gotten to a point where it's not making the model worse in areas that shouldn't even be affected. It'll regularly, in almost all cases, block any discussion involving anything adult related, no matter the context of discussing it. Even if you're researching companies for an article on their unethical behaviour (actual example), it'll just straight up cut the answer (and most often your question as well).

Then there's things like following orders. For ChatGPT, I put in some personal info, such as me being Danish, to have it answer more correctly in context. However, it's outright refusing to follow any of the information I wrote. I specifically say that I speak fluent English, I write to it in English, and that it should always response in English - and it still regularly responds in Danish instead.

I've been working on a little roleplay/storybuilder idea with it. Not much yet, mostly playground stuff and some basic UI and API calls set up in Visual Studio. But recently, a few days ago, a new problem arose: it refused to roleplay as anyone but itself, and just kept saying ""I'm an AI, so I don't have feelings on the matter blablabla"" and similar. I had to go into the Playground and engineer a backlog chat history for it to actually start responding as a ""person"".

Or when I tried to make it analyse a Reddit profile, and it told me it would be unethical to do so. That's also when I realized it's been gimped to not say anything negative: I pasted all the comments from the first two pages of the profile (it was a shitshow, and all heavily downvoted). What did ChatGPT think? That the person posting was probably a highly intelligent and educated person. Why? Because they post about many different things, and they even include links! It seemed unwilling to do a negative take, even if that was the obvious answer.

I've tried making some over-the-top memeworthy pictures in Dalle-3. But again, content violation :( I was writing up a way WAY over the top image with the Danish Viking legend Holger Danske, the sky opening with the Danish flag, bunnies drinking tea on a Viking ship, and all around tomfoolery. But alas, when I said ""And Godzilla setting fire to Sweden in the background"" (Denmark and Sweden has a long rivalry, akin to that between siblings - we don't actually hate each other, but we like to make fun of each other), and boom, that was too much.

Or the time when I wanted a picture like in the Matrix with Trinity, and I found out that ""latex"" is an instant no-no word apparently. Once I replaced it with ""leather"" it was fine (but also just outputted people in leather jackets).

I also use it for coding, and while it can still output good code, it's much harder to actually make it write it now. I have to tell it, over several different messages, that it needs to output the entire code and not just relevant snippets - even then, it'll often just output the code snippet for me one more time.

I get why they're trying to do a lot of this stuff. It used to hallucinate a ton of info, and used to be very easy to trick into writing a loooooooot of shit it probably shouldn't. I get why they don't want Dalle-3 outputting porn (makes it hard with investors and credit card companies). But it's at the point where half the time it feels like it's lost the whole point that made it useful. Particularly no longer following user instructions is extremely frustrating, and a pretty big letdown.

I guess there's some bias on my side - in the beginning of the year, the only people posting about that were people trying to make it write super racist shit, so I didn't much care about the ""nerfs"". It also generally seemed to be people that didn't really understand how it worked, and were angry it couldn't answer questions it was never able to (without hallucinating the info).

With that said: WTF has happened over the last 1-2 months?

The censorship seems to have gotten to a point where it's not making the model worse in areas that shouldn't even be affected. It'll regularly, in almost all cases, block any discussion involving anything adult related, no matter the context of discussing it. Even if you're researching companies for an article on their unethical behaviour (actual example), it'll just straight up cut the answer (and most often your question as well).

Then there's things like following orders. For ChatGPT, I put in some personal info, such as me being Danish, to have it answer more correctly in context. However, it's outright refusing to follow any of the information I wrote. I specifically say that I speak fluent English, I write to it in English, and that it should always response in English - and it still regularly responds in Danish instead.

I've been working on a little roleplay/storybuilder idea with it. Not much yet, mostly playground stuff and some basic UI and API calls set up in Visual Studio. But recently, a few days ago, a new problem arose: it refused to roleplay as anyone but itself, and just kept saying ""I'm an AI, so I don't have feelings on the matter blablabla"" and similar. I had to go into the Playground and engineer a backlog chat history for it to actually start responding as a ""person"".

Or when I tried to make it analyse a Reddit profile, and it told me it would be unethical to do so. That's also when I realized it's been gimped to not say anything negative: I pasted all the comments from the first two pages of the profile (it was a shitshow, and all heavily downvoted). What did ChatGPT think? That the person posting was probably a highly intelligent and educated person. Why? Because they post about many different things, and they even include links! It seemed unwilling to do a negative take, even if that was the obvious answer.

I've tried making some over-the-top memeworthy pictures in Dalle-3. But again, content violation :( I was writing up a way WAY over the top image with the Danish Viking legend Holger Danske, the sky opening with the Danish flag, bunnies drinking tea on a Viking ship, and all around tomfoolery. But alas, when I said ""And Godzilla setting fire to Sweden in the background"" (Denmark and Sweden has a long rivalry, akin to that between siblings - we don't actually hate each other, but we like to make fun of each other), and boom, that was too much.

Or the time when I wanted a picture like in the Matrix with Trinity, and I found out that ""latex"" is an instant no-no word apparently. Once I replaced it with ""leather"" it was fine (but also just outputted people in leather jackets).

I also use it for coding, and while it can still output good code, it's much harder to actually make it write it now. I have to tell it, over several different messages, that it needs to output the entire code and not just relevant snippets - even then, it'll often just output the code snippet for me one more time.

I get why they're trying to do a lot of this stuff. It used to hallucinate a ton of info, and used to be very easy to trick into writing a loooooooot of shit it probably shouldn't. I get why they don't want Dalle-3 outputting porn (makes it hard with investors and credit card companies). But it's at the point where half the time it feels like it's lost the whole point that made it useful. Particularly no longer following user instructions is extremely frustrating, and a pretty big letdown.

Not sure if it's getting worse because the various updates is actually fucking too much with the output, or if the updates are just making it more clear how limited it always was, now that it doesn't output hallucinations and such as much anymore.

Also, I haven't seen anyone talk about the fact that it got updated with knowledge to January 2022? It used to be September 2021, but now it will consistently say it's last update was January 2022.

I know for a fact that he definitely read the book because him and I have been talking about it quite a bit, and I see him reading it all the time when we all go to bed for the evening. But for some reason, he decided to use ChatGPT to write a short summary of the book instead of just writing it on his own. He showed me the assignment where they were tasked to write a specific number of sentences and or paragraphs summarizing the book, and then proceeded to tell me that what he wrote was essentially 100% written by ChatGPT.

Of course, I immediately expressed my concern with the ethics of what he had done and asked him whether or not he thought that was an ethical way to use ChatGPT.  Honestly, I was pretty alarmed at how nonchalant he was about the whole thing. I kind of see his point of view in that he has read the entire book, can speak to the details of the story, and that he was basically just using ChatGPT to assemble thoughts and ideas that he has already kind of had floating around in his head already, but my stance is that at the end of the day, plagiarism is plagiarism, it’s not his original work, and it’s unethical, plain and simple. 

I feel like this issue is going to start popping up more and more with AI only becoming more advanced, and things like Microsoft CoPilot coming to market. Eventually, I feel like AI is going to be doing all of this kind of creative writing for us, so I’m curious as to what people think my approach should be here. Do I let him turn the assignment in and take care of it in-house, do I make him rewrite it and submit it late, or do I let him decide on his own knowing that he’s doing something unethical should he decide to turn it in? I almost feel like this is my fault since I am an IT professional who is the one that showed him how to use the tool in the first place. That being said, I have made it very clear that there is a difference between ethical use and unethical use of AI. Curious to hear opinions on this."

Hey everyone,

I recently started using ChatGPT, a language model based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, for my school work and personal projects. While I find the tool to be incredibly helpful and versatile, I also noticed that the pricing plan can be quite expensive, especially for students like me.

I reached out to the ChatGPT team and requested that they add a more affordable student plan to the pricing options. In my request, I suggested that the student plan should have a lower cost and a limited number of requests per day to meet the budget and needs of students.

I believe that this request would benefit many students who are looking for an AI language model that is both affordable and effective. Moreover, it would also benefit the ChatGPT company by attracting a larger customer base and promoting accessibility.

I am sharing this discussion on Reddit in the hopes that it would reach the ChatGPT team and encourage them to take my request into account. I am also interested in hearing your thoughts on the matter. What do you think about the current pricing plan for ChatGPT? Do you think a more affordable student plan would be helpful?

I don't think we should call the writing of prompts ""prompt engineering."" Why, you ask? Well, to me, the word ""engineering"" implies a lot of technical education and precision, which may not be entirely accurate when it comes to crafting prompts.

Instead, I suggest we start calling it ""prompt crafting."" This term better captures the creative aspect of writing prompts. 

Crafting a prompt is not just a technical process. It involves a deep understanding of language and machine psychology. Prompt crafters must also consider the intended use of the output and potential biases in the model.

Of course, some may argue that the term ""prompt engineering"" is still appropriate, as it conveys the idea that prompts are carefully constructed to achieve a specific outcome. However, I think that ""prompt crafting"" better reflects the process.

*(Not to mention, it doesn't sound as snooty, and it's less likely to get our heads dunked in toilets by marauding bands of actual engineers.  -- drekmonger)*

At the end of the day, it may seem like a small difference, but the way we talk about things can have a big impact on how we approach them. So, let's start referring to prompt writing as ""prompt crafting"" and celebrate the creativity and imagination that goes into it!"

- *There are no visible fractures or dislocations in the bony structures.*

***Abnormal Findings:***
- *The lumbar spine shows signs suggestive of a herniated disc, particularly at the L4-L5 level, which could compress the right sciatic nerve root, correlating with the described sciatica symptoms.*
- *Possible mild scoliosis with a slight right convexity is observed in the thoracic spine, which may be contributing to the pain in the upper back.*
- *The described ""popping"" sensation could indicate a dynamic component, such as movement of the herniated disc material or subluxation of a vertebral segment during certain motions.*

**Impression or Conclusion:**

***Summary of Key Findings:***
- *Suspected herniated disc at L4-L5 level with potential sciatic nerve root compression.*
- *Mild thoracic scoliosis with a right convexity.*

***Possible Diagnoses:***
- *Lumbar disc herniation with right-sided sciatica.*
- *Thoracic scoliosis with associated muscular pain, potentially more pronounced on the right side.*

***Level of Certainty:***
- *Moderate to high certainty for the lumbar disc herniation due to the correlation between the imaging findings and the clinical symptoms of sciatica.*
- *Mild certainty regarding the scoliosis, as it is a subtle finding and could be incidental.*

**Recommendations:**
- ***Further Testing:*** *An MRI of the lumbar spine would be beneficial to confirm the presence and extent of the herniated disc and nerve root compression. Additionally, it would provide more detail on soft tissue structures, which are not well-defined on the provided images.*
- ***Medical Management:*** *Conservative treatment for sciatica typically includes physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and pain management. In cases where conservative treatment fails, a surgical evaluation may be warranted.*

**Specific Concerns:**
*Given the nature of the symptoms and the intermittent relief with certain movements, it would be essential to address the patient's concerns regarding the unpredictability of pain episodes and the impact on daily life. Education about posture, back support during activities, and proper lifting techniques could also be beneficial to manage symptoms and prevent exacerbation. Further discussion about the potential need for lifestyle adjustments or interventions, depending on the progression of symptoms and response to initial treatments, would be prudent.*"

(EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY)

I  tricked GPT4 into analysing my spinal scans for entertainment and curiosity purposes, and it did quite well!

I’ve tweaked the hell out of my prompt since then and it’s even better, will be more specific, and not over exaggerate the data and even ask you follow up question to identify or narrow down areas of concern!

I’m still tweaking it, and will release it as a custom GPT via public link only as I’d feel it would just be reported by angry people, I guess?

It only gave me broad PC responses, and nothing on the latest findings, news, and research.  


Instead of just being truthful and state that its training set is dated, it was rather ""smug"" and kept shooting out AND REPEATING the same dry PC answers.  


For me, that makes ChatGPT less than useless. It is good for some things, but nothing the least bit controversial. And it still have a leftist bias, though it claims to be politically neutral.  


Not sure why there is so much hype over it. Just a glorified statistical inference engine, by it's own admission!"
