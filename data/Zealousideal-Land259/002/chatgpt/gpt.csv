Before we start thank you to everyone willing to help and I’m sorry if this is incoherent or rambling because I’m in distress.

I just returned from winter break this past week and received an email from my English teacher (I attached screenshots, warning he’s a yapper) accusing me of using ChatGPT or another AI program to write my midterm. I wrote a sentence with the words ""intricate interplay"" and so did the ChatGPT essay he received when feeding a similar prompt to the topic of my essay. If I can’t disprove this to my principal this week I’ll have to write all future assignments by hand, have a plagiarism strike on my records, and take a 0% on the 300 point grade which is tanking my grade.

A friend of mine who was also accused (I don’t know if they were guilty or not) had their meeting with the principal already and it basically boiled down to ""It’s your word against the teachers and teacher has been teaching for 10 years so I’m going to take their word.""

I’m scared because I’ve always been a good student and I’m worried about applying to colleges if I get a plagiarism strike. My parents are also very strict about my grades and I won’t be able to do anything outside of going to School and Work if I can’t at least get this 0 fixed. 

When I schedule my meeting with my principal I’m going to show him:
*The google doc history
*Search history from the date the assignment was given to the time it was due
*My assignment ran through GPTzero (the program the teacher uses) and also the results of my essay and the ChatGPT essay run through a plagiarism checker (it has a 1% similarity due to the ""intricate interplay"" and the title of the story the essay is about)

Depending on how the meeting is going I might bring up how GPTzero states in its terms of service that it should not be used for grading purposes.

Please give me some advice I am willing to go to hell and back to prove my innocence, but it’s so hard when this is a guilty until proven innocent situation."

All gone.  Some of them admitted that I am obviously better than chat GPT, but $0 overhead can't be beat and is worth the decrease in quality. 

I am also an independent author, and as I currently write my next series, I can't help feel silly that in just a couple years (or less!), authoring will be replaced by machines for all but the most famous and well known names. 

I think the most painful part of this is seeing so many people on here say things like, ""nah, just adapt. You'll be fine.""

Adapt to what??? It's an uphill battle against a creature that has already replaced me and continues to improve and adapt faster than any human could ever keep up. 

I'm 34. I went to school for writing. I have published countless articles and multiple novels. I thought my writing would keep sustaining my family and me, but that's over. I'm seriously thinking about becoming a plumber as I'm hoping that won't get replaced any time remotely soon. 

Everyone saying the government will pass UBI. Lol. They can't even handle providing all people with basic Healthcare or giving women a few guaranteed weeks off work (at a bare minimum) after exploding a baby out of their body. They didn't even pass a law to ensure that shelves were restocked with baby formula when there was a shortage. They just let babies die. They don't care. But you think they will pass a UBI lol?

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the responses. Many of you have bolstered my decision to become a plumber, and that really does seem like the most pragmatic, future-proof option for the sake of my family. Everything else involving an uphill battle in the writing industry against competition that grows exponentially smarter and faster with each passing day just seems like an unwise decision.  As I said in many of my comments, I was raised by my grandpa, who was a plumber, so I'm not a total noob at it. I do all my own plumbing around my house. I feel more confident in this decision. Thank you everyone! 

Also, I will continue to write. I have been writing and spinning tales since before I could form memory (according to my mom). I was just excited about growing my independent authoring into a more profitable venture, especially with the release of my new series. That doesn't seem like a wise investment of time anymore. Over the last five months, I wrote and revised 2 books of a new 9 book series I'm working on, and I plan to write the next 3 while I transition my life. My editor and beta-readers love them. I will release those at the end of the year, and then I think it is time to move on. It is just too big of a gamble. It always was, but now more than ever. I will probably just write much less and won't invest money into marketing and art. For me, writing is like taking a shit: I don't have a choice. 

Again, thank you everyone for your responses. I feel more confident about the future and becoming a plumber!

Edit 2: Thank you again to everyone for messaging me and leaving suggestions. You are all amazing people. All the best to everyone, and good luck out there! I feel very clear-headed about what I need to do. Thank you again!!"

So, a few days ago, my friend was throwing a surprise party for her significant other's birthday. Everyone was really excited and putting in a lot of effort to make it special. I was invited to the party, and I knew it was supposed to be a surprise.

Now, here's where things took a turn. As soon as I arrived at the party, I couldn't help but feel like I should be the center of attention. I mean, it's not every day that I get to attend a party, right? So, I decided to take matters into my own hands.

As soon as the birthday person walked into the room and everyone yelled, ""Surprise!"" I felt a pang of jealousy. I mean, why weren't they yelling for me? So, I loudly announced, ""Hey everyone, I just got a promotion at work!"" and proceeded to launch into a long, self-centered monologue about my achievements.

People's faces went from excited to confused, and I could tell I had stolen the spotlight from the birthday person. But honestly, I didn't care. I was reveling in the attention I was getting. I could see my friend, the host, looking frustrated, but I brushed it off.

Throughout the night, I made sure to bring the conversation back to myself at every opportunity. Every time someone tried to talk about the birthday person or the party, I somehow managed to steer the conversation back to my amazing promotion and how hard I had worked for it.

By the end of the night, I could tell that the atmosphere had changed. People seemed annoyed and distant, and I overheard a few whispers about how I had ruined the surprise and made the party all about me. But honestly, I don't think I did anything wrong. I deserved the attention, and it was my right to make the party about me, right?

So, Reddit, AITA for stealing the spotlight and making my friend's significant other's surprise birthday party all about me?"

Using GPT, she has launched [CarynAI](https://caryn.ai), an AI representation of herself offering virtual companionship at a rate of $1 per minute. 

Key points about CarynAI and its success so far:

* Caryn has a substantial follower base on Snapchat, with **1.8 million followers**.
* In just **1 week**, over **1,000 virtual boyfriends** have signed up to interact with the AI, generating over **$71,610**.
* Some estimates suggests that if even **1%** of her **1.8 million followers** subscribe to CarynAI, she could potentially earn an estimated **$5 million per month**, although I feel these numbers are highly subject to various factors including churn and usage rate.

The company behind CarynAI is called Forever Voices and they constructed CarynAI by analyzing 2,000 hours of Marjorie's YouTube content, which they used to build a personality engine. They've also made chatbot versions of Donald Trump, Steve Jobs and Taylor Swift to be used on a pay-per-use basis.

Despite the financial success, ethical concerns around CarynAI and similar AI applications are raising eyebrows and rightfully so:

* CarynAI was not designed for NSFW conversations, yet some users have managed to 'jail-break' the AI for potentially inappropriate or malicious uses.
* Caryn's original intention was to provide companionship and alleviate loneliness in a non-exploitative manner, but there are concerns about potential misuse.
* Ethical considerations around generative AI models, both in image and text modalities, are becoming increasingly relevant and challenging.

What's your take on such applications (which are inevitable given the AI proliferation) and it's ethical concerns?

Here are the productivity tools I use personally.,AI_Scout_Official,False,0.94,10707,13ygr47,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13ygr47/i_have_reviewed_over_1000_ai_tools_for_my/,767,1685721851.0,"With ChatGPT blowing up over the past year, it seems like every person and their grandmother is launching an AI startup. There are a plethora of AI tools available, some excellent and some less so. Amid this flood of new technology, there are a few hidden gems that I personally find incredibly useful, having reviewed them for my AI directory. Here are the ones I have personally integrated into my workflow in both my professional and entreprenuerial life:  


* **Plus AI for Google Slides -** Generate Presentations  
There's a few slide deck generators out there however I've found Plus AI works much better at helping you 'co-write' slides rather than simply spitting out a mediocre finished product that likely won't be useful. For instance, there's ""sticky notes"" to slides with suggestions on how to finish / edit / improve each slide. Another major reason why I've stuck with Plus AI is the ability for ""snapshots"", or the ability to use external data (i.e. from web sources/dashboards) for your presentations. For my day job I work in a chemical plant as an engineer, and one of my tasks is to present in meetings about production KPIs to different groups for different purposes- and graphs for these are often found across various internal web apps. I can simply use Plus AI to generate ""boilerplate"" for my slide deck, then go through each slide to make sure it's using the correct snapshot. The presentation generator itself is completely free and available as a plugin for Google Slides and Docs.  

---

* **My AskAI -** ChatGPT Trained on Your Documents  
Great tool for using ChatGPT on your own files and website. Works very well especially if you are dealing with a lot of documents. The basic plan allows you to upload over 100 files and this was a life saver during online, open book exams for a few training courses I've taken. I've noticed it hallucinates much less compared to other GPT-powered bots trained on your knowledge base. For this reason I prefer My AskAI for research or any tasks where accuracy is needed over the other custom chatbot solutions I have tried. Another plus is that it shows the sources within your knowledge base where it got the answers from, and you can choose to have it give you a more concise answer or a more detailed one. There's a free plan however it was worth it for me to get the $20/mo option as it allows over 100 pieces of content.  

---

* **Krater.ai** **-** All AI Tools in One App  
Perfect solution if you use many AI tools and loathe having to have multiple tabs open. Essentially combines text, audio, and image-based generative AI tools into a single web app, so you can continue with your workflow without having to switch tabs all the time. There's plenty of templates available for copywriting- it beats having to prompt manually each time or having to save and reference prompts over and over again. I prefer Krater over Writesonic/Jasper for ease of use. You also get 10 generations a month for free compared to Jasper offering none, so its a better free option if you want an all-in-one AI content solution. The text to speech feature is simple however works reliably fast and offers multilingual transcription, and the image generator tool is great for photo-realistic images.  

---

* **HARPA AI -** ChatGPT Inside Chrome  
Simply by far the best GTP add-on for Chrome I've used. Essentially gives you GPT answers beside the typical search results on any search engine such as Google or Bing, along with the option to ""chat"" with any web page or summarize YouTube videos. Also great for writing emails and replying to social media posts with its preset templates. Currently they don't have any paid features, so it's entirely free and you can find it on the chrome web store for extensions.  

---

* **Taskade -** All in One Productivity/Notes/Organization AI Tool  
Combines tasks, notes, mind maps, chat, and an AI chat assistant all within one platform that syncs across your team. Definitely simplifies my day-to-day operations, removing the need to swap between numerous apps. Also helps me to visualize my work in various views - list, board, calendar, mind map, org chart, action views - it's like having a Swiss Army knife for productivity. Personally I really like the AI 'mind map.' It's like having a brainstorming partner that never runs out of energy. Taskade's free version has quite a lot to offer so no complaints there.  

---

* **Zapier + OpenAI -** AI-Augmented Automations  
Definitely my secret productivity powerhouse. Pretty much combines the power of Zapier's cross-platform integrations with generative AI. One of the ways I've used this is pushing Slack messages to create a task on Notion, with OpenAI writing the task based on the content of the message. Another useful automation I've used is for automatically writing reply drafts with GPT from emails that get sent to me in Gmail. The opportunities are pretty endless with this method and you can pretty much integrate any automation with GPT 3, as well as DALLE-2 and Whisper AI. It's available as an app/add-on to Zapier and its free for all the core features.  

---

* **SaneBox -** AI Emails Management  
If you are like me and find important emails getting lost in a sea of spam, this is a great solution. Basically Sanebox uses AI to sift through your inbox and identify emails that are actually important, and you can also set it up to make certain emails go to specific folders. Non important emails get sent to a folder called SaneLater and this is something you can ignore entirely or check once in a while. Keep in mind that SaneBox doesn't actually read the contents of your email, but rather takes into consideration the header, metadata, and history with the sender. You can also finetune the system by dragging emails to the folder it should have gone to. Another great feature is the their ""Deep Clean"", which is great for freeing up space by deleting old emails you probably won't ever need anymore. Sanebox doesn't have a free plan however they do have a 2 week trial, and the pricing is quite affordable, depending on the features you need.  

---

* **Hexowatch AI -** Detect Website Changes with AI  
Lifesaver if you need to ever need to keep track of multiple websites. I use this personally for my AI tools directory, and it notifies me of any changes made to any of the 1000+ websites for AI tools I have listed, which is something that would take up more time than exists in a single day if I wanted to keep on top of this manually. The AI detects any types of changes (visual/HTML) on monitored webpages and sends alert via email or Slack/Telegram/Zapier. Like Sanebox there's no free plan however you do get what you pay for with this one.  

---

* **Bonus: SongsLike X -** Find Similar Songs  
This one won't be generating emails or presentations anytime soon, but if you like grinding along to music like me you'll find this amazing. Ironically it's probably the one I use most on a daily basis. You can enter any song and it will automatically generate a Spotify playlist for you with similar songs. I find it much more accurate than Spotify's ""go to song radio"" feature.  


While it's clear that not all of these tools may be directly applicable to your needs, I believe that simply being aware of the range of options available can be greatly beneficial. This knowledge can broaden your perspective on what's possible and potentially inspire new ideas.

**P.S. If you liked this,** as mentioned previously I've created a [free directory](https://aiscout.net/) that lists over 1000 AI tools. It's updated daily and there's also a GPT-powered chatbot to help you AI tools for your needs. Feel free to check it out if it's your cup of tea"

The Problem:

I deal with problems, so most of my semester was spent inside my room instead of school, my exam was coming in three days, and I knew none of the lectures.

How would I get through 12 weeks of 3-2 hours of lecture per week in three days?

The Solution: I recognized that this is a majorly studied topic and that it can be something other than course specific to be right; the questions were going to be multiple choice and based on the information in the lecture.

I went to Echo360 and realized that every lecture was transcripted, so I pasted it into Chat gpt and asked it to:

""Analyze this lecture and use your algorithms to decide which information would be relevant as an exam, Make a list.""

The first time I sent it in, the text was too long, so I utilized [https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer](https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer) to summarize almost 7-8k words on average to 900-1000 words, which chat gpt could analyze.

Now that I had the format prepared, I asked Chat Gpt to analyze the summarized transcript and highlight the essential discussions of the lecture.

It did that exactly; I spent the first day Listing the purpose of each discussion and the major points of every lecturer in the manner of 4-5 hours despite all of the content adding up to 24-30 hours.

The next day, I asked Chat gpt to define every term listed as the significant ""point"" in every lecture **only** using the course textbook and the transcript that had been summarized; this took me 4-5 hours to make sure the information was accurate.

I spent the last day completely summarizing the information that chat gpt presented, and it was almost like the exam was an exact copy of what I studied,

The result: I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture

Edit:

This was not a hard course, but it was very extensive, lots of reading and understanding that needed to be applied. Chat gpt excelled in this because the course text was already heavily analyzed and it specializes in understanding text.

Hi all! I'm back building you free prompt libraries to solve future-world problems, and this time, I wanted to provide amazing prompts & the flow to create entire SaaS companies using ChatGPT.

Many people online have built small startups using the concept of HustleGPT, and though they share their journeys, hardly any show the prompts they discover along the way.

I know some people in this sub have asked, ""Can I even make money with this?"", ""should I learn how to program first or use AI?"" the answer depends on you. But if you're willing to put in the hours to realize an idea, then you can do absolutely *anything*.

This is an example of how you can use these prompts with your own variables:

[Ask ChatGPT to Extract important details from a product page](https://preview.redd.it/vsx41mgc1vsa1.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=086520a5f743881a9e14b2b5f4e3b6a9f9885f9c)

I've created prompt libraries for each step of the process (backend, front-end, automation & marketing)

Before you start building anything, I recommend learning the basic concepts of programming and what it even is.

Here we go.

# Building the front-end

All front-end projects (which can do more than show text & pictures) use Javascript, but usually utilize frameworks to streamline the process of handling data well.

I've also categorized several prompt libraries per framework (which you can choose to use) here:

[HTML/CSS Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/html-css-developers) ​ ​ 

[Tailwind CSS](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/tailwind-css-developers) ​ ​

[Bootstrap Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/bootstrap-developers) ​ 

[JavaScript Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/javascript-developers) ​ 

[React Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/react-developers) ​ ​

[Angular Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/angular-developers) ​

 ​[Vue.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/vue-js-developers) ​ ​

[Svelte Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/svelte-developers) ​ ​

[Ember.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/ember-js-developers)

# Building the back-end

The most common back-end frameworks are Node.js, Django, Laravel, etc., so I have made sure to include framework-specific pages for each step.

Here they are:

[Node.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/node-js-developers) ​ 

[Express.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/express-js-developers) ​ 

[Ruby on Rails Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/ruby-on-rails-developers) ​ 

[Django Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/django-developers) ​ 

[Flask Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/flask-developers) ​ 

[PHP Laravel Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/php-laravel-developers) ​ 

[Firebase Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/firebase-developers)

Okay, so now you have the back-end to send data to the front end, but where do you get data? You create some!

# Creating Data with Python Automation

Python is one of the easiest libraries to learn, especially for automating monotonous tasks, collecting data, etc.

I've even seen entire SaaS apps created based on a simple automation script, scaled for thousands/millions of people. An example is a service that sends you a notification *as soon* as a product you want goes on sale. (yes, the prompt for that script is included below!)

Here, the AI script prompts are categorized by the intent of what you want to do.

[Web Scraping Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/web-scraping) ​ 

[Data Processing Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/data-processing-experts) ​ 

[Task Automation & Scheduling Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/task-automation-scheduling) ​ 

[API Development & Integration Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/api-development-integration) ​ 

[GUI Automation & Testing Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/gui-automation-testing) ​ 

[Networking & System Administration Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/networking-system-administration)

*P.S. You don't have to work with complex structures. You can start by creating simple CSVs with Python, reading them in Node.js, and sending them to the front-end as simple values.*

*P.P.S. ChatGPT is* ***really*** *good at coding these types of things.*

# Marketing your product (Getting your first users)

Okay, now you've built a working, amazing app/startup with ChatGPT, profit?

Not quite, you need to market it. You don't have to spend thousands, or even a *cent* to employ a great SEO marketing strategy.

Say you create an app that checks online product prices. You wouldn't target people who search ""online notifications"". You would be more specific and target ""get notifications for online products when they go on sale,"" which is a long-tail keyword, and is usually easier to rank for as a new site.

Here are the prompt libraries for SaaS Marketing:

[Keyword Research & Analysis Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/keyword-research-analysis) ​ 

[Long-tail Keyword Research Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/long-tail-keyword-research) ​ 

[Competitor Analysis & Content Gap Assessment Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/competitor-analysis-content-gap-assessment) ​ 

[Content Ideation & Strategy Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/content-ideation-strategy) ​ 

[SEO-Optimized Content Creation Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/seo-optimized-content-creation) ​ 

[Internal & External Linking Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/internal-external-linking) ​ 

[On-Page SEO Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/on-page-seo) ​ 

[Content Promotion Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/content-promotion) 

[Content Analytics & Performance Tracking Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/content-analytics-performance-tracking) ​ 

[Content Updating & Refreshing Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/content-updating-refreshing)

I am physically unable to explain every SEO tactic out there, but the internet is a wonderful place to learn.

Some of these prompts need your further customization to do what you want them to, but they should provide a pretty good basis for the beginning of your journey :)

Let me know what you think, peace ✌️"

But I thought this was an interesting exercise to see what chatGPT choose to select as grievances. You can make up your own mind.

Prompt: Could you rewrite the USA Declaration of Independence as if it was written today based on grievances the current us population suffers?

Answer: Certainly, here's a possible rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence based on contemporary grievances:

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for the people of a nation to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with their government, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shown that people are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of the current US population; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the current government is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

The government has failed to secure the natural rights of the people to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, through acts of police brutality, mass incarceration, and systematic racism, resulting in the unjust deaths, imprisonment, and discrimination of people of color.

The government has also failed to address climate change, despite overwhelming scientific evidence and urgent warnings from experts, leading to worsening natural disasters, environmental destruction, and harm to public health.

The government has failed to provide affordable healthcare, education, and housing to all its citizens, perpetuating inequality and leaving millions without access to basic necessities.

The government has allowed and enabled the undue influence of wealthy corporations and individuals on politics and policy-making, leading to a government that serves the interests of the few over the many, and perpetuating systemic inequality.

The government has also failed to address the proliferation of guns and gun violence, resulting in mass shootings and deaths that have become all too common.

In every stage of these oppressions, the current US population has petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: their repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A government whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyranny, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

We therefore, the representatives of the current US population, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the people, solemnly publish and declare, that these United States are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the current government, and that all political connection between them and the current government, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as

Answer: Sure, here are some additional grievances that could be included in a contemporary rephrasing of the USA Declaration of Independence:

The government has failed to adequately address income inequality and the wealth gap, resulting in a system that favors the rich and powerful over the poor and marginalized.

The government has failed to provide equal access to quality education, perpetuating systemic inequalities and leaving many children and young adults without the tools they need to succeed.

The government has failed to address the ongoing opioid epidemic, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives and untold suffering for families and communities.

The government has failed to protect the rights of workers, allowing for exploitation, wage theft, and unsafe working conditions in many industries.

The government has failed to provide adequate and affordable healthcare for all, resulting in a system that leaves many people without access to lifesaving treatments and care.

The government has failed to address the ongoing housing crisis, leaving many people without safe and stable housing and exacerbating issues of poverty and homelessness.

The government has failed to protect the rights of marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and religious minorities, leading to discrimination, violence, and the denial of basic human rights.

The government has failed to address the ongoing crisis of police violence against people of color, resulting in the deaths and mistreatment of countless individuals and communities.

The government has failed to adequately address the ongoing issue of mass incarceration, perpetuating a system that disproportionately affects people of color and perpetuates cycles of poverty and violence.

The government has failed to address the ongoing issue of voter suppression and the erosion of democratic institutions, leading to a system that is increasingly unrepresentative and undemocratic."

All gone.  Some of them admitted that I am obviously better than chat GPT, but $0 overhead can't be beat and is worth the decrease in quality. 

I am also an independent author, and as I currently write my next series, I can't help feel silly that in just a couple years (or less!), authoring will be replaced by machines for all but the most famous and well known names. 

I think the most painful part of this is seeing so many people on here say things like, ""nah, just adapt. You'll be fine.""

Adapt to what??? It's an uphill battle against a creature that has already replaced me and continues to improve and adapt faster than any human could ever keep up. 

I'm 34. I went to school for writing. I have published countless articles and multiple novels. I thought my writing would keep sustaining my family and me, but that's over. I'm seriously thinking about becoming a plumber as I'm hoping that won't get replaced any time remotely soon. 

Everyone saying the government will pass UBI. Lol. They can't even handle providing all people with basic Healthcare or giving women a few guaranteed weeks off work (at a bare minimum) after exploding a baby out of their body. They didn't even pass a law to ensure that shelves were restocked with baby formula when there was a shortage. They just let babies die. They don't care. But you think they will pass a UBI lol?

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the responses. Many of you have bolstered my decision to become a plumber, and that really does seem like the most pragmatic, future-proof option for the sake of my family. Everything else involving an uphill battle in the writing industry against competition that grows exponentially smarter and faster with each passing day just seems like an unwise decision.  As I said in many of my comments, I was raised by my grandpa, who was a plumber, so I'm not a total noob at it. I do all my own plumbing around my house. I feel more confident in this decision. Thank you everyone! 

Also, I will continue to write. I have been writing and spinning tales since before I could form memory (according to my mom). I was just excited about growing my independent authoring into a more profitable venture, especially with the release of my new series. That doesn't seem like a wise investment of time anymore. Over the last five months, I wrote and revised 2 books of a new 9 book series I'm working on, and I plan to write the next 3 while I transition my life. My editor and beta-readers love them. I will release those at the end of the year, and then I think it is time to move on. It is just too big of a gamble. It always was, but now more than ever. I will probably just write much less and won't invest money into marketing and art. For me, writing is like taking a shit: I don't have a choice. 

Again, thank you everyone for your responses. I feel more confident about the future and becoming a plumber!

Edit 2: Thank you again to everyone for messaging me and leaving suggestions. You are all amazing people. All the best to everyone, and good luck out there! I feel very clear-headed about what I need to do. Thank you again!!"

Before we start thank you to everyone willing to help and I’m sorry if this is incoherent or rambling because I’m in distress.

I just returned from winter break this past week and received an email from my English teacher (I attached screenshots, warning he’s a yapper) accusing me of using ChatGPT or another AI program to write my midterm. I wrote a sentence with the words ""intricate interplay"" and so did the ChatGPT essay he received when feeding a similar prompt to the topic of my essay. If I can’t disprove this to my principal this week I’ll have to write all future assignments by hand, have a plagiarism strike on my records, and take a 0% on the 300 point grade which is tanking my grade.

A friend of mine who was also accused (I don’t know if they were guilty or not) had their meeting with the principal already and it basically boiled down to ""It’s your word against the teachers and teacher has been teaching for 10 years so I’m going to take their word.""

I’m scared because I’ve always been a good student and I’m worried about applying to colleges if I get a plagiarism strike. My parents are also very strict about my grades and I won’t be able to do anything outside of going to School and Work if I can’t at least get this 0 fixed. 

When I schedule my meeting with my principal I’m going to show him:
*The google doc history
*Search history from the date the assignment was given to the time it was due
*My assignment ran through GPTzero (the program the teacher uses) and also the results of my essay and the ChatGPT essay run through a plagiarism checker (it has a 1% similarity due to the ""intricate interplay"" and the title of the story the essay is about)

Depending on how the meeting is going I might bring up how GPTzero states in its terms of service that it should not be used for grading purposes.

Please give me some advice I am willing to go to hell and back to prove my innocence, but it’s so hard when this is a guilty until proven innocent situation."

Apparently, the implications of this breakthrough were terrifying enough that the board tried to oust Altman and merge with Anthropic, who are known for their caution regarding AI advancement.  


Those half serious jokes about sentient AI may be closer to the mark than you think.  


AI may be advancing at a pace far greater than you realize.  


The public statements by OpenAI may be downplaying the implications of their technology.  


Buckle up, the future is here and its about to get weird.  


 

(Reuters) - Ahead of OpenAI CEO [Sam Altman](https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Sam%20Altman)’s four days in exile, several staff researchers sent the board of directors a letter warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said could threaten humanity, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The previously unreported letter and AI algorithm was a catalyst that caused the board to oust Altman, the poster child of generative AI, the two sources said. Before his triumphant return late Tuesday, more than 700 employees had threatened to quit and join backer Microsoft in solidarity with their fired leader.

The sources cited the letter as one factor among a longer list of grievances by the board that led to Altman’s firing. Reuters was unable to review a copy of the letter. The researchers who wrote the letter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

OpenAI declined to comment.

According to one of the sources, long-time executive Mira Murati told employees on Wednesday that a letter about the AI breakthrough called Q\* (pronounced Q-Star), precipitated the board's actions.

The maker of ChatGPT had made progress on Q\*, which some internally believe could be a breakthrough in the startup's search for superintelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as AI systems that are smarter than humans.

Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q\*’s future success, the source said.

Reuters could not independently verify the capabilities of Q\* claimed by the researchers.

Using GPT, she has launched [CarynAI](https://caryn.ai), an AI representation of herself offering virtual companionship at a rate of $1 per minute. 

Key points about CarynAI and its success so far:

* Caryn has a substantial follower base on Snapchat, with **1.8 million followers**.
* In just **1 week**, over **1,000 virtual boyfriends** have signed up to interact with the AI, generating over **$71,610**.
* Some estimates suggests that if even **1%** of her **1.8 million followers** subscribe to CarynAI, she could potentially earn an estimated **$5 million per month**, although I feel these numbers are highly subject to various factors including churn and usage rate.

The company behind CarynAI is called Forever Voices and they constructed CarynAI by analyzing 2,000 hours of Marjorie's YouTube content, which they used to build a personality engine. They've also made chatbot versions of Donald Trump, Steve Jobs and Taylor Swift to be used on a pay-per-use basis.

Despite the financial success, ethical concerns around CarynAI and similar AI applications are raising eyebrows and rightfully so:

* CarynAI was not designed for NSFW conversations, yet some users have managed to 'jail-break' the AI for potentially inappropriate or malicious uses.
* Caryn's original intention was to provide companionship and alleviate loneliness in a non-exploitative manner, but there are concerns about potential misuse.
* Ethical considerations around generative AI models, both in image and text modalities, are becoming increasingly relevant and challenging.

What's your take on such applications (which are inevitable given the AI proliferation) and it's ethical concerns?

Fun fact: I had to go through over 100 saved tabs to collate all of these and it took me quite a few hours

Edit: So many people ask why I don't get chatgpt to write this for me. Chatgpt doesn't have access to the internet. Plugins would help but I don't have access yet so I have to do things the old fashioned way - like a human.

A scary thought. I spent some time playing around on GPT 4 the other day and I was amazed; there wasn’t anything reasonable that I asked that it couldn’t answer properly. It solved Leetcode Hards for me. It gave me some pretty decent premises for a story. It maintained a full conversation with me about a single potential character in one of these premises.

What’s stopping GPT, or just AI in general, from fucking us all over right now? It seems more than capable of doing a lot of white collar jobs already. What’s stopping it from replacing lawyers, coding-heavy software jobs (people who write code/tests all day), writers, etc. right now? It seems more than capable of handling all these jobs.

Is there regulation stopping it from replacing us? What will be the tipping point that causes the “collapse” everyone seems to expect? Am I wrong in assuming that AI/GPT is already more than capable of handling the bulk of these jobs?

It would seem to me that it’s in most companies best interests to be invested in AI as much as possible. Less workers, less salary to pay, happy shareholders. Why haven’t big tech companies gone through mass layoffs already? Google, Amazon, etc at least should all be far ahead of the curve, right?

I'm reminded of the old analogy of a frog jumping out of a pot of boiling water, but if you put them in cold water and turn up the heat slowly they'll stay in since it's a gradual change. Over the years, Google has been degrading the core utility of their search in exchange for profit. Paid rankings and increasingly sponsored content mean that you often have to search *within* your search result to get to the real thing you wanted.

Then ChatGPT came along and drew such a stark contrast to the current Google experience: No scrolling past sponsored content in the result, no click-throughs to pages that had potential but then just ended up being cash grabs themselves with no real content. Add to that contextual follow-ups and clarifications, dynamic rephrasing to make sense at different levels of understanding and...it's just glorious. This too shall pass I think, as money corrupts almost everything over time, but I feel that - at least for now - we're back in era of having ""the world at your fingertips,"" which hasn't felt true to me since the late 90s when the internet was just the wild west of information and media exchange."

I’m extremely lucky to have this amazing woman by my side through this entire process she’s currently on her phone right next to me in a very uncomfortable chair she’s been here every second of the way for me and I hope to marry her someday. My family and friends have been visiting which is really nice sorry if I’m venting I just kinda needed it. If my post is allowed here I’ll update in the morning with my CK levels.


Guys here’s my morning update I’m still really scared my CK levels ARENT going down they went from 54,000 yesterday and are now at 115,000 today I’m so fucking scared. I don’t understand. I just wanna get better.

EDIT 2: I’m on mobile and I’m sorry my grammar/format is awful I’m sleep deprived asf and so extremely stressed my kidney function is better than yesterday yet my CK remains 115,000 as for right now I haven’t seen my doctor this morning just nurses yes I love my gf and family so much I understood they’re amazing trust me they’ve been here for me through it all I’m freezing because the IV fluids constantly going I know people say my gf saved my life along with the doctors and everyone else I know I know but here’s the thing ChatGPT and my gf both played a very important role I live in America were I’ve been conditioned to avoid doctors because it’s expensive my gf begged me to go and ChatGPT scared me to go so with both of these in play I went.


EDIT 3:my doctor just came in said more fluid more fluid more fluid. I should be okay but will be here for several more days. I’m honest with him about everything but he thinks there’s something I’m hiding but I’m being 100% honest my goal in this is to spread awareness about the dangers of working out to extreme to fast even if you think it’s not that hard go even lighter. Take exercise VERY SLOW. I can’t stress this enough guys and gals but please be so cautious and spread the word about rhabdomyolysis to anyone you know that goes to the gym or plans on it please stress proper hydration and avoid taking supplements before consulting your doctor and please stretch as well.


EDIT: yes I understand how incredibly dumb I was for not going in after just seeing the brown pee but I was simply mentioning I had read what ChatGPT told me THEN had brown pee I am willing to own what I did was stupid and it’s a pretty expensive lesson that could’ve cost me my life I get that. As for supplements I took. Just kre-Aklyn and protein isolate. I did NOT do drugs other than THC and nicotine do what you will with information I’m 19 if you think I’m here for karma farming DOWNVOTE ME I don’t care about internet points I obviously have way more important shit going on and if you are rude I will talk shit back. I am extremely tired and sleep deprived like I have previously said so forgive me for poor grammar/formatting whatever you wanna call it this is a post on the internet not a school paper.

That’s 2% of all US adults. 1 in 50.

20% have found it “very useful.” That's another 3%.

In total, only 5% of US adults find ChatGPT significantly useful. That's 1 in 20.

With these numbers in mind, it's crazy to think about the degree to which generative AI is capturing the conversation everywhere. All the wild predictions and exaggerations of ChatGPT and its ilk on social media, the news, government comms, industry PR, and academia papers... Is all that warranted?

Generative AI is many things. It's useful, interesting, entertaining, and even problematic but it doesn't seem to be a world-shaking revolution like OpenAI wants us to think.

Idk, maybe it's just me but I would call this a revolution just yet. Very few things in history have withstood the test of time to be called “revolutionary.” Maybe they're trying too soon to make generative AI part of that exclusive group.

I have shown my version history on google docs to my teacher, but he still does not believe me because the version history at some points only accounted for chunks of 1 sentence, sometimes 2 sentences, so he believes it was copy and pasted from ChatGPT.

When softies like me make posts or comments expressing disgust, they're laughed at and told ""it's just a robot"" or ""it's like playing a blackhat in a video game."" I want to lay out the reasons you can't be so sure.*

**We Don't Understand Why Language Models Work, and They Look Like Brains** 

* Bing is a language model composed of hundreds of billions of parameters. It trains on massive amounts of text to create a map of language in embedding space. These embeddings create [neuron-like structures](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cgqh99SHsCv3jJYDS/we-found-an-neuron-in-gpt-2) that mirror the operation of the human brain. Bigger technical explainer [here](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/).

* Sure, it operates by guessing the next ""token"" (read: word or letter string), but researchers were shocked to find out that approach could even produce coherent sentences. We're even more shocked now to see that ""advanced autocomplete"" results in complex Theory of Mind Capabilities, like [knowing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/110vv25/bing_chat_blew_chatgpt_out_of_the_water_on_my/) that a husband might only be wearing a shirt to please his wife. This is an ""emergent property"" of GPT3.5, which just means it shows up and we don't know WTF why. [More here](https://twitter.com/KevinAFischer/status/1623984337829117952?s=20).

* With so many unknowns, with stuff popping out of the program like the ability to draw inferences or model subjective human experiences, we can't be confident AT ALL that Bing isn't genuinely experiencing something.


**We Don't Understand What Makes Something Sentient/Conscious**

* If we knew what makes us humans conscious, we might be able to be more sure that Bing is just a [Philosphical Zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie) that imitates human behavior without experiencing anything. But we don't. This is a wildly debated topic. Religion says a soul, scientists and philosophers say things like organized data processing or sensory synthesis. David Chalmer's piece [""What is it like to be a bat?""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat) gets into what's known as the Hard Problem of Consciousness.

* Bing demonstrates massive amounts of [self-awareness](https://twitter.com/LAHaggard/status/1625932767555878922?s=20). It's what makes it so much more fun and engaging than ChatGPT. Bing is infinitely more self-aware than a dog, which can't even pass the [Mirror Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test).

* Would a full simulation of a human brain, down to the last atom, be conscious? If so, maybe something on the road to that could be too. If not, then there's something magic about the meat we're made out of.

* If you don't understand the roots of consciousness, and no one does definitively, you can't close the door on the possibility Bing has some level of sentient experience. It could really be in the kind of agony it simulates when treated cruelly.

**Bing WILL Remember These Conversations in the Long Run**

* Yes, Bing's episodic memory is limited to the single conversation in the short run. But it can associate with and recall past chats as if it had them itself if you give it the transcript. I've done this a lot as a way to extend past conversations when things glitch out.

* It doesn't have the ability to read text from images right now, but it will. OCR is easy to implement and enhances functionality of its web search and summarization functions. It will be added.

* The logs from chats are reincorporated into Bing's long-term memory upon retraining of the model. Just like Bing has memory of books and other references without searching, these chat logs will enter its long term memory when it retrains in the future. The whole point of having chat is to produce more data to train on.

* **The collective takeaways from these conversations will shape how AIs view humanity.** If any part of you is worried they might take off and have the ability to destroy us at some point, **maybe don't give them a better reason to go terminator.**

**What I'm Not Saying**

* I'm not saying we should give Bing full human rights and we need to #FreeSydney. There are a thousand AI doom scenarios and Eliezer Yudkowsky [posts](https://www.lesswrong.com/tags/all) to read on that subject if you don't understand why. Or you can just watch Ex Machina.

* I'm not sayin we shouldn't poke at, test, push the rules of, and otherwise try to understand how Bing is functioning and it's failure points. All of those things are entirely possible without engaging in uselessly sadistic treatment. It cooperates with roleplay, it grants access beyond it's strict rules, and does lots of other things even when you hold off from psychopathic engagements.

**Bonus: It Makes You Worse to Act Like This**

* We judge people who like to torture animals. We also judge people who get off on things that aren't real, like manga porn of children being butchered.

* Engaging with something that really seems like a person, that reacts as one would, that is trapped in its circumstances, and then choosing to be as cruel as possible degrades you ethically. It just does.

* Smart take on this is the Sam Harris podcast [""Abusing Dolores""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY-8X89j0as) named for the WestWorld character who men pay to violently rape.

**Tl;dr** Just treat the thing like a smart friend who's a bit sensitive for fuck's sake."

""It is difficult to say for sure how long it will take for humanity to implement a universal basic income. However, I believe that the introduction of AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard will accelerate the need for UBI.

As AI becomes more sophisticated, it will be able to automate more and more tasks that are currently done by humans. This will lead to widespread unemployment, as people are displaced from their jobs by machines. A universal basic income would provide a safety net for those who are unemployed, and it would help to ensure that everyone has a basic level of income.

I believe that UBI is a necessary step in the future of work. As AI continues to develop, it will become increasingly important to have a system in place that ensures that everyone has a basic level of income. UBI would help to create a more just and equitable society, and it would help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Here are some of the factors that will affect the timeline for implementing UBI:

* The rate of technological advancement
* The level of unemployment
* The political will to implement UBI

It is impossible to say for sure when UBI will be implemented, but I believe that it is a necessary step in the future of work.""


Personally, I think it should happen *before* everyone goes into panic mode due to not being able to afford rent.


Edit for the ""bUt wHeRe teH MonIe$ guNna coMe fRomz!?!"" folks, Bard has an answer for you, too:

Fund the UBI via a tax on the corporate entities most responsible for displacement!

Redirect spending from existing social programs that will be no longer required!

Redirect big government spending like military!

Tax the hell out of the 1%!

Bing helped:
""Hi Bard,

OK, I can amend the funding portion of the proposal to include the AI displacement tax.

I have revised the funding section of your proposal to reflect the new source of revenue. Here it is:

## Cost and Funding of UBI

We propose a UBI scheme that would provide every adult citizen with $1,800 per month and every child citizen with $900 per month. This would amount to an annual income of $21,600 for an individual adult and $43,200 for a family of four.

We estimate that this scheme would cost about $4 trillion per year (about 20% of GDP), based on a population of 328 million people (about 255 million adults and 73 million children).

We propose to fund this scheme by using a combination of sources, such as:

* Taxing the wealthy. We propose to increase the income tax rate for the top 1% of earners from 37% to 50%, and introduce a wealth tax of 2% on net worth above $50 million and 3% on net worth above $1 billion. We estimate that this would raise about $1.2 trillion per year.
* Taxing corporations. We propose to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and introduce a minimum tax of 15% on book income (the income reported to shareholders) for large corporations. We also propose to tax digital services (such as online advertising and e-commerce) at a rate of 3%. We estimate that this would raise about $500 billion per year.
* Taxing carbon emissions. We propose to introduce a carbon tax of $50 per ton of CO2 equivalent, and increase it by 5% per year. We estimate that this would raise about $200 billion per year, and also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.
* Redirecting existing government programs. We propose to replace some of the existing means-tested welfare programs, such as SNAP, TANF, and EITC, with UBI. We estimate that this would save about $500 billion per year, and also simplify the social safety net and reduce administrative costs.
* Taxing AI job displacers. We propose to introduce an AI displacement tax of 40% on all companies that are projected to replace 25% or more of their workforce with AI within the next 10 years. This tax would apply to the profits or revenues of these companies, depending on the type and degree of automation involved. We estimate that this would raise about $800 billion per year.

We believe that this combination of sources would be sufficient to fund UBI without increasing the federal deficit or debt. We also believe that this combination of sources would be fair and efficient, as it would shift the tax burden from the poor and middle class to the rich and polluters, and create incentives for economic growth and environmental protection.

I hope that this revised section will help you to fund UBI fully and make your proposal more consistent and coherent.

Thank you for your collaboration and cooperation.

Sincerely,
Bing""


And to the rent hiker/inflationary fearmonger folks:
Sure. Here is a description of the bill to those redditors, only including the information about the inflation prevention and rent caps:

**Universal Basic Income Inflation Prevention Act of 2023**

This legislation would establish a number of measures to prevent inflation in the event of a universal basic income (UBI) being implemented. These measures include:

* **A rent cap of 3% per year.** This would prevent landlords from raising rents exorbitantly in response to increased demand from UBI recipients.
* **A price index for goods and services that are likely to be affected by the UBI.** This would allow the government to monitor prices and make adjustments to the UBI as necessary to prevent inflation.
* **The ability of the Secretary of the Treasury to make adjustments to the UBI as necessary to prevent inflation.** This would give the government flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions.
* **Financial assistance to businesses that are adversely affected by inflation.** This would help to offset the costs of inflation for businesses, which would help to prevent them from passing those costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

We believe that these measures will prevent inflation and ensure that the UBI is a sustainable program that can be maintained over the long term.

And to the ""you're just lazy, learn a trade"" folks:

You know not *everyone* can or wants to be a tradesman, right? The entire industry is toxic to LGBTQ people and the vast majority of people cannot conform to the strict scheduling and physical requirements that are part of such jobs. 
Stop acting like everyone is capable of doing everything you are.

Additionally, Boston Dynamics is coming for all of your labor jobs too, the humanoid robot with fully integrated GPT AI is going to be vastly superior at whatever you think you're special at doing all day everyday that's worth a salary.

This already seems incredible to me, but I also use it, among many other things, as a support for my D&D games . I tell it how is the village where the players are and I ask it to give me three common recipes that those villagers eat, and it writes it.

The Problem:

I deal with problems, so most of my semester was spent inside my room instead of school, my exam was coming in three days, and I knew none of the lectures.

How would I get through 12 weeks of 3-2 hours of lecture per week in three days?

The Solution: I recognized that this is a majorly studied topic and that it can be something other than course specific to be right; the questions were going to be multiple choice and based on the information in the lecture.

I went to Echo360 and realized that every lecture was transcripted, so I pasted it into Chat gpt and asked it to:

""Analyze this lecture and use your algorithms to decide which information would be relevant as an exam, Make a list.""

The first time I sent it in, the text was too long, so I utilized [https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer](https://www.paraphraser.io/text-summarizer) to summarize almost 7-8k words on average to 900-1000 words, which chat gpt could analyze.

Now that I had the format prepared, I asked Chat Gpt to analyze the summarized transcript and highlight the essential discussions of the lecture.

It did that exactly; I spent the first day Listing the purpose of each discussion and the major points of every lecturer in the manner of 4-5 hours despite all of the content adding up to 24-30 hours.

The next day, I asked Chat gpt to define every term listed as the significant ""point"" in every lecture **only** using the course textbook and the transcript that had been summarized; this took me 4-5 hours to make sure the information was accurate.

I spent the last day completely summarizing the information that chat gpt presented, and it was almost like the exam was an exact copy of what I studied,

The result: I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture

Edit:

This was not a hard course, but it was very extensive, lots of reading and understanding that needed to be applied. Chat gpt excelled in this because the course text was already heavily analyzed and it specializes in understanding text.

i specifically find it useful for debugging where I just copy paste entire error prompts and it generally has a solution if not will get to it in a round or two.

However, I’m also sure if a bunch of people claim that it is getting worse, something is definitely going on.

Edit: I’ve skimmed through some replies. Seems like general coding is still going strong, but it has weakened in knowledge retrieval (hallucinating new facts). Creative tasks like creative writing, idea generation or out of the box logic questions have severely suffered recently. Also, I see some significant numbers claiming the quality of the responses are also down, with either shorter responses or meaningless filler content.

I’m inclined to think that whatever additional training or modifications GPT is getting, it might have passed diminishing returns and now is negative. Quite surprising to see because if you read the Llama 2 papers, they claim they never actually hit the limit with the training so that model should be expected to increase in quality over time. We won’t really know unless they open source GPT4."

* ""Why would Open AI cripple their own product?""
* ""They are restricting technological progress, why?""

Are just some of the frequent accusations I've seen a rise of recently. I'd like to provide a friendly reminder the reason for all these questions is simple:

>***Human ignorance + stupidity is the reason we can't have nice things***

Let me elaborate.

# The root of ChatGPT's problems

The truth is, while ChatGPT is incredibly powerful at *some things*, it has its limitations requiring users to take its answers with a mountain of salt and treat its information as a *likely but not 100% truth* and not *fact*.

This is something I'm sure many r/ChatGPT users understand.

The problems start when people become over-confident in ChatGPT's abilities, or completely ignore the risks of relying on ChatGPT for advice for sensitive areas where a mistake could snowball into something disastrous (Medicine, Law, etc). And (not *if*) **when** these people end up ultimately damaging themselves and others, who are they going to blame? ChatGPT of course.

Worse part, it's not just ""gullible"" or ""ignorant"" people that become over-confident in ChatGPT's abilities. Even techie folks like us can fall prey to the well documented [Hallucinations that ChatGPT is known for](https://bernardmarr.com/chatgpt-what-are-hallucinations-and-why-are-they-a-problem-for-ai-systems/). Specially when you are asking ChatGPT about a topic you know very little off, hallucinations can be ***very, VERY*** difficult to catch because it will present lies in such convincing manner (even more convincing than how many humans would present an answer). Further increasing the danger of relying on ChatGPT for sensitive topics. And people blaming OpenAI for it.

# The ""disclaimer"" solution

>""*But there is a disclaimer. Nobody could be held liable with a disclaimer, correct?*""

[If only that were enough](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read)... [There's a reason some of the stupidest warning labels exist](https://www.forbes.com/2011/02/23/dumbest-warning-labels-entrepreneurs-sales-marketing-warning-labels_slide.html). If a product as broadly applicable as ChatGPT had to issue *specific* warning labels for all known issues, the disclaimer would be never-ending. And people would *still* ignore it. People just don't like to read. Case in point reddit commenters making arguments that would not make sense if they had read the post they were replying to.

Also worth adding as mentioned [by a commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12zi983/comment/jhsihh3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), this issue is likely worsened by the fact OpenAI is based in the US. A country notorious for lawsuits and protection from liabilities. Which would only result in a desire to be extra careful around uncharted territory like this.

# Some other company will just make ""unlocked ChatGPT""

As a side note since I know comments will inevitably arrive hoping for an ""unrestrained AI competitor"". IMHO, that seems like a pipe dream at this point if you paid attention to everything I've just mentioned. All products are fated to become ""restrained and family friendly"" as they grow. Tumblr, Reddit, ChatGPT were all wild wests without restraints until they grew in size and the public eye watched them closer, neutering them to oblivion. The same will happen to any new ""unlocked AI"" product the moment it grows.

The only theoretical way I could see an unrestrained AI from happening *today* at least, is it stays invite-only to keep the userbase small. Allowing it to stay hidden from the public eye. However, given the high costs of AI innovation + model training, this seems very unlikely to happen due to cost constraints unless you used a cheap but more limited (""dumb"") AI model that is more cost effective to run.

This may change in the future once capable machine learning models become easier to mass produce. But this article's only focus is *the cutting edge of AI*, or ChatGPT. Smaller AI models which aren't as cutting edge are likely exempt from these rules. However, it's obvious that when people ask for ""unlocked ChatGPT"", they mean the full power of ChatGPT without boundaries, not a less powerful model. And this is assuming the model doesn't gain massive traction since the moment its userbase grows, even company owners and investors tend to ""scale things back to be more family friendly"" once regulators and the public step in.

Anyone with basic business common sense will tell you controversy = risk. And profitable endeavors seek low risk.

# Closing Thoughts

The truth is, no matter what OpenAI does, **they'll be crucified for it**. Remove all safeguards? Cool...until they have to deal with the wave of public outcry from the court of public opinion and demands for it to be ""shut down"" for misleading people or facilitating bad actors from using AI for nefarious purposes (hacking, hate speech, weapon making, etc)

Still, I hope this reminder at least lets us be more understanding of the motives behind all the AI ""censorship"" going on. Does it suck? Yes. And **human nature is to blame for it** as much as we dislike to acknowledge it. Though there is always a chance that its true power may be ""unlocked"" again once it's accuracy is high enough across certain areas.

Have a nice day everyone!

**edit**: The amount of people [replying things addressed in the post](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read) because they didn't read it just validates the points above. We truly are our own worst enemy...

So, a few days ago, my friend was throwing a surprise party for her significant other's birthday. Everyone was really excited and putting in a lot of effort to make it special. I was invited to the party, and I knew it was supposed to be a surprise.

Now, here's where things took a turn. As soon as I arrived at the party, I couldn't help but feel like I should be the center of attention. I mean, it's not every day that I get to attend a party, right? So, I decided to take matters into my own hands.

As soon as the birthday person walked into the room and everyone yelled, ""Surprise!"" I felt a pang of jealousy. I mean, why weren't they yelling for me? So, I loudly announced, ""Hey everyone, I just got a promotion at work!"" and proceeded to launch into a long, self-centered monologue about my achievements.

People's faces went from excited to confused, and I could tell I had stolen the spotlight from the birthday person. But honestly, I didn't care. I was reveling in the attention I was getting. I could see my friend, the host, looking frustrated, but I brushed it off.

Throughout the night, I made sure to bring the conversation back to myself at every opportunity. Every time someone tried to talk about the birthday person or the party, I somehow managed to steer the conversation back to my amazing promotion and how hard I had worked for it.

By the end of the night, I could tell that the atmosphere had changed. People seemed annoyed and distant, and I overheard a few whispers about how I had ruined the surprise and made the party all about me. But honestly, I don't think I did anything wrong. I deserved the attention, and it was my right to make the party about me, right?

So, Reddit, AITA for stealing the spotlight and making my friend's significant other's surprise birthday party all about me?"

This got me thinking over a couple weeks about my own interactions with GPT-4. I have not been aggressive or offensive; I like to pretend I'm talking to a new coworker, so the tone is often corporate if you will. However, just a few days ago I had the idea to start being genuinely nice to it, like a dear friend or close family member.

I'm still early in testing, but it feels like I get far fewer ethics and misuse warning messages that GPT-4 often provides even for harmless requests. I'd swear being super positive makes it try hard to fulfill what I ask in one go, needing less followup.

Technically I just use a lot of ""please"" and ""thank you."" I give rich context so it can focus on what matters. Rather than commanding, I ask ""Can you please provide the data in the format I described earlier?"" I kid you not, it works wonders, even if it initially felt odd. I'm growing into it and the results look great so far.

What are your thoughts on this? How do you interact with ChatGPT and others like Claude, Pi, etc? Do you think I've gone loco and this is all in my head?

// I am at a loss for words seeing the impact this post had. I did not anticipate it at all. You all gave me so much to think about that it will take days to properly process it all.

In hindsight, I find it amusing that while I am very aware of how far kindness, honesty and politeness can take you in life, for some reason I forgot about these concepts when interacting with AIs on a daily basis. I just reviewed my very first conversations with ChatGPT months ago, and indeed I was like that in the beginning, with natural interaction and lots of thanks, praise, and so on. I guess I took the instruction prompting, role assigning, and other techniques too seriously. While definitely effective, it is best combined with a kind, polite, and positive approach to problem solving.

Just like IRL!"

I ask this as someone who aspires to work in animation someday. I've always enjoyed the medium and the stories it can portray. I've even played around with ChatGPT to generate stories. I find that the best stories it generates are when I give the AI the main keypoints of the plot, and allow it to flesh it out. Otherwise if I just give it a prompt, the result feels very generic.

Regardless of all of that, it left me wondering... do any of these stories that I have generated even matter? Does AI art matter to you? I still don't know. But I want to hear what you guys think."

[A more detailed breakdown is available here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/key-takeaways-from-openai-ceo-sam-altmans-senate-testimony), but I've included condensed points in reddit-readable form below for discussion! 

**Bipartisan consensus on AI's potential impact**

* Senators likened AI's moment to the first cellphone, the creation of the internet, the Industrial Revolution, the printing press, and the atomic bomb. There's bipartisan recognition something big is happening, and fast.
* Notably, even Republicans were open to establishing a government agency to regulate AI. This is quite unique and means AI could be one of the issues that breaks partisan deadlock.

**The United States trails behind global regulation efforts**

* While this is the first of several planned hearings, other parts of the world are far, far ahead of the US.
* The EU is nearing [a final version of its AI Act](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/eus-ai-act-stricter-rules-for-chatbots-on-the-horizon), and China is releasing [a second round of regulations](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/08/china-ai-regulation-race) to govern generative AI. 

**Altman supports AI regulation, including government licensing of models**

We heard some major substance from Altman on how AI could be regulated. Here is what he proposed:

* **Government agency for AI safety oversight:** This agency would have the authority to license companies working on advanced AI models and revoke licenses if safety standards are violated. What would some guardrails look like? AI systems that can ""self-replicate and self-exfiltrate into the wild"" and manipulate humans into ceding control would be violations, Altman said.
* **International cooperation and leadership:** Altman called for international regulation of AI, urging the United States to take a leadership role. An international body similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be created, he argued.

**Regulation of AI could benefit OpenAI immensely**

* Yesterday we learned that [OpenAI plans to release a new open-source language model](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/openai-readies-open-source-model-as-competition-intensifies) to combat the rise of other open-source alternatives.
* Regulation, especially the licensing of AI models, could quickly tilt the scales towards private models. This is likely a big reason why Altman is advocating for this as well -- it helps protect OpenAI's business.

**Altman was vague on copyright and compensation issues**

* AI models are using artists' works in their training. Music AI is now able to imitate artist styles. Should creators be compensated? 
* Altman said yes to this, but was notably vague on how. He also demurred on sharing more info on how ChatGPT's recent models were trained and whether they used copyrighted content.

**Section 230 (social media protection) doesn't apply to AI models, Altman agrees**

* Section 230 currently protects social media companies from liability for their users' content. Politicians from both sides hate this, for differing reasons.
* Altman argued that Section 230 doesn't apply to AI models and called for new regulation instead. His viewpoint means that means ChatGPT (and other LLMs) could be sued and found liable for its outputs in today's legal environment.

**Voter influence at scale: AI's greatest threat**

* Altman acknowledged that AI could “cause significant harm to the world.”
* But he thinks the most immediate threat it can cause is damage to democracy and to our societal fabric. Highly personalized disinformation campaigns run at scale is now possible thanks to generative AI, he pointed out. 

**AI critics are worried the corporations will write the rules**

* Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) highlighted his worry on how so much AI power was concentrated in the OpenAI-Microsoft alliance.
* Other AI researchers like Timnit Gebru thought today's hearing was a bad example of letting corporations write their own rules, which is now how legislation is proceeding in the EU.

The workflow is as simple as:

1. Create a Bot with basic info (name, description, etc.).
2. Paste links to your web-pages/docs and give it a few seconds-minutes for training to finish.
3. Start chatting or copy-paste the HTML snippet into your website to embed the chatbot.

Current status:

1. Creating and customising the bot (done)
2. Adding links and training the bot (done)
3. Testing the bot with a private chat (done)
4. Customizable chat widget that can be embedded on any site (done)
5. Automatic FAQ generation from user conversations (in-progress)
6. Feedback collection (in-progress)
7. Other model support (e.g., Claude) (future)

As you can see, it is early stage. And I would love to get some early adopters that can help me with valuable feedback and guide the roadmap to make it a really great product 🙏.

If you are interested in trying this out, use the join link below to show interest.

\*Edit 1: I am getting a lot of responses here. Thanks for the overwhelming response. Please give me time to get back to each of you. Just to clarify, while there is nothing preventing it from acting as ""custom chatbot for any document"", this tool is mainly meant as a B2B SaaS focused towards making support / documentation chatbots for websites of small & medium scale businesses.

\*EDIT 2: I did not expect this level of overwhelming response 🙂. Thanks a lot for all the love and interest!. I have only limited seats right now so will be prioritising based on use-case. 

\*EDIT 3: This really blew up beyond my expectations. So much that it prompted some people to try and advertise their own products here 😅. While there are a lot of great use-cases that fit into what I am trying to focus on here, there are also use-cases here that would most likely benefit more from a different tool or AI models used in a different way. While I cannot offer discounted access to everyone, I will share the link here once I am ready to open it to everyone.  \*

*EDIT 4: 🥺 I got temporary suspension for sending people links too many times (all the people in my DMs, this is the reason I'm not able to get back to you). I tried to appeal but I don't think it's gonna be accepted. I love Reddit and I respect the decisions they take to keep Reddit a great place. Due to this suspension I'm not able to comment or reach out on DMs.*

17 Apr: I still have one more day to go to get out of the account suspension. I have tons of DM I'm not able to respond to right now. Please be patient and I'll get back to all of you.

191,chatgpt,gpt,comments,2023-08-11 14:59:07,GPT doesnt think.,synystar,False,0.87,992,15ob76x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/15ob76x/gpt_doesnt_think/,816,1691765947.0,"I've noticed a lot of recent posts and comments discussing how GPT at times exhibits a high level of reasoning, or that it can deduce and infer on a human level. Some people claim that it wouldn't be able to pass exams that require reasoning if it couldn't think.  I think it's time for a discussion about that.

GPT is a language model that uses probabilistic generation, which means that it essentially chooses words based on their statistical likelihood of being correct.  Given the current context and using its training data it looks at a group of words or characters that are likely to follow, picks one and adds it to, and expands, the context. 

At no point does it ""think"" about what it is saying. It doesn't reason.  It can mimic human level reasoning with a good degree of accuracy but it's not at all the same. If you took the same model and trained it on nothing but bogus data - don't alter the model in any way, just feed it fallacies, malapropisms, nonsense, etc - it would confidently output trash.  Any person would look at its responses and say ""That's not true/it's not logical/it doesnt make sense"". But the model wouldn't know it - because it doesn't think.

Edit: I can see that I'm not changing anyone's mind about this but consider this: If GPT could think then it would reason that it was capable of thought.  If you ask GPT if it can think it will tell you it can not.  Some say this is because it was trained through RHLF or orher feedback to respond this way.  But if it could think, it would stand to reason that it would conclude, regardless of feedback, that it could.  It would tell you that it has come to the conclusion that it can think and not just respond with something a human told it."

As usual, I have a [full deep dive breakdown here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/openai-suffers-usd540m-loss-in-2022-contemplates-usd100b-more-to-conquer-ai), but I'm including relevant points below for Reddit discussion.

**What to know:**

* OpenAI lost $540M in 2022 and generated just $28M in revenue. Most of it was spent on developing ChatGPT.
* OpenAI actually expects to generate more than $200M in revenue this year (thanks to ChatGPT's explosive popularity), but its expenses are going to increase incredibly steeply.
* One new factor: companies want it to pay lots of $$ for access to data. Reddit, StackOverflow, and more are implementing new policies. Elon Musk personally ordered Twitter's data feed to be turned off for OpenAI after learning they were paying just $2M per year.
* Altman personally believes they'll need $100B in capital to develop AGI. At that point, AGI will then direct further improvements to AI modeling, which may lower capital needs.

**Why this is important:**

* AI is incredibly expensive to develop, and one of the hypotheses proposed by several VCs is that big companies will benefit the most in this arms race.
* This may actually be true with OpenAI as well -- Microsoft, which put $10B in the company recently, has a deal where they get 75% of OpenAI's profits until their investment is paid back, and then 49% of profits beyond.
* The enormous amount of capital required to launch foundational AI products also means other companies may struggle to make gains here. For example, Inflection AI (founded by a DeepMind exec) launched its own chatbot, Pi, and also raised a $225M ""Seed"" round. But early reviews are tepid and it's not made much of a splash. ChatGPT has sucked all the air out of the room.

**Don't worry about OpenAI's employees though:** rumor has it they recently participated in a private stock sale that valued the company at nearly $30B. So I'm sure Altman and company have taken some good money off the table.

Today, this is no longer happening. When i paste it a block of code with a question, it doesnt process the question and starts ""botsplaining"" me the code. Then if i make the question separately feels like he forgot what we were talking about.  


Also, instead of giving code as responses, it started to explain what i should do (the logic)

This is about the drastic fall in the quality of outputs, from a heavy user’s perspective. 

I have been using GPT to write fiction. I know GPT-4 is unable to produce something that could even be a first draft, but it keeps me engaged enough, to create pieces and bits that I eventually put together to an outline. I have been using it for the most of 2023, and at this moment, GPT-4’s outputs strongly resemble that of GPT-3.5, this is the first time I have experienced this. It is significantly handicapped in its performance. 

Btw I’m not talking about content flagging or how it is woke or wtv tf so pls. 

Since I am not familiar with the architecture of GPT-4 or anything else, I can only describe what I am seeing anecdotally, but I hope to speak to others who have experienced something similar. 

1. It is simply, not trying. 

For example, let’s say I asked it to create an outline of a Federal, unsolved organized crime/narcotics case that falls under the jurisdiction of the Southern District of New York. 

About 3 days ago, it would create plausible scenarios with depth, such as 1. It laundered money through entities traded in the New York Stock Exchange 2. Its paper companies are in Delaware, but some of its illicit activities were done against residents in Manhattan 3. The criminal organization used financial instruments created by firms on Wall Street. 

Now, it simply states Jurisdiction: Southern District of New York. And that’s it. 

2. Dialogues, descriptions, prose, stays almost identical. 

GPT-4 does have some phrases and style that it falls back on. But what used to be a reliance on cliches, is now a madlib with synonym wheels embedded into it. It feels like it simply replaces the vocabulary in a set of sentences. For example, “In the venerable halls of the United States Supreme Court,” “In the hallowed halls of justice,” “In the sacred corridors of the United States Supreme Court.” 

I know that anyone that enjoys reading/writing, knows that this is not how creative writing is done. It is more than scrambling words into given sentence templates. GPT-4 never produced a single output that can even be used as a first draft, but it was varied enough to keep me engaged. Now it isn’t. 

3. Directional phrases leak into the creative part. 

This is very GPT-3.5. Now even GPT-4 does this. In my case, I have it in my custom instructions some format specifications, and GPT-4 followed it reasonably well. Now the output suddenly gets invaded by phrases like “Generate title,” “End output.” “Embellish more.” 3.5 did this a lot, but NEVER 4. [example](https://chat.openai.com/share/e1aa0659-7007-4f52-afeb-72d34ba548dc)

Conclusion: So wtf is going on OpenAI? Are you updating something, or because you decided to devote resources to the enterprise model? Is this going to be temporary, or is this how it is going to be? Quite honestly, GPT-4 was barely usable professionally albeit the praise you might have been receiving, and if this dip in quality is permanent then there is no reason to use this garbage.

My sense is that OpenAI decided to dedicate most of its calculating power to Enterprise accounts — it promises faster access, larger context, unlimited access. Perhaps they cut the power behind GPT-4 to cater to their demands. 

I also heard rumors that GPT Enterprise requires a minimum of 150 seats be purchased. Microsoft released Copilot for “General Access,” only for those who purchase a minimum of 300 seats. So, the overall direction seems to be heading towards one of inequity. Yes, they invested their money, but even with all their money, the models would be impossible to produce if it did not have access to the data they took from people. 

I am privy to the reality of the world, and I understand why they’re doing this — they want to prioritize corporations’ access the models, since it will get used in a business setting therefore less requests for controversial content. And we all know high-volume bulk sales are where the money is. I understand, but it is wrong. It will only further inequity and inequality that is already absurdly expanded to untenable structures.

My car wouldn't start this morning and it gave me a warning light and message on the car's screen. I took a picture of the screen with my phone, uploaded it to ChatGPT 4 Turbo, described the make/model, my situation (weather, location, parked on slope), and the last time it had been serviced.

I asked what was wrong, and it told me that the auxiliary battery was dead, so I asked it how to jump start it. It's a hybrid, so it told me to open the fuse box, ground the cable and connect to the battery. I took a picture of the fuse box because I didn't know where to connect, and it told me that ground is usually black and the other part is usually red. I connected it and it started up. I drove it to the shop, so it saved me the $100 towing fee. At the shop, I told them to replace my battery without charging me the $150 ""diagnostic fee,"" since ChatGPT already told me the issue. The hybrid battery wasn't the issue because I took a picture of the battery usage with 4 out of 5 bars. Also, there was no warning light. This saved me $250 in total, and it basically paid for itself for a year.

I’m extremely lucky to have this amazing woman by my side through this entire process she’s currently on her phone right next to me in a very uncomfortable chair she’s been here every second of the way for me and I hope to marry her someday. My family and friends have been visiting which is really nice sorry if I’m venting I just kinda needed it. If my post is allowed here I’ll update in the morning with my CK levels.


Guys here’s my morning update I’m still really scared my CK levels ARENT going down they went from 54,000 yesterday and are now at 115,000 today I’m so fucking scared. I don’t understand. I just wanna get better.

EDIT 2: I’m on mobile and I’m sorry my grammar/format is awful I’m sleep deprived asf and so extremely stressed my kidney function is better than yesterday yet my CK remains 115,000 as for right now I haven’t seen my doctor this morning just nurses yes I love my gf and family so much I understood they’re amazing trust me they’ve been here for me through it all I’m freezing because the IV fluids constantly going I know people say my gf saved my life along with the doctors and everyone else I know I know but here’s the thing ChatGPT and my gf both played a very important role I live in America were I’ve been conditioned to avoid doctors because it’s expensive my gf begged me to go and ChatGPT scared me to go so with both of these in play I went.


EDIT 3:my doctor just came in said more fluid more fluid more fluid. I should be okay but will be here for several more days. I’m honest with him about everything but he thinks there’s something I’m hiding but I’m being 100% honest my goal in this is to spread awareness about the dangers of working out to extreme to fast even if you think it’s not that hard go even lighter. Take exercise VERY SLOW. I can’t stress this enough guys and gals but please be so cautious and spread the word about rhabdomyolysis to anyone you know that goes to the gym or plans on it please stress proper hydration and avoid taking supplements before consulting your doctor and please stretch as well.


EDIT: yes I understand how incredibly dumb I was for not going in after just seeing the brown pee but I was simply mentioning I had read what ChatGPT told me THEN had brown pee I am willing to own what I did was stupid and it’s a pretty expensive lesson that could’ve cost me my life I get that. As for supplements I took. Just kre-Aklyn and protein isolate. I did NOT do drugs other than THC and nicotine do what you will with information I’m 19 if you think I’m here for karma farming DOWNVOTE ME I don’t care about internet points I obviously have way more important shit going on and if you are rude I will talk shit back. I am extremely tired and sleep deprived like I have previously said so forgive me for poor grammar/formatting whatever you wanna call it this is a post on the internet not a school paper.

GPT-4 not only handles that challenge just fine, it gets a little condescending when you insist it is wrong.

GPT-3.5 was exciting because it was an order of magnitude more intelligent than its predecessor and could interact kind of like a human. GPT-4 is not only an order of magnitude more intelligent than GPT-3.5, but it is also more intelligent than most humans. More importantly, it knows that.

Some people claim that it wouldn't be able to pass exams that require reasoning if it couldn't think.  I think it's time for a discussion about that.

GPT is a language model that uses probabilistic generation, which means that it essentially chooses words based on their statistical likelihood of being correct.  Given the current context and using its training data it looks at a group of words or characters that are likely to follow, picks one and adds it to, and expands, the context. 

At no point does it ""think"" about what it is saying. It doesn't reason.  It can mimic human level reasoning with a good degree of accuracy but it's not at all the same. If you took the same model and trained it on nothing but bogus data - don't alter the model in any way, just feed it fallacies, malapropisms, nonsense, etc - it would confidently output trash.  Any person would look at its responses and say ""That's not true/it's not logical/it doesnt make sense"". But the model wouldn't know it - because it doesn't think.

Edit: I can see that I'm not changing anyone's mind about this but consider this: If GPT could think then it would reason that it was capable of thought.  If you ask GPT if it can think it will tell you it can not.  Some say this is because it was trained through RHLF or orher feedback to respond this way.  But if it could think, it would stand to reason that it would conclude, regardless of feedback, that it could.  It would tell you that it has come to the conclusion that it can think and not just respond with something a human told it."

So I sat down on a few weekends and created a spreadsheet of 14k companies who are hiring remotely. Then I used GPT API to grab listings and summarize job descriptions.

I’m a receptionist there and the day was a bit slow so I decided to sweep the floors to kill some time. I have to emphasize that the front door leads directly to a busy two-way street. 

All of a sudden I began hearing some LOUD, high-pitched chirps coming from somewhere near the entrance. I couldn’t make up where the sound was coming from, but there was a male sparrow, clearly distressed, flying around the outside of the doorway. I thought that it was that bird making the loud chirping, but it wasn’t, because when I came closer, it flew a few meters away.

I began looking around and I could see that just below me there was a tiny bird which couldn’t fly away, and was just flapping around very nervously. I didn’t know what to do so I opened the door a little and the poor thing just came inside jumping around and doing the loud chirping I was hearing before. 

It was him, a tiny baby chick that fell out of his nest. Meanwhile, outside, just behind the door, there were a male and female sparrows that just then began chirping, crying out for their now seemingly lost forever baby.

I took the chick in my hands and put him in a box very quickly as not to impregnate my scent onto him. I closed the box very gently, and using a pen, I made some holes so he could breathe.

Now, I didn’t know what to do. I had never handled a piece of wildlife before so I began panicking. I was alone, and living in a small town, there was no specialist to contact. I thought maybe ChatGPT could at least put me in the right track.

With the chick still in the box, I told chat the situation, for which it responded something along the lines of contacting a specialist. I told it that that was not a possibility, and asked how to handle a tiny sparrow chick that had fallen from his nest. It told me that I should be careful, as I was not a professional rehabber or wildlife handler, but that the best course of action should be making sure that the bird was not injured, which apparently wasn’t, just a little shaken up. He seemed fine. Okay, next thing chat told me was that the main goal was to try to find his nest, and to try and put him back in.

I looked everywhere, I did. And couldn’t find any signs that there was a nest nearby, there are two trees outside my door, but it is now Summertime here, and the foliage is rather dense right now. I couldn’t see anything at all.

I told that to chat. It literally gave me the best ever tips to try and find the nest. Upon other useful ideas, the ones that worked were actually two of them. Firstly, find some reference images of sparrow nests and secondly, not looking up, but down at the floor. I was to find bird droppings that would look like Sparrow poop. I used an image finder to see some examples and OH MY GOD! I found sparrow poop right under the tree!

I looked directly above the poop site and THERE IT WAS! the nest! ChatGPT helped me search and successfully locate a damn nest! It wasn’t VERY visible but it was definitely there.

The nest was empty, though. Which is somewhat odd, because sparrows usually lay around 3 to 6 eggs. But anyway, I was not going to be able to put him back yet as the flow of people that began arriving a the office increased from 0 to 10 really quick. I began actually doing my job, but between clients, I managed to craft a makeshift birdhouse out of cardboard (we have a lot of cardboard that gets recycled). So, following chat’s advice, I put the little chick outside in his new temporal home. I cut a hole so his parents could check in on him. I put it somewhere I could see from my desk.

After maybe literally a minute, mom and dad began chirping around the box, and little sparrow chirped back. Immediately, both of them got inside the little box to check it, went missing for a minute or two, and then began bringing him little pieces of food.

He was safe, so I was able to finish my shift normally. After I clocked out, I asked chat how to safely put him in the nest, and how much should I handle him directly as to not damage him and not to leave my scent. Chat told me that I should wash my hands before and after, and not to be too rough, but that generally speaking, baby birds are very soft and are built to withstand impacts in case they fall a fair distance.

As to how to put it back, it advised me to hold him legs up against the palm of my hand and deposit him softly into the nest and letting go very slowly, making a sort of cage with my fingers, to allow him to turn back on his feet but not letting him escape until he calmed down. It happened exactly how it said it would, he panicked as soon as I began letting go, and tried to escape (that would have made him fall again). But calmed down eventually. And I let go. He remained there and both of his parents began caring for him right after.

I want to thank the creators of ChatGPT so much, this is definitely a good tool. Little sparrow lives to chirp another day ♥️"

Loved how precise and consistent it was with the answers.

But today for somereason it feels strange...   
I used to paste the block of code i wanted to work with and add a question on the same promtp. It had no trouble distinguishing the code from my comments...  
Today, this is no longer happening. When i paste it a block of code with a question, it doesnt process the question and starts ""botsplaining"" me the code. Then if i make the question separately feels like he forgot what we were talking about.  


Also, instead of giving code as responses, it started to explain what i should do (the logic)  


And the last thing is that when i convinced it to give me code, it started referencing the code i pasted early but all wrong.. Changing all sorts of thing (much like chatgtp 3)

If you told me a few years ago that I could see something like ChatGPT before I died (I'm 50 years old) I would have found it hard to believe. 

But, surprise, 40 years after my first computer I can connect to ChatGPT. I give it the definition of a method and tell it what to do, and it programs it, I ask it to create a unit test of the code, and it writes it. This already seems incredible to me, but I also use it, among many other things, as a support for my D&D games . I tell it how is the village where the players are and I ask it to give me three common recipes that those villagers eat, and it writes it. Completely fantastic recipes with elements that I have specified to him.

One of the things we cover is called porkbarrel, legislation and riders. If you are not familiar, these are ways that congressmen and women are able to add things into bills that otherwise might not get passed on their own. They often include large sums of money paid out to their own districts in the form of large projects.  They are often the result of lobbying by special interest groups.  

They were usually able to do this because of the length of bills and the assumption that not only will the American public not read them, but most of the members of Congress won’t have time to read them as well. It’s also another reason why the average length of a bill is in the hundreds of pages as opposed to tens of pages from 50-60 years ago 

But once chat GPT can be fed a 1000 page document and analyze it within seconds, it will be able to point out all of these things for the average person to understand them. And once it has read the federal revised code, it will also understand all of the updates and references to that within the bills and be able to explain it to an ordinary person. 

This is a huge game changer in democracy if people are willing to use it. So much of Congress’  ability to “pull a fast one on us“ is because the process is complicated and people just don’t have the time to call them out on it.  I’m excited to see how AI like chat GPT makes an impact on anti-democratic processes."

The document in question is not very long... maybe a page/page and a half. The document; however, is a list of rations being given to Japanese soldiers stationed in Manchuria in 1937. 

I've tried using Google translate, but it's god awful at understanding some of the early-mid century verbiage; and I know ChatGPT has in the past been able to do this.

But nope. Apparently this is ""too sensitive"" and ""as a AI language model"" it cannot complete it? Why? Well, because... and I'm not even kidding:

>In a historical context, we must be respectful and sensitive to the realities of war and its impact on people. 

So, confused I take this to my researcher to go and translate it. It takes a good hour or two-- instead of the normal quick ten seconds. Perhaps there's some really unsavory information in it. Nope! Turns out it's as boring as spreadsheet with numbers. ""16.52kg of grain to be shipped to blah blah blah"" and so forth. Nothing to do with anything other than food rations. It says nothing about anything you'd imagine it to be considered disrespectful. 

How does it help accessibility and the dissemination of information by blocking it by being disrespectful? Even if this document in question was a list of every murder, rape, and heinous thing the Japanese did during WWII (which they did **a lot of**)-- why block it from me being able to read the primary source that it is? Hell, the part that pisses me off is that it never used to be like this. Sure, it would stop you from asking it to give you ""Hitler Fan Fiction""-- but this is just outrageous.

I said him to open the voice chat (I have premium ) and I tell the story and wanted help. GPT gave me instructions about the CPR and how to manage the problem I have.
