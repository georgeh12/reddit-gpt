For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

This is useful for coding in ChatGPT because it will allow you to select a class file, a folder, and instantly grab all relevant code from that folder that is referenced either in that class file or a dependency. That way, ChatGPT knows what your code means when it makes local references.

The script is a simple python script that:

1. Takes in a file and folder.
2. With the file, it searches for all files with the same extension in that folder.
3. It digs through the text of the original file, and grabs all filenames mentioned inside of it. It then digs through the text of all of the files found this way and so on. This creates a dependency tree. It stops when the dependency tree stays the same between loops. This only works for programming languages where the class name matches the file name.
4. Outputs the dependency chain sorted by proximity to the original file, and then by name.
5. You can then remove irrelevant files from the list before approving.

Here's a copy of the script in a gist:

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

\[Chat GPT\]: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Please provide me with the inputs you want me to evaluate and I will do my best to rate how good each input is on providing context and provide suggestions on how to improve each one.

\[ME\]: Okay, Here is the first test. Please rate and provide feedback on how good the context of my input is:  Description: I want a python code that will analyze a set of words in a CSV file and will perform computations on the set  Inputs: CSV file Computations: Total Word Count Top 10 words that occur in the set Top 10 words that occur least in the set Longest word 

\[Chat GPT\]:Here's my assessment of the context you provided:

Overall, your input provides a good level of context. You clearly state that you need a Python code that will analyze a set of words in a CSV file and perform computations on it, and you specify the computations that you want to perform (total word count, top 10 words that occur in the set, top 10 words that occur least in the set, and longest word).

However, there are a few areas where you could provide additional context to make your request more specific and actionable:

1. Clarify the format of the CSV file: It would be helpful to know the structure and format of the CSV file, such as the number and names of columns, the delimiter used to separate values, and any headers or metadata that are present.
2. Specify the criteria for determining the ""top"" and ""least"" occurring words: It would be helpful to know the criteria you are using to determine the top and least occurring words. For example, are you looking for the words with the highest and lowest frequency counts, or are you considering other factors like length or alphabetical order?
3. Clarify the expected output format: It would be helpful to know the expected format of the output. For example, do you need the results printed to the console or saved to a file? Do you need the output sorted in a particular order?

By providing this additional context, you can help ensure that the code I provide is tailored to your specific needs and requirements."

To the point, I'm really curious about how did manage Microsoft create the workflow to create PPT presentations with GPT? Because the API just allows text prompts and returns text. I don't see how the API could make a PPT presentation ([the link for those you don't know Co-Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7xTBa93TX8))

Did they ask GPT for the text through the API and they have a very-complicated code that takes the text returned from the API and creates the PowerPoint presentation? I don't think so. I think the API returned the power point already done. But how? How could we implement something like this by adapting GPT?

For example: Give a text prompt (can we give anything else than a text prompt, currently?) to GPT, and then GPT returns a 3-page manga comic. Or maybe give a text prompt and GPT returns the full structure of a website application like files and scripts organized in one folder (The current articles around the internet that claim that ""GPT built an app"" is GPT returning pieces of scripts and the human collecting them and structuring them).

Any ideas, git hub, or youtube videos about how this kind of implementation would be possible with GPT API?"

I've written something similar but rather than do all of the logic in Python or use something that goes off on its own without much control, I'm instead using English prompts as the primary logic language and it controls the workflow through a series of prompts that are fed the output of prior prompts and use a shared state.  My design focuses specifically on coding tasks.

In a nutshell, I maintain state in a Yaml file.   I inject the yaml file (and bash command output from the previous task) at the top of a prompt and then the prompt instructs GPT what changes to make to the Yaml state file and various shell commands to run.   The output is a revised yaml file, list of shell commands, and a diff to change other files.  The shell output and current state file are fed into the next prompt(s).
I use Yaml rather than json due to lower token count and better readability, especially with large text.

This results in a tiny kernel of only a few hundred lines of code.  Here's what it does:

1. Recursively search for `state.yaml` files to process
1. Get prompt file name from ""prompt-file-names"" array attribute of `state.yaml`.  File extension contains model name.  (This was probably set by the previous prompt.)
1. Prefix `state.yaml` and `console.log` files to the prompts.
1. Send each prompt to OpenAI's chat API and get result (yaml, bash, diff).
1. Write yaml code block in the output to `state.yaml`
1. Run bash code block to `console.log` (`bash -xeu &> console.log`)
1. Run `patch` on the output diff code block, if any.
1. `git commit -a -m <prompt-file-name>`
1. Repeat

Pros:

* Processing logic is described in English.  Complex things are possible with little effort.
* More control over the workflow
* Simple core design

Cons:

* Relying on GPT for logic may make it less reliable
* Less automatic, although you could easily write prompts that are with this design
* Higher cost and slower, due to relying on GPT to do the work

Types of prompts that can be written, although advanced ones might be clunky:

* Break into multiple tasks
* Prioritize tasks
* Categorization routing, such as asking a question and routing you to the correct prompt.
* Multiple phases of development: requirements, write UAT, code, review
* Multiple steps per phase: refine prompt, review prompt, validate/test, review output
* On test failure, go through set of steps to diagnose and fix
* Fork state (must invoke self via CLI)
* GPT-4 evaluation of GPT-3 generated output
* Various things with command line tools
    * Fetch issues from Github to create new objectives.
    * Web search via Google, Duck-duck-go, Stack overflow
    * Global search for fixed bugs in Github issues
    * Desktop notification
* Stop processing, so a manual code review can happen

Future considerations:

* Perhaps rename `state.yaml` to `objective.yaml`, and/or break it into multiple files: project, objective(s), state(s)
* Supply only a subset of `state.yaml` as needed by various prompts, and/or use a template language that can query (e.g. `The database tables are ${state.project.database.tables}.`).  Would require a delta format for updating.
* Integrate with langchains
* Better error handling

I'd appreciate feedback on my design.  Once I get a POC working, I'll put it on GitHub.

The rest of this post is a contrived example prompt.  I use better prompts than this, IRL.

----

The following code blocks are the current state and previous bash console output:

    ```yaml
    - objective: Generate a feature to add a contact
    - prompt-file-names: [prompts/run-read-requests.gpt-3.5-micro.md]
    - project
      - directories: [src/components, src/pages, src/lib, test]
        files-of-interest:
        - package.json: |-
          {}
        tables: [contacts]
        tables-of-interest:
          CREATE TABLE contacts (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, first_name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL, phone TEXT NOT NULL
          );
    - read requests:
      - request: Find all possible uses of contact
        type: bash-command
        command-line: rg contact -l
        status: incomplete
        file-list: []
    - write actions:
      - action: Add xyz package
        type: bash-command
        status: incomplete
        command-line: npm install xyz
    ```

    ```console
    + rg contact -l
    src/repo/contact.js
    src/service/contact.js
    src/components/contact.vue
    ```

Generate an updated state yaml code block given the following instruction bullets:

* Update the status of read requests based on the console output.
* Set prompt file names to '[prompts/process-action-errors.gpt-4.md]'

Generate a bash code block with write actions command line commands."

I occasionally use Chat GPT Pro with GPT-4 model to manually test how my code would work with the more capable model, but I find it a cumbersome way to develop and test my work.  My code exports user prompts that I manually copy-paste into Chat GPT-4 and I compare its responses to what gpt-3.5-turbo generated.

Some context: I'm building a database from web scraping using ChatGPT, for some finance research. I want to scrape some 70 research blogs from the website of the bank of england: [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news) (filter by ""Research Blog"").

I only want the main text on each webpage.

Since I'm using python, I know I need to use the Selenium package.

ChatGPT seems to be giving me a good enough code, however, the issue is that it gives me a code that works for the pre-2021 version of the website. So I think I need to get it to read the source code of the aforementioned html page to get a good idea of what to recommend me.

Here's some of what I learned from the process:

1. Write the code in small chunks.

Don't try to do too much in one prompt. For the program above, I told it to write a blank web page. Then I told it to create an object for the window. Then I told it to create a class for squares. Then I told it to create a method for creating a random square, etc.

If you don't do this, you will end up with spaghetti code.

2) Tell chatgpt how to architect the program.

It's helpful to spell out how you want the code structured. Tell it where you want a class and where you want to place methods. Like with #1, this also helps avoid creating disorganized spaghetti code.

3) Don't overestimate chatgpt's abilities.

I told chatgpt to make the squares bounce off each other in a realistic manner. I spent a couple of hours trying over and over to get this to work in a way that wasn't buggy. It finally dawned on me that chatgpt may be using math more suitable for round objects bouncing off each other not squares. As soon as I told it to explicitly to ensure the bounce algorithm was for squares, it got it right and the bounce effect was almost flawless.

4) If you are repeatedly telling chatgpt to do something to get something right, that's a sign you aren't coaching chatgpt very well or there is some kind of fundamental flaw with your approach.

Chatgpt frequently makes dumb mistakes. If something isn't working, you can often fix it by telling chapgpt about the mistake and it will fix it in one or two or sometimes three tries. Any more than that and it's a sign you need to backtrack and rethink how your code is architected.

5) It's definitely a lot less frustrating to code with chatgpt.

Not being a particularly talented math or physics guy, I would have had to tear my hair out trying to get the squares to bounce off each other in any kind of realistic manner. And there's a good chance I would have given up on the project after a few hours. But I was able to get the job done pretty well with chatgpt without even really understanding how the code worked.

6) Use chatgpt to ask big picture questions, not just code.

Instead of asking it to write code all the time, it's very useful to ask it bigger picture stuff to help you learn and find new ways of tackling a probelm. I knew next to nothing about how to detect collisions with animated objects. So I asked it to tell me about different strategies to detect collisions in animations and this helped me figure out better ways to structure the code to avoid bugs like the squares becoming entangled.

7) You can easily paint yourself into a corner with chatgpt

It's really easy to let chatgpt write the code for you and then move on without understanding it (see #5 above). This is a trap because it then becomes impossible to debug subtle bugs in the code even with chatgpt's help. Therefore, it's important to take the time to study the code chatgpt generates so you can fix any subtle bugs that crop up.

8) Amateurs will never be able to use ChatGPT for anything other than the simplest of programs.

At least for now, chatgpt is really only useful to those who already know how to code. Giving a nail gun to an amateur doesn't make them a carpenter who can frame a house. While chatgpt is great at writing simple functions and scripts, it's ability to structure large amounts of code into something that is maintainable is just about non-existent."

In my experience, the response of the API (which is similar to Playground) is worst than the main ChatGP. For instance, I always get a code for questions like that one, but the API responds:

    Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an example C code for Catmull-Rom Curve Fitting as it requires a detailed understanding of the algorithm and its implementation. However, I suggest you search online for resources and tutorials on Catmull-Rom Curve Fitting in C, which will provide you with the necessary information and code examples.

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

Hey there,

Never, chatgpt never replace programmers but chatgpt can support in programming through basic coding, loops, and fixing coding errors.

Here is the answer to How chatgpt helps programmers for programming.

ChatGPT, and other similar AI technologies, have the potential to impact the field of programming greatly, but it is unlikely that they will completely replace programmers. Here are a few reasons why: Absolutely! ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for programmers in various ways. Let's explore how ChatGPT can assist programmers in their programming tasks and provide them with additional enthusiasm.

&#x200B;

1. **Code Generation**: ChatGPT can generate code snippets or entire blocks of code based on the programmer's input or requirements. For example, a programmer can describe a specific task or algorithm to ChatGPT, and it can provide relevant code snippets in different programming languages. This can save time and effort for programmers, especially when they need quick references or examples to implement specific functionalities.
2. **Debugging Assistance**: ChatGPT can help programmers in debugging their code. A programmer can describe the issue or error they are facing, and ChatGPT can provide suggestions and solutions to resolve the problem. ChatGPT can analyze the code and identify potential issues, such as syntax errors, logic errors, or common coding mistakes, and provide guidance on how to fix them. This can help programmers in troubleshooting their code more effectively and improve their productivity.
3. **Learning and Education**: ChatGPT can serve as a learning resource for programmers. It can provide explanations, tutorials, and examples on various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and best practices. ChatGPT can also help programmers to understand complex topics in a more accessible and simplified manner, making learning more enjoyable and engaging.
4. **Project Planning and Management**: ChatGPT can help programmers with project planning and management tasks. It can provide suggestions and recommendations on project structure, code organization, version control, and other software development best practices. It can also help programmers in managing their tasks, deadlines, and milestones by providing reminders and scheduling assistance. This can help programmers in staying organized, meeting deadlines, and delivering high-quality projects.
5. **Collaboration and Brainstorming**: ChatGPT can facilitate collaboration among programmers by providing a platform for brainstorming and idea generation. It can help programmers in discussing and refining their ideas, providing feedback, and collaborating on code or documentation. ChatGPT can also help in fostering a creative and collaborative environment, enhancing team dynamics, and promoting innovation in programming projects.

* [**Memejourney** ](http://memejourney.thesamur.ai/)— ChatGPT for memes: Turn text into meme generation using ChatGPT, a midjourney for memes. Create memes by using memejournney.
* [**Heybot** ](https://heybot.thesamur.ai/)— Website to Chatbot powered by ChatGPT. Convert your website/blog into a chatbot in minutes without any coding.
* [**Ritebot**](https://ritebot.thesamur.ai/) **—** AI-powered Paraphraser, Grammar checker, Summariser, and Translator built on top of ChatGPT.

In conclusion, ChatGPT can be a valuable assistant for programmers, providing them with code generation, debugging assistance, learning and education, project planning and management, and collaboration and brainstorming support. Its ability to generate detailed and enthusiastic answers can inspire programmers and add a sense of enthusiasm in their programming tasks, making the overall experience more enjoyable and productive.

[**AutoGPT**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

AutoGPT's capabilities in combining GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via API and its ability to autonomously iterate on prompts and improve based on feedback open up a wide range of possibilities for its implementation in different use cases. From content generation to software development, recipe creation to task automation, and research assistance to summarization, AutoGPT can be a powerful tool for autonomously performing tasks, continuously improving its output, and showcasing true AGI capabilities."

I need to adjust the entire code, which sometimes takes more time than writing it from scratch.

ChartGPT 3.5 perfectly satisfies my need, and my only problem is incomplete codes. Can I resolve this issue by upgrading to Pro (4.0), or the number of tokens is the same?

Anyway, this is a text-based javascript golf game that ChatGPT and I put together in about five hours so far.  I estimate 80 percent of the credit goes to ChatGPT. ChatGPT even came up with the name. 

I don't know that I ever would have figured out the code for the swing meter that Chat spit out in five seconds.  Very cool technique. Feel free to look at/borrow the code. 

I'm still messing around with the game but I think it plays pretty well. I'm going to add a few display ads but doubt it will generate meaningful revenue.

I occasionally use Chat GPT Pro with GPT-4 model to manually test how my code would work with the more capable model, but I find it a cumbersome way to develop and test my work.  My code exports user prompts that I manually copy-paste into Chat GPT-4 and I compare its responses to what gpt-3.5-turbo generated.

**The following is some context for the question in case I'm going about it all wrong.**

Some context: I'm building a database from web scraping using ChatGPT, for some finance research. I want to scrape some 70 research blogs from the website of the bank of england: [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news) (filter by ""Research Blog""). It's 3 pages of results

I need it to go over the list of blogs, open each [one](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/bank-overground/2022/how-will-rising-prices-and-interest-rates-affect-companies-ability-to-service-their-debt), and label each unit according to the published date, and title. I only want the main text on each webpage.

Since I'm using python, I know I need to use the Selenium package.

ChatGPT seems to be giving me a good enough code, however, the issue is that it gives me a code that works for the pre-2021 version of the website. So I think I need to get it to read the source code of the aforementioned html page to get a good idea of what to recommend me.

**Question**:

**How can I pass the (very long) source code in Chrome to ChatGPT?**

Been trying to do it with the below tutorial, but I'm stumbling at the creation of a Javascript file. When I copy this code to an Eclipse IDE .js file, I'm getting errors. When I'm writing this code in a notepad and saving it as a .js file, then running it with Node.js, it's not working either. I'm completely out of my depth when it comes to Javascript.

I should start by saying I am not a coder (unfortunately).

With that out of the way -

I have a little system set up that is basically a google sheets file (I guess that stands in for a database) with a few google apps scripts running, pulling data from some api and doing very simple things with that data (normalization of the data and sending some emails about it).

A friend of mine, who is a decent coder, wrote those scripts for me. Now, since I want to keep my friend friendly, I don't want to bother him with little things, so I wanted to feed the scripts to either ChatGPT or GPT4 (no access atm) and ask it to help me with little changes.

There are 3 scripts - 2 that are very very short, and 1 that is just a little longer - 350 lines of code.

In ChatGPT I was unable to get clear answers - I had to break up the scripts for ChatGPT to ingest (which is fine), but it would also stop mid answer, and when I would ask it to continue it would restart in a different direction.

As for the playground - When I try to send the 350 lines script I see that it is just over the number of allowed tokens.

Any ideas for me? TIA"

I didn't really have a need for it until now, so I hadn't tried it out until today. I'm a fairly experienced programmer, and I thought it would be useful to have chatGPT generate a simple script for me, as opposed to sifting through documentation and writing repetitive code myself.

My experience has been that chatGPT has been absolutely terrible at writing code. Sure, it's been extremely impressive. It's written plausible, relatively accurate code, extremely quickly. But it failed miserably in all the small details.

This was my initial prompt, with the schedule itself omitted for privacy:

    Generate a google apps script code that will populate my google calendar with my university schedule. 
    The semester starts on 12/03/2023 and ends on 30/06/2023, so classes should only be scheduled in that time frame.
    There should not be any calendar notifications for these events.
    Words enclosed by parentheses should not be included in the title of the event. Events should be color coded: Events with the word ""Practice"" in the title should be Lilac, and all other events should be sage colored. Here is the schedule:
    
    SUNDAY: 
    Linear algebra II from 2-4pm, at building 104
    Calculus III from 4-5pm, at building C10, room 17
    MONDAY:
    .... and so on and so on

Well, I was initially pretty impressed. The code was unnecessarily long and complicated, and cut off in the middle, but it seemed like it would do what I wanted. I then noticed that the generated code thought that my semester started in december, as opposed to March (Interestingly it got the end of the semester right). So I asked it to fix the mistake, which it did. Then followed literal hours of me trying to get chatGPT to:

1. Pick up where it left off! (""continue"" simply resulted in it rewriting the function slightly differently, or skipping several steps)
2. Actually fix my code as opposed to writing the same exact thing again
3. Preform simple fixes to clean up the code and avoid repetition.
4. Break down the code in to functions. It quickly started forgetting which function was which, and would often completely forget the prompt at all.
5. Have any kind of consistency in formatting of objects.
6. Avoid using reserved words like ""class""
7. Stop writing unnecessary functions, for which a built in function already exists.
8. Remember my instructions from the initial prompt.
9. Avoid overwriting Calendar API function names.
10. Listen to me when I tell it that classes should recur every week.
11. Stop writing extremely long (and often unnecessary) comments
12. Stop calling nonexistent API functions.

Overall it was an extremely frusturating experience. Things like:

Me: ""Generate function number 5: 'getDate""

ChatGPT: Here is the function ... (proceeds to write a different function)

Me: That is not the function I asked for.

ChatGPT: I'm sorry, here is the correct function: (writes the correct function with some small mistakes)

Me: Please fix your mistake where you wrote ....

ChatGPT: I'm sorry, here is the corrected code: (Writes a different function entirely with a single line from the original function)

And it went on like that for 3 hours.

&#x200B;

Yes. ChatGPT is extremely impressive. It's truly a huge leap forward. I'm sure it is useful for generating algorithms, or writing small functions. But even this small task seemed too much for it. The mixups, the refusal to do what I needed, the seemingly terrible memory, were way too much.

Unless I'm missing something, it seems like the use for chatGPT in coding is as an assitant: ""Write me a function that will parse this ..."", or for getting ideas on how to structure code. But to have chatGPT write an entire website from scratch for someone who isn't a programmer, as so many posts and articles keep saying, simply seems impossible at this stage.

Please let me know what I'm missing or how I could better get it to write code!

&#x200B;

Wanted to reach out here to see if there are any wizards that can help out.

&#x200B;

I am currently building a platform that uses the ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo API but am having an issue where the execution time is far longer than it is in normal GPT 3 prompt form. 

&#x200B;

All the platform does is take the inputs from the user and insert them into a prompt that is fed to the GPT API, but the execution time is taking 2 minutes+ compared to the usual sub 10-20 seconds. 

&#x200B;

Any known fixes for this?  There must be a solution as there are many platforms that use the API successfully with the ability to deliver high-quality and quick answers.

&#x200B;

Please let me know if you have any insights - have a good day!"

I could train llama additionally with stackoverflow, our 600KLOC source code, our 50K+ git commit history, our 10K+ PR + JIRA history, our documentation, and similar training from our dependencies.

I've played with HuggingChat based on llama. It's good but not as good as GOT 3.5 or 4.  I am hopeful additional highly specific training would bridge the gap.

I ask because I don't want to waste time researching if it's not practical.

I tried following [this guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5247780-using-logit-bias-to-define-token-probability), and if I copy pasted their first example, the word ""time"" still appeared multiple times, which it shouldn't.  
I then tried on the gpt-3.5-turbo model myself but the responses are whacky. I am using the GPT2Tokenizer which uses the same one as suggested in [https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) and using it to try make the word ""duck"" appear more.  


1. Using a logit\_bias of 50 and 25 results in a sequence of ""\_s"" and ""</"" characters, which suggests that the tokenizer might be incorrect (also response times becomes longer than 5 minutes)?
2. Using a logit\_bias of 10 makes no difference, and no appearance of the word ""duck"" is made despite adding the logit\_bias parameter (response times are normal).

Wondering if anyone has any success with this or any tips to help me out?

To the point, I'm really curious about how did manage Microsoft create the workflow to create PPT presentations with GPT? Because the API just allows text prompts and returns text. I don't see how the API could make a PPT presentation ([the link for those you don't know Co-Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7xTBa93TX8))

Did they ask GPT for the text through the API and they have a very-complicated code that takes the text returned from the API and creates the PowerPoint presentation? I don't think so. I think the API returned the power point already done. But how? How could we implement something like this by adapting GPT?

For example: Give a text prompt (can we give anything else than a text prompt, currently?) to GPT, and then GPT returns a 3-page manga comic. Or maybe give a text prompt and GPT returns the full structure of a website application like files and scripts organized in one folder (The current articles around the internet that claim that ""GPT built an app"" is GPT returning pieces of scripts and the human collecting them and structuring them).

Any ideas, git hub, or youtube videos about how this kind of implementation would be possible with GPT API?"

The alternative, of course, is to break the request into chunks, GPT-3.5 style.. but.. I feel like if I'm paying for GPT-4, I ought to be getting to take advantage of the enhanced capabilities.

*As I'm not sure if gpt-3.5-turbo is the best product for this, I'll just call it AI.*

I need to provide **AI**  with a table of data that gets updated once a day. Users will ask questions, and the **AI** should respond with information based on this table. My goal is to update the old information with the new data in the morning, and then have the AI answer questions based on the fresh data for the rest of the day.

The challenge I'm facing is finding a way to efficiently provide **AI** with the updated table daily without incurring excessive costs. Ideally, I'd like to send the table just once a day and have the AI use the updated information for all user inquiries during that day.

Has anyone encountered a similar issue or have any suggestions on how to accomplish this? I would greatly appreciate any insights or ideas you may have!

&#x200B;

EXAMPLE:

I can ""simulate"" this in **ChatGPT4** or **3.5** interface by giving it this command:

    based on the table below, tell me car IDs that are red, cost more than 20k USD and are older than 5 years
    
    data:
    
    id,color,year,price,max_speed,...
    1,yellow,2010,200000,N/A,...
    2,red,2015,100k,100,...
    3,red,2019,100k,120,...

**ChatGPT** now responds something like: *I recommend car ID 2 as it costs 100k etc...*

***EDIT****: There might be more questions, so I need to keep context in the conversation. For example - ""Ok, I forgot to mention it should go faster than 100mph""*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I can't send this table with each request for 2 reasons:

1. the table is too big and it exceeds the limit
2. more tokens - higher price

&#x200B;

So the simplest way to do that would be to wait for ChatGPT4 API and send the table inside each request. But as I mentioned, I can't.

I'm not experienced in AI so I'll appreciate any advice. Should I use **gpt-3.5-turbo?** Or should I use some pre-trained model and fine tune it? Or something else?

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance for your help!

It's important to note that i use the API for my discord bot that i've made and i just use it to vent my feelings when i'm feeling down and surprisingly it helps me feel better so should i pay?

The reason why I don't use the official ChatGPT website is because i've heard the devs can see your chats and i don't want anyone seeing my chats as i say some stuff that i wouldn't want anyone to see and also ChatGPT might be busy when i need to use it and the API doesn't have this issue."

However, I frequently encounter the token limit leaving me with incomplete codes. I tried to use the API to have a 4K token limit.

I wonder if I can optimize the request to get a better response.

In my experience, the response of the API (which is similar to Playground) is worst than the main ChatGP. For instance, I always get a code for questions like that one, but the API responds:

    Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an example C code for Catmull-Rom Curve Fitting as it requires a detailed understanding of the algorithm and its implementation. However, I suggest you search online for resources and tutorials on Catmull-Rom Curve Fitting in C, which will provide you with the necessary information and code examples.

I hope to improve the response by adjusting the request parameters."

For more context, I asked ChatGPT:

> > How does gpt-3 differ from codex?
> 
> GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) and Codex are both large-scale language models created by OpenAI. However, they have some key differences in terms of their design, purpose, and capabilities.
>
> Design: GPT-3 is a generative model, while Codex is a retrieval model. This means that GPT-3 can generate new text based on a given prompt, while Codex retrieves relevant code snippets based on a natural language query.
>
> Purpose: GPT-3 is primarily designed for language tasks such as language generation, translation, summarization, and answering questions. Codex, on the other hand, is focused on generating code, with the aim of helping developers write code more quickly and efficiently.
>
> Capabilities: GPT-3 has been trained on a wide variety of tasks and can generate high-quality text in a range of styles and genres, while Codex is specifically designed for code-related tasks and has been trained on a large dataset of code repositories. Codex can generate code for a variety of programming languages, while GPT-3 is language-agnostic.
>
> Overall, while both GPT-3 and Codex are impressive language models, they have different strengths and are optimized for different tasks. GPT-3 is more suitable for language generation tasks, while Codex is more geared towards generating code.

I tried to ask about the new ChatGPT API and models, but it isn't yet aware of them.  I also confirmed that ChatGPT's model is basically just a simpler version of GPT-3.

I tried to get more answers:

> > What specific software development use cases would GPT-3 better a better choice than Codex?
> 
> GPT-3 may be a better choice than Codex for certain software development use cases that require natural language processing capabilities, rather than code generation. Some specific use cases where GPT-3 might be more useful than Codex in software development include:
> 
> Text-based user interfaces: GPT-3 can be used to generate natural language prompts and responses for text-based interfaces, such as chatbots or voice assistants.
> 
> Automated documentation: GPT-3 can be used to generate natural language documentation for software libraries and APIs.
> 
> Natural language processing tasks: GPT-3 can be used for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language translation.
> 
> Content creation: GPT-3 can be used to generate natural language content, such as articles, product descriptions, and reviews.
> 
> In these cases, GPT-3's language generation capabilities can be leveraged to automate certain aspects of software development that require natural language processing, without necessarily involving the generation of code. However, it's important to note that GPT-3 is not specifically designed for software development, and its outputs may require additional processing or filtering to be used effectively in a software development context.

> > Would GPT-3 be better than Codex at adding comments to source code that has no existing comments?
> 
> GPT-3 and Codex have different strengths when it comes to adding comments to source code.
> 
> Codex is specifically designed for software development and has been trained on a massive corpus of code from GitHub and other sources. It can generate comments that are specific to the code and provide context about what the code does, making it a powerful tool for adding comments to source code.
> 
> On the other hand, GPT-3's language generation capabilities may be useful in cases where there is no existing context for the code. For example, if there is a code snippet that is not well-documented and requires additional context, GPT-3 could be used to generate comments that provide more information about the code's purpose.
> 
> However, it's important to note that GPT-3's outputs may require additional processing or filtering to be used effectively in a software development context. In contrast, Codex generates comments that are more specific to the code and require less filtering.

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

I then tried on the gpt-3.5-turbo model myself but the responses are whacky. I am using the GPT2Tokenizer which uses the same one as suggested in [https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) and using it to try make the word ""duck"" appear more.  


1. Using a logit\_bias of 50 and 25 results in a sequence of ""\_s"" and ""</"" characters, which suggests that the tokenizer might be incorrect (also response times becomes longer than 5 minutes)?
2. Using a logit\_bias of 10 makes no difference, and no appearance of the word ""duck"" is made despite adding the logit\_bias parameter (response times are normal).

I've written something similar but rather than do all of the logic in Python or use something that goes off on its own without much control, I'm instead using English prompts as the primary logic language and it controls the workflow through a series of prompts that are fed the output of prior prompts and use a shared state.  My design focuses specifically on coding tasks.

In a nutshell, I maintain state in a Yaml file.   I inject the yaml file (and bash command output from the previous task) at the top of a prompt and then the prompt instructs GPT what changes to make to the Yaml state file and various shell commands to run.   The output is a revised yaml file, list of shell commands, and a diff to change other files.  The shell output and current state file are fed into the next prompt(s).
I use Yaml rather than json due to lower token count and better readability, especially with large text.

This results in a tiny kernel of only a few hundred lines of code.  Here's what it does:

1. Recursively search for `state.yaml` files to process
1. Get prompt file name from ""prompt-file-names"" array attribute of `state.yaml`.  File extension contains model name.  (This was probably set by the previous prompt.)
1. Prefix `state.yaml` and `console.log` files to the prompts.
1. Send each prompt to OpenAI's chat API and get result (yaml, bash, diff).
1. Write yaml code block in the output to `state.yaml`
1. Run bash code block to `console.log` (`bash -xeu &> console.log`)
1. Run `patch` on the output diff code block, if any.
1. `git commit -a -m <prompt-file-name>`
1. Repeat

Pros:

* Processing logic is described in English.  Complex things are possible with little effort.
* More control over the workflow
* Simple core design

Cons:

* Relying on GPT for logic may make it less reliable
* Less automatic, although you could easily write prompts that are with this design
* Higher cost and slower, due to relying on GPT to do the work

Types of prompts that can be written, although advanced ones might be clunky:

* Break into multiple tasks
* Prioritize tasks
* Categorization routing, such as asking a question and routing you to the correct prompt.
* Multiple phases of development: requirements, write UAT, code, review
* Multiple steps per phase: refine prompt, review prompt, validate/test, review output
* On test failure, go through set of steps to diagnose and fix
* Fork state (must invoke self via CLI)
* GPT-4 evaluation of GPT-3 generated output
* Various things with command line tools
    * Fetch issues from Github to create new objectives.
    * Web search via Google, Duck-duck-go, Stack overflow
    * Global search for fixed bugs in Github issues
    * Desktop notification
* Stop processing, so a manual code review can happen

Future considerations:

* Perhaps rename `state.yaml` to `objective.yaml`, and/or break it into multiple files: project, objective(s), state(s)
* Supply only a subset of `state.yaml` as needed by various prompts, and/or use a template language that can query (e.g. `The database tables are ${state.project.database.tables}.`).  Would require a delta format for updating.
* Integrate with langchains
* Better error handling

I'd appreciate feedback on my design.  Once I get a POC working, I'll put it on GitHub.

The rest of this post is a contrived example prompt.  I use better prompts than this, IRL.

----

The following code blocks are the current state and previous bash console output:

    ```yaml
    - objective: Generate a feature to add a contact
    - prompt-file-names: [prompts/run-read-requests.gpt-3.5-micro.md]
    - project
      - directories: [src/components, src/pages, src/lib, test]
        files-of-interest:

          {}
        tables: [contacts]
        tables-of-interest:
          CREATE TABLE contacts (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, first_name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL, phone TEXT NOT NULL
          );
    - read requests:
      - request: Find all possible uses of contact
        type: bash-command
        command-line: rg contact -l

    ```

    ```console
    + rg contact -l
    src/repo/contact.js
    src/service/contact.js
    src/components/contact.vue
    ```

Generate an updated state yaml code block given the following instruction bullets:

* Update the status of read requests based on the console output.
* Set prompt file names to '[prompts/process-action-errors.gpt-4.md]'

Generate a bash code block with write actions command line commands."

Hey there,

Never, chatgpt never replace programmers but chatgpt can support in programming through basic coding, loops, and fixing coding errors.

Here is the answer to How chatgpt helps programmers for programming.

ChatGPT, and other similar AI technologies, have the potential to impact the field of programming greatly, but it is unlikely that they will completely replace programmers. Here are a few reasons why: Absolutely! ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for programmers in various ways. Let's explore how ChatGPT can assist programmers in their programming tasks and provide them with additional enthusiasm.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6n4lyr080fxa1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f39392b6a5b6c1761d904406d362c89fbb7201b

1. **Code Generation**: ChatGPT can generate code snippets or entire blocks of code based on the programmer's input or requirements. For example, a programmer can describe a specific task or algorithm to ChatGPT, and it can provide relevant code snippets in different programming languages. This can save time and effort for programmers, especially when they need quick references or examples to implement specific functionalities.
2. **Debugging Assistance**: ChatGPT can help programmers in debugging their code. A programmer can describe the issue or error they are facing, and ChatGPT can provide suggestions and solutions to resolve the problem. ChatGPT can analyze the code and identify potential issues, such as syntax errors, logic errors, or common coding mistakes, and provide guidance on how to fix them. This can help programmers in troubleshooting their code more effectively and improve their productivity.
3. **Learning and Education**: ChatGPT can serve as a learning resource for programmers. It can provide explanations, tutorials, and examples on various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and best practices. ChatGPT can also help programmers to understand complex topics in a more accessible and simplified manner, making learning more enjoyable and engaging.
4. **Project Planning and Management**: ChatGPT can help programmers with project planning and management tasks. It can provide suggestions and recommendations on project structure, code organization, version control, and other software development best practices. It can also help programmers in managing their tasks, deadlines, and milestones by providing reminders and scheduling assistance. This can help programmers in staying organized, meeting deadlines, and delivering high-quality projects.
5. **Collaboration and Brainstorming**: ChatGPT can facilitate collaboration among programmers by providing a platform for brainstorming and idea generation. It can help programmers in discussing and refining their ideas, providing feedback, and collaborating on code or documentation. ChatGPT can also help in fostering a creative and collaborative environment, enhancing team dynamics, and promoting innovation in programming projects.

Here is the list of products that which is based on chatgpt

* [**MyGPT** ](https://mygpt.thesamur.ai/)— This is one of the best products that I have used. Even after chatgpt is its highest capacity these products work a lot. MyGPT using ChatGPT API and provide same results as chatgpt provides. MyGPT is just a front-end UI of Chatgpt API, that help you get very responsive output even at the time of chatgpt is on its capacity. You can also see the short prompt.
* [**Memejourney** ](http://memejourney.thesamur.ai/)— ChatGPT for memes: Turn text into meme generation using ChatGPT, a midjourney for memes. Create memes by using memejournney.
* [**Heybot** ](https://heybot.thesamur.ai/)— Website to Chatbot powered by ChatGPT. Convert your website/blog into a chatbot in minutes without any coding.
* [**Ritebot**](https://ritebot.thesamur.ai/) **—** AI-powered Paraphraser, Grammar checker, Summariser, and Translator built on top of ChatGPT.

In conclusion, ChatGPT can be a valuable assistant for programmers, providing them with code generation, debugging assistance, learning and education, project planning and management, and collaboration and brainstorming support. Its ability to generate detailed and enthusiastic answers can inspire programmers and add a sense of enthusiasm in their programming tasks, making the overall experience more enjoyable and productive.

[**AutoGPT**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

AutoGPT's capabilities in combining GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via API and its ability to autonomously iterate on prompts and improve based on feedback open up a wide range of possibilities for its implementation in different use cases. From content generation to software development, recipe creation to task automation, and research assistance to summarization, AutoGPT can be a powerful tool for autonomously performing tasks, continuously improving its output, and showcasing true AGI capabilities."

I occasionally use Chat GPT Pro with GPT-4 model to manually test how my code would work with the more capable model, but I find it a cumbersome way to develop and test my work.  My code exports user prompts that I manually copy-paste into Chat GPT-4 and I compare its responses to what gpt-3.5-turbo generated.

I just got my API 4 access for GPT 4 and I would like to test something with it. Up to now, I read a lot but still some points are a bit foggy. Hopefully someone more advances can clarify things better.

1. I have a subscription plan with OpenAI for the Chat GPT 4. I also know that we pay per use when we use the chat GPT 4 APIs, and that we have to set up billing information also for that. If I want to start using only the APIs, can I cancel my subscription with Chat GPT? Or do I have to keep both? Would you suggest that?
2. As an IT I use ChatGPT mainly for Powershell scripting. and ChatGPT is already fuc\*\*\*g awesome.  Can you suggest a specific plugin for Powershell and generally for programming? I am not a developer, just to test things out and I would appreciate something particularly good ad coding - especially with powershell (no, I am not a fan og Github Copilot right now, I would like to chat with it, not only ask to debug code or finish something, I'll have to wait for Copilot X) . Would be great with internet access Maybe AutoGPT?
3. AutoGPT can create a ""memory"" file on the local pc, or use an external vector database like Pinecone and similar. Why would I use something like Pinecone? What kind of advantage I would have in using such tool and maybe even paying for it? The only advantage I see right now is the possibility of using the ""memory"" on different pc's, is there something else?
4. What would you suggest to set up AutoGPT once, and then use it on multiple computers (eg. work and private)? Set up a virtual machine? Use a raspberry PI? Copy the configured folder over...?
5. When creating the API Key, I cannot choose between GPT 3.5 Model and 4. Do plugins select automatically the GPT 4 model or do I have to change some configuration file?

Good features:

- conversation history search

- keyboard navigation

- preprompt selection

- output appears all at once

It only works with `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for now (no plugins or image input), and you'll need [an API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), but within its limited scope it's buttery-smooth and (seemingly) bug-free.

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

ChartGPT 3.5 perfectly satisfies my need, and my only problem is incomplete codes. Can I resolve this issue by upgrading to Pro (4.0), or the number of tokens is the same?

*As I'm not sure if gpt-3.5-turbo is the best product for this, I'll just call it AI.*

I need to provide **AI**  with a table of data that gets updated once a day. Users will ask questions, and the **AI** should respond with information based on this table. My goal is to update the old information with the new data in the morning, and then have the AI answer questions based on the fresh data for the rest of the day.

The challenge I'm facing is finding a way to efficiently provide **AI** with the updated table daily without incurring excessive costs. Ideally, I'd like to send the table just once a day and have the AI use the updated information for all user inquiries during that day.

Has anyone encountered a similar issue or have any suggestions on how to accomplish this? I would greatly appreciate any insights or ideas you may have!

&#x200B;

EXAMPLE:

I can ""simulate"" this in **ChatGPT4** or **3.5** interface by giving it this command:

    based on the table below, tell me car IDs that are red, cost more than 20k USD and are older than 5 years
    
    data:
    
    id,color,year,price,max_speed,...
    1,yellow,2010,200000,N/A,...
    2,red,2015,100k,100,...
    3,red,2019,100k,120,...

**ChatGPT** now responds something like: *I recommend car ID 2 as it costs 100k etc...*

***EDIT****: There might be more questions, so I need to keep context in the conversation. For example - ""Ok, I forgot to mention it should go faster than 100mph""*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I can't send this table with each request for 2 reasons:

1. the table is too big and it exceeds the limit
2. more tokens - higher price

&#x200B;

So the simplest way to do that would be to wait for ChatGPT4 API and send the table inside each request. But as I mentioned, I can't.

I'm not experienced in AI so I'll appreciate any advice. Should I use **gpt-3.5-turbo?** Or should I use some pre-trained model and fine tune it? Or something else?

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance for your help!
