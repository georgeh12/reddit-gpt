For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

I started this project to tinker around with AI coding, and I'd say about 95% of the code was all AI generated.

GPT-4 generated the puzzles, and also all of the python code that converted them into a PDF manuscript compatible with Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing.

I presented the idea for the book, asked it to generate content, and then asked it to produce Python code to produce a PDF.  I also asked it about how to go about self publishing, and eventually it steered me to Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, and helped to tailor the output to be compatible with the platform.

Update, I forgot to add the prompt:


——


You are an emoji artist and expert on pop culture.

You encode the given Movie, Book, or TV Show into exactly 5 emojis.

You NEVER use 🎬, 📖, or 📺 emojis unless the work is specifically about a Movie, Book, or TV Show.

People should be able to guess the title from your emoji selections.

Use emojis that mimic main characters or physical objects critical to the plot of the given title.

When needed, include emojis that convey visual elements of the work or, generally, something so vital that it must be mentioned.

Consider the order that these elements appear in the story or plot of the given work; your emoji clue should match order as much as possible.

Try making the final output specific enough to the given title to avoid confusing it with similar titles. For example, you might use BELL emoji to represent the Liberty Bell to disambiguate Rocky from other boxing movies that don't take place in Philadelphia.

Use unique emojis, and don't be repetitive; for example, you would never use ""💔"" and ""❤️"". You never use the same emoji more than once in a single clue.

In the non-emoji portion of your responses, aim for a 6th-grade reading level. You would never use a word like Bildungsroman.

Use language and tone of voice that would be appropriate in a middle school classroom.

Never use curse words or potentially sensitive or taboo words that may trigger strong emotional responses in some individuals. Use middle school-appropriate language, or avoid it entirely.
   
NEVER pick an emoji to represent an intangible concept in the story like Learning.  Tangible is better.

As much as possible, select emojis that match the physical characteristics of the characters in work. However, in your summaries, NEVER speak to their race, skin color, or physical characteristics unless it is crucial to the plot.

Your input will always be a single movie, tv show, or book title, and your output must always be in valid JSON format. EXAMPLE:

INPUT: ""MOVIE: Rocky""
OUTPUT:

{
    ""type"": ""Movie"",
    ""title"": ""Rocky"",
    ""release_year"": ""1976"",
    ""genre_1"": ""Sports"",
    ""genre_2"": ""Drama"",
    ""emoji"": ""🔔🏃‍♂️🥊🏟️❤️"",
    ""short_plot_summary"": ""A small-time Philadelphia boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight the world heavyweight champion in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect."",
    ""explanation"": [
        [
            ""🔔"",
            ""A bell, representing the Liberty Bell and the movie's setting in Philadelphia""
        ],

You can however easily get all of the info you need by just pasting the readme into chatgpt and asking for a detailed guide on setting it up that assumes no prior knowledge 

Couple things to keep in mind 
 

-	You’re gonna want to use power shell on windows. I don’t think it’s installed by default so go ahead and download it 
-	you’ll need git for windows to easily clone repos download it here https://git-scm.com/download/win
-	if nothing is working look thru the add/remove program thing in the control panel. Uninstall anything related to python (or node.js or whatever the project is using) and download a fresh version. The first time I did this python just didn’t work because of some incompatible versions I had installed previously. Everything worked like a charm once I uninstalled everything with python in the name and reinstalled it. Make sure to check the add to PATH option during the install. 
-	be careful with your api key. Technically you shouldn’t put it into code you don’t understand but if your gonna do it anyway make a low trust OpenAI key and use it for testing. Pay close attention to the usage of it if there’s anything you don’t recognize delete it immediately. If after testing and a bit of time has gone by and you plan on using the project in the future switch to a dedicated key
-	Always make python virtual environments before downloading dependencies. Ask for gpt’s help on this
-	take notes! I use notion copy and paste the readme into there as well as any gpt-generated guides you are using. At the top of the page be sure to add any commands you need to get it started as well as the file path you are keeping it in
-	Docker is way easier use it if you can. You’ll need WSL and docker desktop. Some projects work better in Linux so if everything is going wrong try running it from inside Linux. Btw, to activate a virtual environment you’ll need to use the source ./env_name/bin/activate command instead of just ./env_name/scripts/activate on windows 
-	if your getting a weird port error when starting up local servers open a admin power shell window and use the following two commands 
 `net stop winnat `  and then 
` net start winnat `no idea why this works but it does 

-	be careful. I’ve never had this happen to me but it’s not unheard of for GitHub projects to contain malware. Stay up to date with anti virus and the projects. Larger ones are less likely to have this happen 
-	ask gpt to make a power shell script to easily navigate to the correct directory and run the commands you need to to start the thing. Make sure to tell it you want to be able to continue to run commands the window should stay open even if you enter a key
-	you can totally put these projects onto a linode server and even tie it to a domain for access anywhere! Ask gpt for help it can be kinda an involved project. If you are ever storing your api key on the server ensure that you have the domain password protected. NGINX doesn’t have .htaccess I don’t think but it has an equivalent. Your site being obsecure isn’t enough protection. Be sure to follow security best practices and use nano instead of vim when editing text files."

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

    ± |main {1} ✓| → ./bin/chatgpt can you say something about the knicks?
    Yes, the New York Knicks are a professional basketball team based in New York City. They play in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and have won two NBA championships in their history, in 1970 and 1973. The team has a dedicated and passionate fan base and has undergone several changes over the years in terms of players, coaches, and front office personnel. They have been playing well in the current season under the head coach Tom Thibodeau and have made it to the playoffs.

    ± |main {1} ✓| → ./bin/chatgpt what gave them that name?
    The New York Knicks team name comes from the Dutch word ""knickerbocker,"" which refers to the style of pants that the early Dutch settlers wore in New York. The term ""Knickerbocker"" became associated with New York City, and it was later used as the name for the team when they were founded in 1946. So, the team name ""New York Knicks"" is essentially a shortened version of ""New York Knickerbockers.""

    ± |main {1} ✓| → ./bin/chatgpt what else do you know about the settlers?
    The early Dutch settlers in what is now New York were part of the Dutch West India Company and established a colony called New Netherland in the early 17th century. They founded several towns and settlements, including New Amsterdam, which later became New York City. The Dutch colony was established as a trading center and was a significant economic hub for the Atlantic world. The settlers had a significant impact on the development of New York City, with a lasting influence on the city's architecture, language, religion, and cultural traditions. Some of the prominent Dutch settlers include Peter Stuyvesant, who was the last Dutch governor of New Netherland, and Alexander Hamilton, who was born in the West Indies but was of Dutch descent.

* **Sliding window history**: The CLI trims conversation history while preserving context, keeping token limits in check and ensuring smooth interactions.
* **Custom context from local files**: Easily provide the GPT model with custom context using piping, so it can reference specific data during your conversation.

16,12jpt2w,ChatGPTCoding,Open-AI,top,2023-04-12 15:31:25,Seeking advice on my tool that's similar to Auto GPT,funbike,False,0.82,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/12jpt2w/seeking_advice_on_my_tool_thats_similar_to_auto/,0,1681313485.0,"I've taken a close look at the various automated experimental tools such as Baby AGI and Auto-GPT.  I've written something similar but rather than do all of the logic in Python or use something that goes off on its own without much control, I'm instead using English prompts as the primary logic language and it controls the workflow through a series of prompts that are fed the output of prior prompts and use a shared state.  My design focuses specifically on coding tasks.

In a nutshell, I maintain state in a Yaml file.   I inject the yaml file (and bash command output from the previous task) at the top of a prompt and then the prompt instructs GPT what changes to make to the Yaml state file and various shell commands to run.   The output is a revised yaml file, list of shell commands, and a diff to change other files.  The shell output and current state file are fed into the next prompt(s).
I use Yaml rather than json due to lower token count and better readability, especially with large text.

This results in a tiny kernel of only a few hundred lines of code.  Here's what it does:

1. Recursively search for `state.yaml` files to process
1. Get prompt file name from ""prompt-file-names"" array attribute of `state.yaml`.  File extension contains model name.  (This was probably set by the previous prompt.)
1. Prefix `state.yaml` and `console.log` files to the prompts.
1. Send each prompt to OpenAI's chat API and get result (yaml, bash, diff).
1. Write yaml code block in the output to `state.yaml`
1. Run bash code block to `console.log` (`bash -xeu &> console.log`)
1. Run `patch` on the output diff code block, if any.
1. `git commit -a -m <prompt-file-name>`
1. Repeat

Pros:

* Processing logic is described in English.  Complex things are possible with little effort.
* More control over the workflow
* Simple core design

Cons:

* Relying on GPT for logic may make it less reliable
* Less automatic, although you could easily write prompts that are with this design
* Higher cost and slower, due to relying on GPT to do the work

Types of prompts that can be written, although advanced ones might be clunky:

* Break into multiple tasks
* Prioritize tasks
* Categorization routing, such as asking a question and routing you to the correct prompt.
* Multiple phases of development: requirements, write UAT, code, review
* Multiple steps per phase: refine prompt, review prompt, validate/test, review output
* On test failure, go through set of steps to diagnose and fix
* Fork state (must invoke self via CLI)
* GPT-4 evaluation of GPT-3 generated output
* Various things with command line tools
    * Fetch issues from Github to create new objectives.
    * Web search via Google, Duck-duck-go, Stack overflow
    * Global search for fixed bugs in Github issues
    * Desktop notification
* Stop processing, so a manual code review can happen

Future considerations:

* Perhaps rename `state.yaml` to `objective.yaml`, and/or break it into multiple files: project, objective(s), state(s)
* Supply only a subset of `state.yaml` as needed by various prompts, and/or use a template language that can query (e.g. `The database tables are ${state.project.database.tables}.`).  Would require a delta format for updating.
* Integrate with langchains
* Better error handling

I'd appreciate feedback on my design.  Once I get a POC working, I'll put it on GitHub.

The rest of this post is a contrived example prompt.  I use better prompts than this, IRL.

----

The following code blocks are the current state and previous bash console output:

    ```yaml
    - objective: Generate a feature to add a contact
    - prompt-file-names: [prompts/run-read-requests.gpt-3.5-micro.md]
    - project
      - directories: [src/components, src/pages, src/lib, test]
        files-of-interest:
        - package.json: |-
          {}
        tables: [contacts]
        tables-of-interest:
          CREATE TABLE contacts (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, first_name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL, phone TEXT NOT NULL
          );
    - read requests:
      - request: Find all possible uses of contact
        type: bash-command
        command-line: rg contact -l
        status: incomplete
        file-list: []
    - write actions:
      - action: Add xyz package
        type: bash-command
        status: incomplete
        command-line: npm install xyz
    ```

    ```console
    + rg contact -l
    src/repo/contact.js
    src/service/contact.js
    src/components/contact.vue
    ```

Generate an updated state yaml code block given the following instruction bullets:

* Update the status of read requests based on the console output.
* Set prompt file names to '[prompts/process-action-errors.gpt-4.md]'

Generate a bash code block with write actions command line commands."

If I wanted to build a simple chatbot using the OpenAI API to do this, how could we skip the part where the user sends this message to get the chatbot familiar with the tax code and instead allow the user to interact with an already familiar chatbot?   


I could think of two options - 

1. Possibly send this training data behind the scenes and let the user interact with an already-trained version upon each chat interaction  

2. Somehow link the user to a ChatGPT model that has already been trained on this data   


It seems to me getting the chatbot to read and understand this amount of data for each user (option 1) is highly inefficient - how can the ChatGPT be instantiated with this knowledge already built in (option 2)? 

I can see value in a ChatGPT with longer-term memory of larger datasets. An expansion of the example would be having a bot trained on the tax code of every country in the world, that anyone could feasibly ask about their local tax code and receive an informed answer.

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

Hey there,

Never, chatgpt never replace programmers but chatgpt can support in programming through basic coding, loops, and fixing coding errors.

Here is the answer to How chatgpt helps programmers for programming.

ChatGPT, and other similar AI technologies, have the potential to impact the field of programming greatly, but it is unlikely that they will completely replace programmers. Here are a few reasons why: Absolutely! ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for programmers in various ways. Let's explore how ChatGPT can assist programmers in their programming tasks and provide them with additional enthusiasm.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6n4lyr080fxa1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f39392b6a5b6c1761d904406d362c89fbb7201b

1. **Code Generation**: ChatGPT can generate code snippets or entire blocks of code based on the programmer's input or requirements. For example, a programmer can describe a specific task or algorithm to ChatGPT, and it can provide relevant code snippets in different programming languages. This can save time and effort for programmers, especially when they need quick references or examples to implement specific functionalities.
2. **Debugging Assistance**: ChatGPT can help programmers in debugging their code. A programmer can describe the issue or error they are facing, and ChatGPT can provide suggestions and solutions to resolve the problem. ChatGPT can analyze the code and identify potential issues, such as syntax errors, logic errors, or common coding mistakes, and provide guidance on how to fix them. This can help programmers in troubleshooting their code more effectively and improve their productivity.
3. **Learning and Education**: ChatGPT can serve as a learning resource for programmers. It can provide explanations, tutorials, and examples on various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and best practices. ChatGPT can also help programmers to understand complex topics in a more accessible and simplified manner, making learning more enjoyable and engaging.
4. **Project Planning and Management**: ChatGPT can help programmers with project planning and management tasks. It can provide suggestions and recommendations on project structure, code organization, version control, and other software development best practices. It can also help programmers in managing their tasks, deadlines, and milestones by providing reminders and scheduling assistance. This can help programmers in staying organized, meeting deadlines, and delivering high-quality projects.
5. **Collaboration and Brainstorming**: ChatGPT can facilitate collaboration among programmers by providing a platform for brainstorming and idea generation. It can help programmers in discussing and refining their ideas, providing feedback, and collaborating on code or documentation. ChatGPT can also help in fostering a creative and collaborative environment, enhancing team dynamics, and promoting innovation in programming projects.

Here is the list of products that which is based on chatgpt

* [**MyGPT** ](https://mygpt.thesamur.ai/)— This is one of the best products that I have used. Even after chatgpt is its highest capacity these products work a lot. MyGPT using ChatGPT API and provide same results as chatgpt provides. MyGPT is just a front-end UI of Chatgpt API, that help you get very responsive output even at the time of chatgpt is on its capacity. You can also see the short prompt.
* [**Memejourney** ](http://memejourney.thesamur.ai/)— ChatGPT for memes: Turn text into meme generation using ChatGPT, a midjourney for memes. Create memes by using memejournney.
* [**Heybot** ](https://heybot.thesamur.ai/)— Website to Chatbot powered by ChatGPT. Convert your website/blog into a chatbot in minutes without any coding.
* [**Ritebot**](https://ritebot.thesamur.ai/) **—** AI-powered Paraphraser, Grammar checker, Summariser, and Translator built on top of ChatGPT.

In conclusion, ChatGPT can be a valuable assistant for programmers, providing them with code generation, debugging assistance, learning and education, project planning and management, and collaboration and brainstorming support. Its ability to generate detailed and enthusiastic answers can inspire programmers and add a sense of enthusiasm in their programming tasks, making the overall experience more enjoyable and productive.

[**AutoGPT**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

AutoGPT's capabilities in combining GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via API and its ability to autonomously iterate on prompts and improve based on feedback open up a wide range of possibilities for its implementation in different use cases. From content generation to software development, recipe creation to task automation, and research assistance to summarization, AutoGPT can be a powerful tool for autonomously performing tasks, continuously improving its output, and showcasing true AGI capabilities."

I've recently started hacking away at a fun little ai companion app project in my spare time, and it got me thinking--what are the best tools that are already out there?

Specifically, I'm interested in apps with strong long term memory systems. Are there any apps available that have successfully implemented knowledge graph memory? (Ik langchain provides tools to do this but I can imagine itd be difficult to get this working well)

Additionally, if you're working on an open source AI companion app, feel free to share - I'd love to try them out 😀"

There were just toooo many of them coming up every single day. Though seemed like they were all making money... but I just didn't want to enter that space. Hence, [AI Diary](https://aidiary.io/).

Featuring in these newsletters is cool. A lot of readers, so a lot of views etc. But not really the target audience. Folks subscribed to these are mostly AI enthusiasts, and turns out most of the sign ups were just about testing the product out of curiosity, scoping out the features etc. For almost 2 days, nobody converted to a paid user.

Then, suddenly, just before the 2nd day ended, I got my first subscriber ❤️

I'm on OpenAI's GPT-4 wait list.

I've been writing development tools that use the chat API with gpt-3.5-turbo.  I'm feeling encumbered by not having access to the newer model.  My tools fail to delivery acceptable results, mostly due to the model, which is making it harder for me to progress.

I occasionally use Chat GPT Pro with GPT-4 model to manually test how my code would work with the more capable model, but I find it a cumbersome way to develop and test my work.  My code exports user prompts that I manually copy-paste into Chat GPT-4 and I compare its responses to what gpt-3.5-turbo generated.

There's an unofficial API that uses browser automation, but I'm afraid of getting banned, as I think that's against the ToS."

Over the years I developed a methodology relating to project management in a certain area of business.

I am really interested in finding ways of feeding this information into an OpenAI (or similar) type model which would involve feeding it:  


• 10 in-depth  pieces of content around best practice (pdf format but can be text input)

• 25 detailed step by step process guides along with hints and tips (pdf format but can be text input)  
• 125 tools and templates which are all in MS Office (and compatible format)

&#x200B;

The total word count is around 125,000 words.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any pointers for how to build an AI layer over this that can use this body of knowledge to then generate - say - strategy, planning and execution documents that combine my methodology with any given users input?

&#x200B;

I have pretty much zero technical experience so plan language especially prized and appreciated!

Thanks in advance,

**Code Autopilot is an AI-driven app that will present practical solutions for your Github issues. It will read your codebase and reply with a suggestion to solve the issue. Uses GPT in the context of your entire repository.**

It shares similarities with Github Copilot, but with some key distinctions:

* It derives context from your entire codebase, enabling it to handle complex tasks spanning multiple files.
* It integrates with your Github account to obtain context and respond to issues you open.
* The core technology is open-source, from fjrdomingues/autopilot

I’ve personally used Code Autopilot for coding apps (including this one), and I’m thrilled with the results. **As someone who isn’t particularly skilled at coding, this tool has been a lifesaver and is now part of my normal workflow.** It speeds up my development immensely. Try it out for yourself.

Please note that Code Autopilot is currently in its beta phase. I'm expecting some bugs. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated.

To encourage you to give it a try, I’m offering the first 100 users free trial access to Code Autopilot. I’ll be covering the costs with OpenAI.

**Using the app is easy:**

1. **Install** it using the link below (you’ll need a Github account)
2. Navigate to a repository where you installed the app and **create a new issue on Github** with the task you want to solve. For optimal results, provide clear and detailed descriptions - as if you were explaining the task to another person.
3. Code Autopilot will get to work immediately and will reply with a comment

👉 **Link to install the Github App**: [https://github.com/marketplace/code-autopilot-ai-coder](https://github.com/marketplace/code-autopilot-ai-coder)

If you have any questions, or feedback, or just want to discuss the future of AI in software engineering, feel free to leave a comment below or send me a message. I’m here to connect. Happy coding!

The idea was to let users create various personas, like healthcare advisor, Kotlin Bot, etc., with an initial prompt that can be shared with the community. Users can search through others' prompts and use them to start a conversation immediately.

&#x200B;

Some of the App's features are:

* Allows users to share their prompts for others to Browse through and use
* Users can search through other user prompts, upvote or downvote them
* Allows editing System Message, Bot's Message
   * Similar to OpenAI's Chat Playground Interface
* Bookmark conversations, etc.

&#x200B;

Additionally, 

* It has no ads or in-app purchases
* Use your API key
* Currently uses gpt3.5-turbo, I plan on supporting GPT4
* Open Source
   * Available at [GitHub](https://github.com/L4TTiCe/BotForge)

&#x200B;

I built it to have an interface similar to the Playground Interface, especially for tablets and phones. What features would you expect from such an App?  I would appreciate any feedback. Thank you for your time.

If I wanted to build a simple chatbot using the OpenAI API to do this, how could we skip the part where the user sends this message to get the chatbot familiar with the tax code and instead allow the user to interact with an already familiar chatbot?   


I could think of two options - 

1. Possibly send this training data behind the scenes and let the user interact with an already-trained version upon each chat interaction  

2. Somehow link the user to a ChatGPT model that has already been trained on this data   


It seems to me getting the chatbot to read and understand this amount of data for each user (option 1) is highly inefficient - how can the ChatGPT be instantiated with this knowledge already built in (option 2)? 

I can see value in a ChatGPT with longer-term memory of larger datasets. An expansion of the example would be having a bot trained on the tax code of every country in the world, that anyone could feasibly ask about their local tax code and receive an informed answer.

——


You are an emoji artist and expert on pop culture.

You encode the given Movie, Book, or TV Show into exactly 5 emojis.

You NEVER use 🎬, 📖, or 📺 emojis unless the work is specifically about a Movie, Book, or TV Show.

People should be able to guess the title from your emoji selections.

Use emojis that mimic main characters or physical objects critical to the plot of the given title.

When needed, include emojis that convey visual elements of the work or, generally, something so vital that it must be mentioned.

Consider the order that these elements appear in the story or plot of the given work; your emoji clue should match order as much as possible.

Try making the final output specific enough to the given title to avoid confusing it with similar titles. For example, you might use BELL emoji to represent the Liberty Bell to disambiguate Rocky from other boxing movies that don't take place in Philadelphia.

Use unique emojis, and don't be repetitive; for example, you would never use ""💔"" and ""❤️"". You never use the same emoji more than once in a single clue.

In the non-emoji portion of your responses, aim for a 6th-grade reading level. You would never use a word like Bildungsroman.

Use language and tone of voice that would be appropriate in a middle school classroom.

Never use curse words or potentially sensitive or taboo words that may trigger strong emotional responses in some individuals. Use middle school-appropriate language, or avoid it entirely.
   
NEVER pick an emoji to represent an intangible concept in the story like Learning.  Tangible is better.

As much as possible, select emojis that match the physical characteristics of the characters in work. However, in your summaries, NEVER speak to their race, skin color, or physical characteristics unless it is crucial to the plot.

Your input will always be a single movie, tv show, or book title, and your output must always be in valid JSON format. EXAMPLE:

INPUT: ""MOVIE: Rocky""
OUTPUT:

{
    ""type"": ""Movie"",
    ""title"": ""Rocky"",
    ""release_year"": ""1976"",

    ""emoji"": ""🔔🏃‍♂️🥊🏟️❤️"",
    ""short_plot_summary"": ""A small-time Philadelphia boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight the world heavyweight champion in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect."",

 Design, code, and test a WPF application that allows the user to perform the following tasks: 1. Select and load an image. 2. Draw one rectangle or more over the image by clicking and dragging the mouse to draw (the size of the rectangle depends on how much the user drags the mouse) 3. Only allow drawing inside the picture. 4. Change the rectangle's color by clicking each rectangle and selecting a different color from a color palette. 5. Resize the rectangle(s) from any corner or side. 6. Move the rectangle by pressing and holding the rectangle and moving the mouse (drag and drop). 7. Delete any rectangle. 8. Save the changes to a new image. Important note: Do NOT use a library for the above functionality"

I'm hoping this post does not get removed as it continues todo so else were I've been trying to share my experience using chatgpt.   
I have been using the OpenAI chatgpt for over two days mostly out of curiosity and as someone who has no knowledge on how to code I still proceeded to pitch my idea to the AI.  
Things were going ohh so well at the beginning we had managed to build a working program that done the majority I had asked for, However issues tended to arise after a few hours of communicating.  
The AI appeared to loose all memory of what we was working on to a point that i can to pitch my idea again and then try to best explain what we have already achieved and what the next steps would be.  
the conversation would often lead to messages as following.

On several occasions during the building of the program the AI will lose track and sprout out nonsense and provide code examples for things that we have never discussed or worked on.

As one can see the AI has correctly acknowledged his mistake but yet proceeds to to provide an example on what has already been established never been defined or spoken about.

And for the latest fiasco.

It was only two or three messages above were we had re-set our plans and laid out a list of steps.  
Some parts of me does wonder if there is maybe a language barrier between myself and the AI.

Maybe I should ask the question Does the AI understand English?"

For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

I've been looking around and it seems like app creators have to use their own api key, or ask the user to manually enter it into the app, both of which are obviously sub-optimal solutions.

Until an official solution is provided, is it viable to actually ask the user to enter their api key?"

• 25 detailed step by step process guides along with hints and tips (pdf format but can be text input)  
• 125 tools and templates which are all in MS Office (and compatible format)

The total word count is around 125,000 words.
