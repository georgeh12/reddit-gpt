I have a couple of friends who run pretty successful Ecomm sites (fashion accessories) and noticed they spend about 90 minutes a day answering repetitive questions to their customers on their website and social. Example - where's my order? What's your return policy? Etc. So i just took the leap and built out something that uses OpenAI and can help answer these product / order queries very quickly.

Here's a prototype I built for Allbirds: [https://app.getmacha.com/chat/allbirds](https://app.getmacha.com/chat/allbirds) (desktop only). Ask it anything about their products, policies etc.

Of course i discussed this ""leap"" with my partner and she's quite supportive; but am obviously scared sh\*tless because of the implications this might have on my life. Good decision? Stupid decision? Does the problem even exist?

I know Gorgias and Zendesk exist but we've built this specifically for ecomm stores and do a bit more than what these apps have to offer.

Also, please put me in touch with folks who could help me test this out :) Thanks for reading my nervous rant."

Hey there,

Never, chatgpt never replace programmers but chatgpt can support in programming through basic coding, loops, and fixing coding errors.

Here is the answer to How chatgpt helps programmers for programming.

ChatGPT, and other similar AI technologies, have the potential to impact the field of programming greatly, but it is unlikely that they will completely replace programmers. Here are a few reasons why: Absolutely! ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for programmers in various ways. Let's explore how ChatGPT can assist programmers in their programming tasks and provide them with additional enthusiasm.

1. **Code Generation**: ChatGPT can generate code snippets or entire blocks of code based on the programmer's input or requirements. For example, a programmer can describe a specific task or algorithm to ChatGPT, and it can provide relevant code snippets in different programming languages. This can save time and effort for programmers, especially when they need quick references or examples to implement specific functionalities.
2. **Debugging Assistance**: ChatGPT can help programmers in debugging their code. A programmer can describe the issue or error they are facing, and ChatGPT can provide suggestions and solutions to resolve the problem. ChatGPT can analyze the code and identify potential issues, such as syntax errors, logic errors, or common coding mistakes, and provide guidance on how to fix them. This can help programmers in troubleshooting their code more effectively and improve their productivity.
3. **Learning and Education**: ChatGPT can serve as a learning resource for programmers. It can provide explanations, tutorials, and examples on various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and best practices. ChatGPT can also help programmers to understand complex topics in a more accessible and simplified manner, making learning more enjoyable and engaging.
4. **Project Planning and Management**: ChatGPT can help programmers with project planning and management tasks. It can provide suggestions and recommendations on project structure, code organization, version control, and other software development best practices. It can also help programmers in managing their tasks, deadlines, and milestones by providing reminders and scheduling assistance. This can help programmers in staying organized, meeting deadlines, and delivering high-quality projects.
5. **Collaboration and Brainstorming**: ChatGPT can facilitate collaboration among programmers by providing a platform for brainstorming and idea generation. It can help programmers in discussing and refining their ideas, providing feedback, and collaborating on code or documentation. ChatGPT can also help in fostering a creative and collaborative environment, enhancing team dynamics, and promoting innovation in programming projects.

* [**Ritebot**](https://ritebot.thesamur.ai/) **—** AI-powered Paraphraser, Grammar checker, Summariser, and Translator built on top of ChatGPT.

In conclusion, ChatGPT can be a valuable assistant for programmers, providing them with code generation, debugging assistance, learning and education, project planning and management, and collaboration and brainstorming support. Its ability to generate detailed and enthusiastic answers can inspire programmers and add a sense of enthusiasm in their programming tasks, making the overall experience more enjoyable and productive.

[**AutoGPT**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

AutoGPT's capabilities in combining GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via API and its ability to autonomously iterate on prompts and improve based on feedback open up a wide range of possibilities for its implementation in different use cases. From content generation to software development, recipe creation to task automation, and research assistance to summarization, AutoGPT can be a powerful tool for autonomously performing tasks, continuously improving its output, and showcasing true AGI capabilities."

I'm using ChatGPT as the programmer to my systems analysis role. Having been on the programming side, I can't help but start to feel bad asking for the fourth or fifth change. I find myself getting sheepish and even telling ChatGPT that I'm sorry. Weird I know but I even ask Chat how it's going at the beginning of a chat session. Compulsive behavior.

Anyway, this is a text-based javascript golf game that ChatGPT and I put together in about five hours so far.  I estimate 80 percent of the credit goes to ChatGPT. ChatGPT even came up with the name. 

I don't know that I ever would have figured out the code for the swing meter that Chat spit out in five seconds.  Very cool technique. Feel free to look at/borrow the code. 

I'm still messing around with the game but I think it plays pretty well. I'm going to add a few display ads but doubt it will generate meaningful revenue.

-----------------------

Welcome to Green Glory Golf, where your digital golf skills are put to the test. 

The Basics: Aim to hit the ball as close to the hole as possible with each swing. Your progress is measured in yards, and swing timing is crucial. Each hole has a different distance (100 to 600 yards) and par (2, 3, or 4), offering varying challenges. Click ""Swing!"" when the moving yellow bar is closest to the right end of the green bar for maximum distance.

Tips for Success: Master timing by watching the yellow bar's movement. Keep an eye on your overall score and adjust your strategy.

Practice to become a Green Glory Golf master. 

Happy Swinging!

**Code Autopilot is an AI-driven app that will present practical solutions for your Github issues. It will read your codebase and reply with a suggestion to solve the issue. Uses GPT in the context of your entire repository.**

It shares similarities with Github Copilot, but with some key distinctions:

* It derives context from your entire codebase, enabling it to handle complex tasks spanning multiple files.
* It integrates with your Github account to obtain context and respond to issues you open.
* The core technology is open-source, from fjrdomingues/autopilot

I’ve personally used Code Autopilot for coding apps (including this one), and I’m thrilled with the results. **As someone who isn’t particularly skilled at coding, this tool has been a lifesaver and is now part of my normal workflow.** It speeds up my development immensely. Try it out for yourself.

Please note that Code Autopilot is currently in its beta phase. I'm expecting some bugs. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated.

To encourage you to give it a try, I’m offering the first 100 users free trial access to Code Autopilot. I’ll be covering the costs with OpenAI.

**Using the app is easy:**

1. **Install** it using the link below (you’ll need a Github account)
2. Navigate to a repository where you installed the app and **create a new issue on Github** with the task you want to solve. For optimal results, provide clear and detailed descriptions - as if you were explaining the task to another person.
3. Code Autopilot will get to work immediately and will reply with a comment
