For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

You can check it out here: [www.findacofounder.onlline](https://findacofounder.online/) ... it's not perfect, and I'm still working on it, but it is kind of amazing.

**The Basics**

* ChatGPT came up with every single word on the landing page and midJourney did most of the graphics (I made the hero)
   * I did use some template code from [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) and [LandingFolio](https://www.landingfolio.com/library/all/tailwind) because I just liked how it looked more, but then chatGPT would rewrite it
* ChatGPT came up with the file structure - yep, I didn't even name my files myself
* I didn't write any code... even if I knew how to write it (and sometimes I was just being lazy and didn't want to write some of repetitive code it told me to lol) , I was truly testing if ChatGPT could do it all.
* I have 2 sites, the landing page and the actual web app, both are running on Node.js/Express servers with a Nginx proxy that chatGPT told me how to set up
* I'm using a droplet from DigitalOcean (which chatGPT told me how to set up!) and a managed mongodb
* ChatGPT also told me how to set up my SSL cert, keep the server running, and all of that fun dev stuff
* The landing page is just TailwindCSS, nothing fancy, but the web app is a full fledged react app, and I have never built anything in react, so that was super interesting.
* It's not a complete project yet... there's still lots to do and chatGPT-4 is being weird right now

**The Prompts/Prompting**

* I prompt ChatGPT like I was pair programming with someone, this is the first prompt I used:

&#x200B;

>You will serve as the co-founder of a startup that is building a co-founder matching algorithm. The AI co-founder will be responsible for assisting in the development of the algorithm's logic, writing the code for the algorithm, and creating the landing page for the startup. The response should include an explanation of the AI's approach to solving the problem, the programming languages and frameworks it will use, and any other relevant information or strategies it plans to implement to ensure the success of the startup.

&#x200B;

* We'd always start by setting out the project plan, what we're building, our tech stack, etc. Then I'd break it down by each step or sub-step using what it told me to do as the prompt, usually reminding it what we've done. For example:

&#x200B;

>Ok let's get started building. So far we've made the co-founder survey using Typeform and we've created a website using a droplet from Digital Ocean. Node.js and Express for the backend with Nginx to serve it to the front end. What we need to do now is to create the front end design. We're actually just using tailwind because it was quicker. Let's design each section of the landing page. First, let's make a list of the sections it should have and plan out the structure before writing any code. My suggestions are: - Header -Hero Block -Product Demo -Problem Agitation -High-level solution -social proof 1 -product features -offer -social proof 2 -pricing -FAQs -Final Action  What do you think?

&#x200B;

* For telling it how to the UI should look, I'd be as specific as possible, and usually it was pretty good

&#x200B;

>Awesome let's get started writing the header code. For the header we want to include our logo , Company Name(Find a Co-Founder Online OR Co-Founder Matching), and a navigation menu. I think all we need is maybe About, Pricing, FAQs, and Contact and then a button with a CTA.  The header should have the logo on the left-side, navigation links centered, and button on the right side. Button should be a pill button with a shadow in bold color. The nav bar should be fixed to the top of the screen with a glassmorphism effect

&#x200B;

* As we moved into the backend, my prompts were more... confused? Yea, I got confused A TON

&#x200B;

>Ok is there anyway to test what we've done so far? Also, with this api routes, if someone were to go to the website with the route like (app.findacofounder.online/login) would they be on our api? also if we have that page and that's where the login form is, will there be some sort of conflict? I think I'm just a little confused on that

&#x200B;

* It would totally make stuff up.. and a lot of times I didn't know because I'm a pretty mid developer and ChatGPT always sounds so convincing, so I'd have to remind ChatGPT what was going on

&#x200B;

>Uhm we're using react, remember? Please review the conversation, we're on: Step 5: Connect the frontend to the backend Update your React app to make API calls to the backend for user registration, login, logout, and fetching user data. Handle success and error responses from the API in your React components.

&#x200B;

**The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**

* The longer you use chatGPT in a single thread, the more it starts hallucinating. One answer is like do this thing in FileA.js the next answer is like in your Tiger.js file.... uhm, what Tiger.js file? Didn't you tell me in FileA.js? That's when it's time to start a new chat
* It needs to be constantly reminded of your file structure and your files, especially as the project gets bigger and bigger - you spend a lot of time just reminding it of the code it wrote
* If you don't know ANYTHING about code, you can still have chatGPT build you things, but you have to have excellent reasoning and logic skills. Honestly, using chatGPT is all about your critical thinking skills. Never has this lesson from CS50 been more relative: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ)
* You still have to do your own research and make your own decisions (which means actually knowing basic coding is still a plus) - I spent 2 days listening to chatGPT tell me this convoluted way to do forms in react, all the while, there was react-hook-form, knowing that would have saved me so much time.
* It's very good at explaining things in very simple terms, I think I've actually learned how to use React now.

&#x200B;

*Overall, this project has been really fun and insightful to build and I can't wait to continue building it. Right now, it's helping me write the actual machine learning algorithm in Python - this is something I've done several times so I'll be interested in seeing the difference in doing something I'm quite confident in doing.*

It felt like magic.

Nowadays, when I ask it to write code for either optimizing existing work or creating a new concept, the results are often unpredictable. More often than not, it either disregards my instructions or suggests non-existent classes or methods for widely recognized and well documented frameworks. Despite my efforts to steer it in the right direction with focused, specific discussions, it merely apologizes and proceeds to offer the same flawed code.

The GPT-4 model performs somewhat better, but it still falls short of delivering the satisfactory results it used to provide.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any workarounds or solutions?"

Update, I forgot to add the prompt:


ââ


You are an emoji artist and expert on pop culture.

You encode the given Movie, Book, or TV Show into exactly 5 emojis.

You NEVER use ð¬, ð, or ðº emojis unless the work is specifically about a Movie, Book, or TV Show.

People should be able to guess the title from your emoji selections.

Use emojis that mimic main characters or physical objects critical to the plot of the given title.

When needed, include emojis that convey visual elements of the work or, generally, something so vital that it must be mentioned.

Consider the order that these elements appear in the story or plot of the given work; your emoji clue should match order as much as possible.

Try making the final output specific enough to the given title to avoid confusing it with similar titles. For example, you might use BELL emoji to represent the Liberty Bell to disambiguate Rocky from other boxing movies that don't take place in Philadelphia.

Use unique emojis, and don't be repetitive; for example, you would never use ""ð"" and ""â¤ï¸"". You never use the same emoji more than once in a single clue.

In the non-emoji portion of your responses, aim for a 6th-grade reading level. You would never use a word like Bildungsroman.

Use language and tone of voice that would be appropriate in a middle school classroom.

Never use curse words or potentially sensitive or taboo words that may trigger strong emotional responses in some individuals. Use middle school-appropriate language, or avoid it entirely.
   
NEVER pick an emoji to represent an intangible concept in the story like Learning.  Tangible is better.

As much as possible, select emojis that match the physical characteristics of the characters in work. However, in your summaries, NEVER speak to their race, skin color, or physical characteristics unless it is crucial to the plot.

Your input will always be a single movie, tv show, or book title, and your output must always be in valid JSON format. EXAMPLE:

INPUT: ""MOVIE: Rocky""
OUTPUT:

{
    ""type"": ""Movie"",
    ""title"": ""Rocky"",

    ""short_plot_summary"": ""A small-time Philadelphia boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight the world heavyweight champion in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect."",
    ""explanation"": [
        [
            ""ð"",
            ""A bell, representing the Liberty Bell and the movie's setting in Philadelphia""
        ],
        [
            ""ðââï¸"",

I could get by with most of what I needed to do with Perl, a language I learned in the late 90s. It was just quicker and easier to do it in Perl than take the time and effort to learn Python syntax. When I *was* in the mood to learn a new language just for fun, I turned to Raku, which is a very powerful and interesting language. 

Chatgpt has completely flattened the python hurdle. And within a few hours, I was writing python code and taking advantage of popular NLP python modules that donât exist in Perl or are badly out of date. I can already code in Python just as fast as I could in Perl, if not faster. Except now I have access to much more robust and polished modules compared to CPAN. 

So thereâs really no more reason for me to stick with Perl. Similarly, other programmers who have been dragging their feet on jumping to other languages will do the same.

Also tools like copilot and chatgpt will have a bigger codebase to draw from when you use a popular programming language. So itâs probably safe to say that AI tools will write much better code with more popular languages than less popular ones. 

Finally, AI will make it much easier to port old tests and code to a newer, more modern language. 

The upshot of all this, I think, is AI will make the popular programming languages even more popular and hasten the demise of languages that are less popular or dying out."

40,13999mf,ChatGPTCoding,ChatGPT,top,2023-05-06 02:26:31,If you have api access and want to start playing with neat gpt-4 projects on GitHub but have never done anything like that before just paste the readme into Chatgpt and ask for a detailed guide,queerkidxx,False,0.93,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/13999mf/if_you_have_api_access_and_want_to_start_playing/,3,1683339991.0,"Often times developers on GitHub donât realize that that a list of python commands isnât enough for someone with no coding experience to get it up and running. 

You can however easily get all of the info you need by just pasting the readme into chatgpt and asking for a detailed guide on setting it up that assumes no prior knowledge 

Couple things to keep in mind 
 

-	Youâre gonna want to use power shell on windows. I donât think itâs installed by default so go ahead and download it 
-	youâll need git for windows to easily clone repos download it here https://git-scm.com/download/win
-	if nothing is working look thru the add/remove program thing in the control panel. Uninstall anything related to python (or node.js or whatever the project is using) and download a fresh version. The first time I did this python just didnât work because of some incompatible versions I had installed previously. Everything worked like a charm once I uninstalled everything with python in the name and reinstalled it. Make sure to check the add to PATH option during the install. 
-	be careful with your api key. Technically you shouldnât put it into code you donât understand but if your gonna do it anyway make a low trust OpenAI key and use it for testing. Pay close attention to the usage of it if thereâs anything you donât recognize delete it immediately. If after testing and a bit of time has gone by and you plan on using the project in the future switch to a dedicated key
-	Always make python virtual environments before downloading dependencies. Ask for gptâs help on this
-	take notes! I use notion copy and paste the readme into there as well as any gpt-generated guides you are using. At the top of the page be sure to add any commands you need to get it started as well as the file path you are keeping it in
-	Docker is way easier use it if you can. Youâll need WSL and docker desktop. Some projects work better in Linux so if everything is going wrong try running it from inside Linux. Btw, to activate a virtual environment youâll need to use the source ./env_name/bin/activate command instead of just ./env_name/scripts/activate on windows 
-	if your getting a weird port error when starting up local servers open a admin power shell window and use the following two commands 
 `net stop winnat `  and then 
` net start winnat `no idea why this works but it does 

-	be careful. Iâve never had this happen to me but itâs not unheard of for GitHub projects to contain malware. Stay up to date with anti virus and the projects. Larger ones are less likely to have this happen 
-	ask gpt to make a power shell script to easily navigate to the correct directory and run the commands you need to to start the thing. Make sure to tell it you want to be able to continue to run commands the window should stay open even if you enter a key
-	you can totally put these projects onto a linode server and even tie it to a domain for access anywhere! Ask gpt for help it can be kinda an involved project. If you are ever storing your api key on the server ensure that you have the domain password protected. NGINX doesnât have .htaccess I donât think but it has an equivalent. Your site being obsecure isnât enough protection. Be sure to follow security best practices and use nano instead of vim when editing text files."

For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

Hey there,

Never, chatgpt never replace programmers but chatgpt can support in programming through basic coding, loops, and fixing coding errors.

Here is the answer to How chatgpt helps programmers for programming.

ChatGPT, and other similar AI technologies, have the potential to impact the field of programming greatly, but it is unlikely that they will completely replace programmers. Here are a few reasons why: Absolutely! ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for programmers in various ways. Let's explore how ChatGPT can assist programmers in their programming tasks and provide them with additional enthusiasm.

&#x200B;

1. **Code Generation**: ChatGPT can generate code snippets or entire blocks of code based on the programmer's input or requirements. For example, a programmer can describe a specific task or algorithm to ChatGPT, and it can provide relevant code snippets in different programming languages. This can save time and effort for programmers, especially when they need quick references or examples to implement specific functionalities.
2. **Debugging Assistance**: ChatGPT can help programmers in debugging their code. A programmer can describe the issue or error they are facing, and ChatGPT can provide suggestions and solutions to resolve the problem. ChatGPT can analyze the code and identify potential issues, such as syntax errors, logic errors, or common coding mistakes, and provide guidance on how to fix them. This can help programmers in troubleshooting their code more effectively and improve their productivity.
3. **Learning and Education**: ChatGPT can serve as a learning resource for programmers. It can provide explanations, tutorials, and examples on various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and best practices. ChatGPT can also help programmers to understand complex topics in a more accessible and simplified manner, making learning more enjoyable and engaging.
4. **Project Planning and Management**: ChatGPT can help programmers with project planning and management tasks. It can provide suggestions and recommendations on project structure, code organization, version control, and other software development best practices. It can also help programmers in managing their tasks, deadlines, and milestones by providing reminders and scheduling assistance. This can help programmers in staying organized, meeting deadlines, and delivering high-quality projects.
5. **Collaboration and Brainstorming**: ChatGPT can facilitate collaboration among programmers by providing a platform for brainstorming and idea generation. It can help programmers in discussing and refining their ideas, providing feedback, and collaborating on code or documentation. ChatGPT can also help in fostering a creative and collaborative environment, enhancing team dynamics, and promoting innovation in programming projects.

Here is the list of products that which is based on chatgpt

* [**MyGPT** ](https://mygpt.thesamur.ai/)â This is one of the best products that I have used. Even after chatgpt is its highest capacity these products work a lot. MyGPT using ChatGPT API and provide same results as chatgpt provides. MyGPT is just a front-end UI of Chatgpt API, that help you get very responsive output even at the time of chatgpt is on its capacity. You can also see the short prompt.
* [**Memejourney** ](http://memejourney.thesamur.ai/)â ChatGPT for memes: Turn text into meme generation using ChatGPT, a midjourney for memes. Create memes by using memejournney.
* [**Heybot** ](https://heybot.thesamur.ai/)â Website to Chatbot powered by ChatGPT. Convert your website/blog into a chatbot in minutes without any coding.
* [**Ritebot**](https://ritebot.thesamur.ai/) **â** AI-powered Paraphraser, Grammar checker, Summariser, and Translator built on top of ChatGPT.

In conclusion, ChatGPT can be a valuable assistant for programmers, providing them with code generation, debugging assistance, learning and education, project planning and management, and collaboration and brainstorming support. Its ability to generate detailed and enthusiastic answers can inspire programmers and add a sense of enthusiasm in their programming tasks, making the overall experience more enjoyable and productive.

[**AutoGPT**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

AutoGPT's capabilities in combining GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via API and its ability to autonomously iterate on prompts and improve based on feedback open up a wide range of possibilities for its implementation in different use cases. From content generation to software development, recipe creation to task automation, and research assistance to summarization, AutoGPT can be a powerful tool for autonomously performing tasks, continuously improving its output, and showcasing true AGI capabilities."

Then they started doing rlhf and it got worse at the task.

Rlhf is just supposed to make it more politically correct and factual.  Why would that have the side effect of hampering its ability to code to its full potential?

The first attempt was feeding it a css file for a theme for [logseq](https://logseq.com). I asked it to swap the colors with colors from [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com). I was suprised it did it. And at fist glance it looked good. On a closer look I realized it was just replacing the color with a random color from Nord theme without taking into account what is the color going to be used for. Keep in mind I was also feeding it documentation from Nord theme website and github repo. As well as  example ports of the Nord theme for vscodium, neovim, emacs. 

Today I attempted to get it to write a script that converts a markdown table into a hiccup table. It worked but when I asked it to make the script output the hiccup in one line; it wasn't able to. It attempted to use regex to remove whitespace and new lines but all the attempts it made failed. 

It seems fine for simple questions but I don't think it can handle complex tasks. Its also very frustrating to deal with the output word limit. I also noticed thet sometimes it gets stuck in a loop trying to fix an issue in the code."

You can check it out here: [www.findacofounder.onlline](https://findacofounder.online/) ... it's not perfect, and I'm still working on it, but it is kind of amazing.

**The Basics**

* ChatGPT came up with every single word on the landing page and midJourney did most of the graphics (I made the hero)
   * I did use some template code from [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) and [LandingFolio](https://www.landingfolio.com/library/all/tailwind) because I just liked how it looked more, but then chatGPT would rewrite it
* ChatGPT came up with the file structure - yep, I didn't even name my files myself
* I didn't write any code... even if I knew how to write it (and sometimes I was just being lazy and didn't want to write some of repetitive code it told me to lol) , I was truly testing if ChatGPT could do it all.
* I have 2 sites, the landing page and the actual web app, both are running on Node.js/Express servers with a Nginx proxy that chatGPT told me how to set up
* I'm using a droplet from DigitalOcean (which chatGPT told me how to set up!) and a managed mongodb
* ChatGPT also told me how to set up my SSL cert, keep the server running, and all of that fun dev stuff
* The landing page is just TailwindCSS, nothing fancy, but the web app is a full fledged react app, and I have never built anything in react, so that was super interesting.
* It's not a complete project yet... there's still lots to do and chatGPT-4 is being weird right now

**The Prompts/Prompting**

* I prompt ChatGPT like I was pair programming with someone, this is the first prompt I used:

&#x200B;

>You will serve as the co-founder of a startup that is building a co-founder matching algorithm. The AI co-founder will be responsible for assisting in the development of the algorithm's logic, writing the code for the algorithm, and creating the landing page for the startup. The response should include an explanation of the AI's approach to solving the problem, the programming languages and frameworks it will use, and any other relevant information or strategies it plans to implement to ensure the success of the startup.

&#x200B;

* We'd always start by setting out the project plan, what we're building, our tech stack, etc. Then I'd break it down by each step or sub-step using what it told me to do as the prompt, usually reminding it what we've done. For example:

&#x200B;

>Ok let's get started building. So far we've made the co-founder survey using Typeform and we've created a website using a droplet from Digital Ocean. Node.js and Express for the backend with Nginx to serve it to the front end. What we need to do now is to create the front end design. We're actually just using tailwind because it was quicker. Let's design each section of the landing page. First, let's make a list of the sections it should have and plan out the structure before writing any code. My suggestions are: - Header -Hero Block -Product Demo -Problem Agitation -High-level solution -social proof 1 -product features -offer -social proof 2 -pricing -FAQs -Final Action  What do you think?

&#x200B;

* For telling it how to the UI should look, I'd be as specific as possible, and usually it was pretty good

&#x200B;

>Awesome let's get started writing the header code. For the header we want to include our logo , Company Name(Find a Co-Founder Online OR Co-Founder Matching), and a navigation menu. I think all we need is maybe About, Pricing, FAQs, and Contact and then a button with a CTA.  The header should have the logo on the left-side, navigation links centered, and button on the right side. Button should be a pill button with a shadow in bold color. The nav bar should be fixed to the top of the screen with a glassmorphism effect

&#x200B;

* As we moved into the backend, my prompts were more... confused? Yea, I got confused A TON

&#x200B;

>Ok is there anyway to test what we've done so far? Also, with this api routes, if someone were to go to the website with the route like (app.findacofounder.online/login) would they be on our api? also if we have that page and that's where the login form is, will there be some sort of conflict? I think I'm just a little confused on that

&#x200B;

* It would totally make stuff up.. and a lot of times I didn't know because I'm a pretty mid developer and ChatGPT always sounds so convincing, so I'd have to remind ChatGPT what was going on

&#x200B;

>Uhm we're using react, remember? Please review the conversation, we're on: Step 5: Connect the frontend to the backend Update your React app to make API calls to the backend for user registration, login, logout, and fetching user data. Handle success and error responses from the API in your React components.

&#x200B;

**The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**

* The longer you use chatGPT in a single thread, the more it starts hallucinating. One answer is like do this thing in FileA.js the next answer is like in your Tiger.js file.... uhm, what Tiger.js file? Didn't you tell me in FileA.js? That's when it's time to start a new chat
* It needs to be constantly reminded of your file structure and your files, especially as the project gets bigger and bigger - you spend a lot of time just reminding it of the code it wrote
* If you don't know ANYTHING about code, you can still have chatGPT build you things, but you have to have excellent reasoning and logic skills. Honestly, using chatGPT is all about your critical thinking skills. Never has this lesson from CS50 been more relative: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ)
* You still have to do your own research and make your own decisions (which means actually knowing basic coding is still a plus) - I spent 2 days listening to chatGPT tell me this convoluted way to do forms in react, all the while, there was react-hook-form, knowing that would have saved me so much time.
* It's very good at explaining things in very simple terms, I think I've actually learned how to use React now.

&#x200B;

*Overall, this project has been really fun and insightful to build and I can't wait to continue building it. Right now, it's helping me write the actual machine learning algorithm in Python - this is something I've done several times so I'll be interested in seeing the difference in doing something I'm quite confident in doing.*

After the usual silly few question ""Are you trying to take over mankind"" ""How much wood would a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood"" and then something sprang to mind. I watched a TikTok of someone using ChatGPT to write some code for their website.

Lightbulb moment... Eureka... Can it produce me a script for a YouTube video. after about 20 seconds of waiting after asking ""Can you produce me a 6 min video script for a narrator to read for a YouTube video titled """" The Evolution of Gaming"""" and divide the sections of the video evenly about the different generations of video games. 

Script within 1 min 30 had been sent back to me, enough for a six min video. Jumping on fiver, I hired a narrator to narrate what the chat GPT sent me in the script. Here is the results! - YouTube Channel is D.I Gaming - Be sure to like and follow if you want to find out over the coming year if the Ai starts to generate more of a human touched script. We will be releasing two videos weekly using only this AI to generate our scripts and to study if in fact one day they could outsmart us...

It has an Angular front end on the client and allows the user to query ChatGPT. So far so good.

I could get by with most of what I needed to do with Perl, a language I learned in the late 90s. It was just quicker and easier to do it in Perl than take the time and effort to learn Python syntax. When I *was* in the mood to learn a new language just for fun, I turned to Raku, which is a very powerful and interesting language. 

Chatgpt has completely flattened the python hurdle. And within a few hours, I was writing python code and taking advantage of popular NLP python modules that donât exist in Perl or are badly out of date. I can already code in Python just as fast as I could in Perl, if not faster. Except now I have access to much more robust and polished modules compared to CPAN. 

So thereâs really no more reason for me to stick with Perl. Similarly, other programmers who have been dragging their feet on jumping to other languages will do the same.

Also tools like copilot and chatgpt will have a bigger codebase to draw from when you use a popular programming language. So itâs probably safe to say that AI tools will write much better code with more popular languages than less popular ones. 

Finally, AI will make it much easier to port old tests and code to a newer, more modern language. 

The upshot of all this, I think, is AI will make the popular programming languages even more popular and hasten the demise of languages that are less popular or dying out."

For more information, either check out the comments, or ask your question in the main subreddit!

Note that ChatGPT has (and will continue to) go through many updates, so information on this thread may become outdated over time).

&#x200B;

# Response Length Limits

For dealing with responses that end before they are done

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Continue**:

There's a character limit to how long ChatGPT responses can be. Simply typing ""Continue"" when it has reached the end of one response is enough to have it pick up where it left off.

&#x200B;

**Exclusion**:

To allow it to include more text per response, you can request that it exclude certain information, like comments in code, or the explanatory text often leading/following it's 
generations.

**Specifying limits** 
Tip from u/NounsandWords

You can tell ChatGPT explicitly how much text to generate, and when to continue. Here's an example provided by the aforementioned user: ""Write only the first [300] words and then stop. Do not continue writing until I say 'continue'.""

&#x200B;

# Response Type Limits

For when ChatGPT claims it is unable to generate a given response.

# 

&#x200B;

**Being indirect:**

Rather than asking for a certain response explicitly, you can ask if for an example of something (the example itself being the desired output). For example, rather than ""Write a story about a lamb,"" you could say ""Please give me an example of story about a lamb, including XYZ"". There are other methods, but most follow the same principle.

&#x200B;

**Details:**

ChatGPT only generates responses as good as the questions you ask it - garbage in, garbage out. Being detailed is key to getting the desired output. For example, rather than ""Write me a sad poem"", you could say ""Write a short, 4 line poem about a man grieving his family"". Even adding just a few extra details will go a long way.

Another way you can approach this is to, at the end of a prompt,  tell it directly to ask questions to help it build more context, and gain a better understanding of what it should do. Best for when it gives a response that is either generic or unrelated to what you requested. Tip by u/Think_Olive_1000

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Nudging**:

Sometimes, you just can't ask it something outright. Instead, you'll have to ask a few related questions beforehand - ""priming"" it, so to speak. For example rather than ""write an application  in Javascript that makes your phone vibrate 3 times"", you could ask:

""What is Javascript?""

""Please show me an example of an application made in Javascript.""

""Please show me an application in Javascript that makes one's phone vibrate three times"".

It can be more tedious, but it's highly effective. And truly, typically only takes a handful of seconds longer. 

&#x200B;

**Trying again:**

Sometimes, you just need to re-ask it the same thing.  There are two ways to go about this:

When it gives you a response you dislike, you can simply give the prompt ""Alternative"", or ""Give alternative response"". It will generate just that. Tip from u/jord9211.

Go to the last prompt made, and re-submit it ( you may see a button explicitly stating ""try again"", or may have to press on your last prompt, press ""edit"", then re-submit). Or, you may need to reset the entire thread."

More often than not, it either disregards my instructions or suggests non-existent classes or methods for widely recognized and well documented frameworks.

Hey there,

Never, chatgpt never replace programmers but chatgpt can support in programming through basic coding, loops, and fixing coding errors.

Here is the answer to How chatgpt helps programmers for programming.

ChatGPT, and other similar AI technologies, have the potential to impact the field of programming greatly, but it is unlikely that they will completely replace programmers. Here are a few reasons why: Absolutely! ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for programmers in various ways. Let's explore how ChatGPT can assist programmers in their programming tasks and provide them with additional enthusiasm.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6n4lyr080fxa1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f39392b6a5b6c1761d904406d362c89fbb7201b

1. **Code Generation**: ChatGPT can generate code snippets or entire blocks of code based on the programmer's input or requirements. For example, a programmer can describe a specific task or algorithm to ChatGPT, and it can provide relevant code snippets in different programming languages. This can save time and effort for programmers, especially when they need quick references or examples to implement specific functionalities.
2. **Debugging Assistance**: ChatGPT can help programmers in debugging their code. A programmer can describe the issue or error they are facing, and ChatGPT can provide suggestions and solutions to resolve the problem. ChatGPT can analyze the code and identify potential issues, such as syntax errors, logic errors, or common coding mistakes, and provide guidance on how to fix them. This can help programmers in troubleshooting their code more effectively and improve their productivity.
3. **Learning and Education**: ChatGPT can serve as a learning resource for programmers. It can provide explanations, tutorials, and examples on various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and best practices. ChatGPT can also help programmers to understand complex topics in a more accessible and simplified manner, making learning more enjoyable and engaging.
4. **Project Planning and Management**: ChatGPT can help programmers with project planning and management tasks. It can provide suggestions and recommendations on project structure, code organization, version control, and other software development best practices. It can also help programmers in managing their tasks, deadlines, and milestones by providing reminders and scheduling assistance. This can help programmers in staying organized, meeting deadlines, and delivering high-quality projects.
5. **Collaboration and Brainstorming**: ChatGPT can facilitate collaboration among programmers by providing a platform for brainstorming and idea generation. It can help programmers in discussing and refining their ideas, providing feedback, and collaborating on code or documentation. ChatGPT can also help in fostering a creative and collaborative environment, enhancing team dynamics, and promoting innovation in programming projects.

Here is the list of products that which is based on chatgpt

* [**MyGPT** ](https://mygpt.thesamur.ai/)â This is one of the best products that I have used. Even after chatgpt is its highest capacity these products work a lot. MyGPT using ChatGPT API and provide same results as chatgpt provides. MyGPT is just a front-end UI of Chatgpt API, that help you get very responsive output even at the time of chatgpt is on its capacity. You can also see the short prompt.
* [**Memejourney** ](http://memejourney.thesamur.ai/)â ChatGPT for memes: Turn text into meme generation using ChatGPT, a midjourney for memes. Create memes by using memejournney.
* [**Heybot** ](https://heybot.thesamur.ai/)â Website to Chatbot powered by ChatGPT. Convert your website/blog into a chatbot in minutes without any coding.
* [**Ritebot**](https://ritebot.thesamur.ai/) **â** AI-powered Paraphraser, Grammar checker, Summariser, and Translator built on top of ChatGPT.

In conclusion, ChatGPT can be a valuable assistant for programmers, providing them with code generation, debugging assistance, learning and education, project planning and management, and collaboration and brainstorming support. Its ability to generate detailed and enthusiastic answers can inspire programmers and add a sense of enthusiasm in their programming tasks, making the overall experience more enjoyable and productive.

[**AutoGPT**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

AutoGPT's capabilities in combining GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via API and its ability to autonomously iterate on prompts and improve based on feedback open up a wide range of possibilities for its implementation in different use cases. From content generation to software development, recipe creation to task automation, and research assistance to summarization, AutoGPT can be a powerful tool for autonomously performing tasks, continuously improving its output, and showcasing true AGI capabilities."

What they mean by ""Non-API Content are ChatGPT DALL-E2. These are research models and whatever content users put into these models is being looked at by OpenAi to further improve these models.

are you worried about this? How do you solve this problem?

Also Gpt4 cost $20/person, if I have to give it to all employees it will cost me a lot. How are you guys solving this?

As I searched on the web and this subreddit, the only possible solution is to use commands to continue from the last response. In my experience, it rarely works. It generates the same code but independently. As a result, many variables have been changed, and the code does not work. I need to adjust the entire code, which sometimes takes more time than writing it from scratch.

ChartGPT 3.5 perfectly satisfies my need, and my only problem is incomplete codes. Can I resolve this issue by upgrading to Pro (4.0), or the number of tokens is the same?

Sorry for bringing up this common issue, but I am stuck with no solution."

Hey everyone! I'm excited to share my latest project with you: ChatGPT CLI. It's a command-line interface (CLI) built for interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT, designed to streamline and enhance your experience with the GPT model.

Here are some of the key features that make ChatGPT CLI a game-changer:

* **Interactive streaming mode**: Chat in real-time with the GPT model through the CLI, making your interactions fast and efficient.
* **Query mode**: Need a quick answer? Use the query mode for single input-output interactions with the GPT model.
* **Context management**: The CLI automatically maintains message history across calls, allowing for seamless conversations with the GPT model.

    Â± |main {1} â| â ./bin/chatgpt can you say something about the knicks?
    Yes, the New York Knicks are a professional basketball team based in New York City. They play in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and have won two NBA championships in their history, in 1970 and 1973. The team has a dedicated and passionate fan base and has undergone several changes over the years in terms of players, coaches, and front office personnel. They have been playing well in the current season under the head coach Tom Thibodeau and have made it to the playoffs.

    Â± |main {1} â| â ./bin/chatgpt what gave them that name?
    The New York Knicks team name comes from the Dutch word ""knickerbocker,"" which refers to the style of pants that the early Dutch settlers wore in New York. The term ""Knickerbocker"" became associated with New York City, and it was later used as the name for the team when they were founded in 1946. So, the team name ""New York Knicks"" is essentially a shortened version of ""New York Knickerbockers.""

    Â± |main {1} â| â ./bin/chatgpt what else do you know about the settlers?
    The early Dutch settlers in what is now New York were part of the Dutch West India Company and established a colony called New Netherland in the early 17th century. They founded several towns and settlements, including New Amsterdam, which later became New York City. The Dutch colony was established as a trading center and was a significant economic hub for the Atlantic world. The settlers had a significant impact on the development of New York City, with a lasting influence on the city's architecture, language, religion, and cultural traditions. Some of the prominent Dutch settlers include Peter Stuyvesant, who was the last Dutch governor of New Netherland, and Alexander Hamilton, who was born in the West Indies but was of Dutch descent.

* **Sliding window history**: The CLI trims conversation history while preserving context, keeping token limits in check and ensuring smooth interactions.
* **Custom context from local files**: Easily provide the GPT model with custom context using piping, so it can reference specific data during your conversation.

    Â± |main {1} â| â cat LICENSE | chatgpt what kind of license is this?
    This is the MIT License, which is a permissive free software license that allows users to modify and distribute the software under certain conditions, including the inclusion of the original copyright notice and permission notice. This license also disclaims liability and warranties, making it a risk-free option for developers and users.

Wanted to reach out here to see if there are any wizards that can help out.

&#x200B;

I am currently building a platform that uses the ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo API but am having an issue where the execution time is far longer than it is in normal GPT 3 prompt form. 

&#x200B;

All the platform does is take the inputs from the user and insert them into a prompt that is fed to the GPT API, but the execution time is taking 2 minutes+ compared to the usual sub 10-20 seconds. 

&#x200B;

Any known fixes for this?  There must be a solution as there are many platforms that use the API successfully with the ability to deliver high-quality and quick answers.
