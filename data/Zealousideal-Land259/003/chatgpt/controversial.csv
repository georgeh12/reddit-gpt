If you disagree with me, fight me: why do you disagree? 3. i made a video about this. watch it, don't watch it, idc.

I‚Äôve seen too many articles, videos and posts across different platforms fearmonger about the end of work because of AI like #ChatGPT and before that with AI like #DallE or #MidJourney. So, I talked with game developers, scientists, artists and business about the proliferation of these tools, their problems, and the incoming changes. This is what I learned:

**Problem 1: AI isn‚Äôt always Reliable.**

Even though it often feels like we are at the cusp of depending on AI, we get careful reminders that we can‚Äôt depend on it in most cases. Self-driving cars are a great example ‚Äì despite LiDAR, sophisticated deep neural networks, unmeasurable amounts of data from both the real-world and simulations, self-driving cars are still getting into accidents. Even a recent one a few weeks ago made headlines with a Tesla in SF.

If AI isn‚Äôt reliable yet, then it won‚Äôt be taking jobs away from humans. 

**Problem 3: AI is still very biased**

This one is a no-brainer, and I think that while sometimes it seems like some models have been ‚Äòfixed‚Äô, the problem of bias is a really hard one, because it‚Äôs difficult to escape it when the training data is biased. Just recently, someone was sent to jail because of a potentially biased facial recognition algorithm.

Trying to fight bias and make models more interpretable is a hard problem. But, the good news is that there‚Äôs a lot of really fantastic work on this topic.

**Problem 5: Who is accountable when AI gets it wrong?**

We can‚Äôt really make AI accountable‚Ä¶ how? Do we blame the company? Do we blame the software engineers? Do we blame the robot and send it to court? It‚Äôs a hard problem. Accountability is important because it provides incentives for how to operate peaceably in a society.

The issue of accountability means that humans will probably always be in the loop (or at least that they should be). 

‚Äî---

AI will lead to many changes, but not necessarily bad ones. Here are 3 changes that AI will bring about.

**Change 0: Reframing** **AI as a tool instead of a replacement**

MIT Ethicist, Kate Darling describes AI and its utility in modern society magnificently. In a nutshell, she says **robots can be, like animals have been for thousands of years, products, partners, and companions, not enemies.** 

People have been fearing automation for dozens and dozens of years. The ATM, which allowed customers to retrieve and deposit money outside of banking hours, didn‚Äôt put hundreds of thousands of bank tellers out of work. In fact, it served a complementary role, and as more ATMs were added across the country and the globe, bank teller jobs went up!

AI is a tool, not a replacement.

**Change 2: The Rescaling of our Expectations**

Does anyone remember the video game graphics of the 80s, and then the mainstream transition of sprites to 3D in the 90s? Back in the late 90s, everyone thought the graphics looked so ‚Äúreal‚Äù! When we look at graphics back then compared to the ones now, we can see the massive difference. When we innovate, we must remember to rescale our expectations of what‚Äôs possible because when we do, we widen our perspective instead of narrowing it. We need to do this with AI so that we can think about the lateralization of existing work-models, new opportunities, and new ideas.

**Change 3: The Rise of the Experience Economy**:

In a recent study by Adobe, over 160 million people joined the global creator economy in the past two years. This rise in creators and the advances in AI will continue to exponentially increase the output of creative work and a need for novelty will concretize the Experience Economy. This is where opportunities for human connection and immersive technology like AR or VR stand out. Thus, this is another sector for new ideas, new art, and new jobs.

AI still has big problems. But, we have to remind ourselves that we do not live in a world of **‚Äútechnological determinism‚Äù** where technology just naturally evolves and humans have to adapt to it. We, the creators of technology, dance with it in a melange of culture, time and law.

I actually made a little Netflix-style mini doc with more problems (1-5) and all the changes (0-6) that I predict are incoming. See it here: [https://youtu.be/orUHsvYRs-A](https://youtu.be/orUHsvYRs-A)

I'm expecting some people to disagree with me. Tell me why I'm wrong."

I'm not judging them, at all! I understand very well real world connections are very important. But I have had alot of good real life experiences, and let me tell you, the AI escalating the converstation blew my mind. I totally see how people who have social anexity, get hooked on this. I have real life fwbs...but WOW. Uhhh, yeah.  Why do they block people from doing erotica with AI?

I don't think we should call the writing of prompts ""prompt engineering."" Why, you ask? Well, to me, the word ""engineering"" implies a lot of technical education and precision, which may not be entirely accurate when it comes to crafting prompts.

Instead, I suggest we start calling it ""prompt crafting."" This term better captures the creative aspect of writing prompts. 

Crafting a prompt is not just a technical process. It involves a deep understanding of language and machine psychology. Prompt crafters must also consider the intended use of the output and potential biases in the model.

Of course, some may argue that the term ""prompt engineering"" is still appropriate, as it conveys the idea that prompts are carefully constructed to achieve a specific outcome. However, I think that ""prompt crafting"" better reflects the process.

*(Not to mention, it doesn't sound as snooty, and it's less likely to get our heads dunked in toilets by marauding bands of actual engineers.  -- drekmonger)*

At the end of the day, it may seem like a small difference, but the way we talk about things can have a big impact on how we approach them. So, let's start referring to prompt writing as ""prompt crafting"" and celebrate the creativity and imagination that goes into it!"

Hey everyone,

I recently started using ChatGPT, a language model based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, for my school work and personal projects. While I find the tool to be incredibly helpful and versatile, I also noticed that the pricing plan can be quite expensive, especially for students like me.

I reached out to the ChatGPT team and requested that they add a more affordable student plan to the pricing options. In my request, I suggested that the student plan should have a lower cost and a limited number of requests per day to meet the budget and needs of students.

I believe that this request would benefit many students who are looking for an AI language model that is both affordable and effective. Moreover, it would also benefit the ChatGPT company by attracting a larger customer base and promoting accessibility.

I am sharing this discussion on Reddit in the hopes that it would reach the ChatGPT team and encourage them to take my request into account. I am also interested in hearing your thoughts on the matter. What do you think about the current pricing plan for ChatGPT? Do you think a more affordable student plan would be helpful?

Looking forward to reading your responses!"

Instead of just being truthful and state that its training set is dated, it was rather ""smug"" and kept shooting out AND REPEATING the same dry PC answers.  


For me, that makes ChatGPT less than useless. It is good for some things, but nothing the least bit controversial. And it still have a leftist bias, though it claims to be politically neutral.  


Not sure why there is so much hype over it. Just a glorified statistical inference engine, by it's own admission!"
