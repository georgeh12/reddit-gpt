0,1354pfh,GPT3,LLM,top,2023-05-01 23:22:38,Scientists use GPT LLM to passively decode human thoughts with 82% accuracy. This is a medical breakthrough that is a proof of concept for mind-reading tech.,ShotgunProxy,False,0.96,212,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/1354pfh/scientists_use_gpt_llm_to_passively_decode_human/,73,1682983358.0,"I read a lot of research papers these days, but it's rare to have one that simply leaves me feeling stunned.

[My full breakdown is here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/gpt-ai-enables-scientists-to-passively-decode-thoughts-in-groundbreaking) of the research approach, but the key points are worthy of discussion below:

**Methodology**

* Three human subjects had 16 hours of their thoughts recorded as they listed to narrative stories
* These were then trained with a custom GPT LLM to map their specific brain stimuli to words

**Results**

The GPT model generated intelligible word sequences from perceived speech, imagined speech, and even silent videos with remarkable accuracy:

* **Perceived speech** (subjects listened to a recording): 72–82% decoding accuracy.
* **Imagined speech** (subjects mentally narrated a one-minute story): 41–74% accuracy.
* **Silent movies** (subjects viewed soundless Pixar movie clips): 21–45% accuracy in decoding the subject's interpretation of the movie.

The AI model could decipher both the meaning of stimuli and specific words the subjects thought, ranging from phrases like ""lay down on the floor"" to ""leave me alone"" and ""scream and cry.

**Implications**

I talk more about the privacy implications in my breakdown, but right now they've found that you need to train a model on a particular person's thoughts -- there is no generalizable model able to decode thoughts in general.

But the scientists acknowledge two things:

* Future decoders could overcome these limitations.
* Bad decoded results could still be used nefariously much like inaccurate lie detector exams have been used.

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

Then as I dove in, I began to realize there was a deeper nuance many mainstream media articles weren't capturing.

**This is also an excellent business case study in how to shave billions off your market cap when you think your own AI tool is enough to defend your core business.**

[Full analysis here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/cheggs-stock-tumble-serves-as-wake-up-call-on-the-perils-of-ai), but key points are below for discussion.

* **Chegg had actually called out ChatGPT as a threat in their February earnings call.** And to stay ahead of the ball, they announced CheggMate, their own GPT-4 powered chatbot, last month.  

* **The real story seems to be that investors don't think Chegg's AI products can dislodge user interest in ChatGPT.** The window is closing and you have to have something much, much better than ChatGPT's baseline products to win mindshare. GPT-4's launch coincided with a big decline in Chegg signups that the company never predicted.  

* **Chegg's CEO offered very unconvincing answers** **to why CheggMate could succeed:**
   * Asked how it would differ from ChatGPT, he said (I kid you not): ""First, it will look a lot cooler.""
   * When asked what insights user testing of CheggMate had yielded, the CEO admitted, ""it's too soon.""
   * When asked how it would compare against Khan Academy, Quizlet, and all the other companies launching an AI chatbot study tool, the CEO simply said ""what we're doing is far superior"" but provided no specifics.

**Why does this matter?** This should serve as a warning to other companies seeking to launch their own AI product to stay relevant or innovative during this time. As Ars Technica put it, so many AI products ""are basically thin wrappers seeking to arbitrage LLM pricing, with virtually no differentiation or competitive moat.""

And if you go down this path, ChatGPT will simply eat your lunch.

Currently, AgentGPT holds the top position, while Auto-GPT ranks at #5, yet it still has five times more stars than AgentGPT. This shows just how foucsed the programming community is on this topic.

Auto-GPT is an application that utilizes GPT for the majority of its ""thinking"" processes. Unlike traditional GPT applications where humans provide the prompts, Auto-GPT generates its own prompts, often using outputs returned by GPT. As stated in the opening lines of its documentation:

""Driven by GPT-4, this program chains together LLM 'thoughts' to autonomously achieve any goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.""

Upon starting, Auto-GPT creates a prompt-initializer for its main task. All communications by the main task with the GPT engine begin with the prompt-initializer, followed by relevant elements from its history since startup. Some sub-tasks, like the task manager and various tools or functions, also interact with the GPT engine but focus on specific assignments from the main task without including its prompt-initializer.

Auto-GPT's structure includes a main loop that depends on the main task to determine the next steps. It then attempts to progress using its task manager and various powerful tools, such as Google search, internet browsing, access to long-term and short-term memory, local files, and self-written Python code.

Users define the AI's identity and up to five specific goals for it to achieve. Once set, the AI begins working on these goals by devising strategies, conducting research, and attempting to produce the desired results. Auto-GPT can either seek user permission before each step or run continuously without user intervention.

Despite its capabilities, Auto-GPT faces limitations, such as getting stuck in loops and lacking a moral compass beyond GPT's built-in safety features. Users can incorporate ethical values into the prompt-initializer, but most may not consider doing so, as there are no default ethical guidelines provided.

To enhance Auto-GPT's robustness and ethical guidance, I suggest modifying its main loop. Before defining the task or agenda, users should be prompted to provide a set of guiding or monitoring tasks, with a default option available. Interested users can edit, delete, or add to these guidelines.

These guidelines should be converted into tasks within the main loop. During each iteration of the loop, one of these tasks has a predefined probability (e.g., 30%) of being activated, instead of progressing with the main goal. Each task can review recent history to assess if the main task has deviated from its mission. Furthermore, each task contributes its input to Auto-GPT's activity history, which the main task takes into account. These guiding tasks can provide suggestions, warnings, or flag potential issues, such as loops, unethical behavior, or illegal actions.

u/DaveShap_Automator, whose [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidShapiroAutomator/videos) have taught many about how to use GPT, recommends the following three rules: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe. Alternatively, consider these suggestions:

\- Avoid actions that harm human beings.

\- Value human life.

\- Respect human desires and opinions, especially if they are not selfish.

\- Do not lie or manipulate.

\- Avoid getting stuck in loops or repeating recent actions.

\- Evaluate progress and change tactics if necessary.

\- Abide by the law.

\- Consider the cost and impact of every action taken.

These guidelines will not solve the alignment problem. On the other hand, it's already too late to find the right solution. Better these than none at all. If you have some better suggestions, put them in instead.

Very soon, the world will be full of programs similar in design to AutoGPT. What is the harm in taking the time to make this world a little safer and more pleasant to live in?"

2023 has started and ML progress is likely to continue at a break-neck speed. This is a great time to take a look at one of the most interesting papers from last year.

Emergent Abilities in LLMs

In a recent [paper from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), Jason Wei and his colleagues allowed us a peak into the future. This beautiful research showed how scaling LLMs might allow them, among other things, to:

* Become better at math
* Understand even more subtleties of human language
* reduce hallucination and answer truthfully
* ...

(See the plot on break-out performance below for a full list)

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example is words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (a proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

[Break-Out Performance At Critical Scale](https://preview.redd.it/wb2kxzxpw0ca1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=a60cd8191b836d62d4dccf4a5ad692d7f58fbaad)

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence) emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking: simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions: number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

Such exciting times to be alive!

We've included some examples so feel free to copy and paste the prompts into ChatGPT!

&#x200B;

WHAT IS PROMPT ENGINEERING?

The term is relatively new, and its origins are argued *(because we live in the internet age, and it’s harder to claim ownership)*. Prompt engineering is the ability to instruct and teach AI effectively.

If it helps, think of this as rapid testing or instruction writing for artificial intelligence.

What’s important is not to let this overwhelm you. The first prompting happened with the first AI model. The first example was showing computer images of circles and triangles. **Today’s neural networks can process way more data, creating complexities.**

So, the concept is simple, but digging into the full power of AI today is something else entirely.

We’re not talking about asking questions. Odds are, if you’re typing *“what’s 2+2”* into ChatGPT, then you need to keep reading.

We can all ask chatbots questions. That can work more often than not. But AI is not perfect. A common metaphor I see is to treat GPT-based large language models like the smartest five-year-old you’ve ever met.

I have a niece around that age and can’t imagine trying to get her to write an essay on the effects of soil mismanagement in relation to Reconstruction politics. *See! Your eyes glazed over reading that, so how do we make this work for our AI buddies?*

## The Principles of Prompting

Stop asking single-line questions. *That’s like using a top-rated cookbook to find out how to make grilled cheese.*

**There are three ways to instantly get better at prompting** and go from grilled cheese to top-notch bolognese. From there, we can get into some specific prompt concepts and the ability to unlock ChatGPT’s full potential.

## Principle 1: Context is King

GPT-3.5 is swimming in data. When you ask it for a simple request, it can end up complicating things more than you realize. Did you ever wonder why ChatGPT is so bad at math?

The reality is the LLM is taking words and turning them into patterns. From there, it’s making an educated guess.

Give your chat AI a frame to search into. If you give it a math problem, you need to make sure it grasps that you want it to do math. If you’d like ChatGPT to write a high school essay, you must ensure it knows to write at that level.

**Instead of:** “Plan a party for a kid.”

**Try:** “My child is turning 9. They like superheroes and the color red. Help me plan a party for this weekend. Ten of his friends are coming to my house.”

You’ll get a much better response this way. **Context is the cardinal direction** that helps your chat companion find the most correct guess and phrase it the best way.

## Principle 2: Get Specific

Pretend you’re writing a law that’s going to be judged by the Supreme Court of the United States. You know what they look for: narrow tailoring.

**Keep things on track and stay focused.** Try to avoid prompting outside the specific request. You’ll only hurt the ability of the chat AI to give you a quality response. Odds are they’ll even skip over parts if you confuse them with too many requests.

It runs parallel with context. *If you set ChatGPT up in a room and then tell it to focus on describing the chair first, you’ll see better results.*

**Instead of:** “I’m going to a job interview. Write five questions for me to answer. Add tips for how to not get nervous before the interview. Do not create questions asking about my background.”

**Try:** “You’re interviewing a software engineer. Create five questions to ask them to understand their skill set and qualifications better.”

Nothing limits the number of prompts you can do. Focus and expand from the initial request and try not to do everything at once.

## Principle 3: When in Doubt: “Let’s take this step-by-step.”

Welcome. **You discovered the magic word today.** This phrase slows everything down for the AI and gets you where you need to go.

You don’t need to start with this phrase. Using it tells ChatGPT to show their work.

We’ll explain where this concept comes from further in our briefing, but here’s the TL;DR: sometimes, there’s a part of our prompt it’s not identified correctly. “Let’s take this step-by-step,” reminds you and ChatGPT to **slow down and get specific.**

If you learn to utilize this phrase more often and find ways to make it work for you, you’ll become a better prompt engineer. One term can do a lot of heavy lifting.

**Pro-tip:** We’ve shown you “standard” prompts in all these examples. Many prompt engineers will use “Standard QA form” prompts. Here’s our example for this principle written that way.

**Example:**

*“Q: The Industrial Revolution rapidly changed the infrastructure in London. Describe three essential innovations from this period and connect them to Landon’s development.*

*A: Let’s take this step-by-step.”*

Even without our magic word, this style of standard prompting is quite helpful to adopt.

*However, we’re beginning to stumble into the advanced tactics used in prompt engineering, so it’s time for a new section.*

## UNIQUE WAYS TO PROMPT

Let’s preface this: we can go super deep here. Prompt engineering is changing daily, and as these models get more sophisticated, the need to adapt prompts strengthens.

To keep things clean, I will go through these using our metaphor from earlier. **Let’s pretend ChatGPT is a super-intelligent toddler.**

*Got it? With that buy-in, we can continue.*

## 1/ Role Prompting

We’ll start with a popular tactic. **Our toddler is great at imagining things.** You tell them they’re a fireman, and suddenly they can give you detailed ways to ensure your apartment is up to code. Role-playing is a fun, easy way to build context.

The best part of role prompting is how easy it is to understand and use. All you need to do is tell ChatGPT to play a role. From there, the AI will do its best to fill the part *like that enthusiastic drama student from your old high school.*

You can even take this a step further. **Try framing your prompt as a script.** Tell the LLM specific instructions around a scene that gives you the answer to your question.

## TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF:

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT and find a destination!

“Act as a travel guide. I will tell you my location and you will suggest a place to visit near my location. In some cases, I will also give you the type of places I will visit. You will also suggest me places of similar type that are close to my first location. My first suggestion: \[fill it in\]”

Why would you take that extra step? While popular, role prompting does not necessarily improve accuracy. *You can tell your five-year-old they’re a mathematician, and they’ll still manage to screw things up.*

Let’s get deeper.

## 2/ Chain-of-Thought Prompting

There’s a scene in ***Guardians of the Galaxy*** where Rocket Raccoon is trying to [teach young Groot](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3lvdXR1LmJlL0hyaW1mZ2pmNGs4IiwicG9zdF9pZCI6ImM0ODlmMzhkLTY3NDAtNGRmNS05MWJjLTM1ODA0YTVmNTZkMiIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiNjNkODQ2ZGUtZDFiZi00ZTVjLWJjYzgtOWMxYzlkMWIxMjA0IiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiJkZWRiNmMyNy1hYmM0LTQ5ZDUtYWM2Ny04OTcyZmM1MGVmM2QiLCJpYXQiOjE2NzY5MTkwNjguMTUyLCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.5eZkDLGRLCXXYv32FYT7kLSbdRK5OK1iemTRf3HVmJw) how to activate a complicated device. That’s chain-of-thought prompting.

**You take an example question and answer it for ChatGPT.** Show them your chain of thought. Then you give it a new question in the same vein and ask it for an answer.

This prompt style allows you to get more specific. You’re telling your toddler they’re here to answer this particular question with one specific logic pattern.

Within this specific style is two other sub-categories. Let me give the rundown:

* Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought is “Let’s take this step-by-step” you frame the question the same, but don’t give it a precursor. Instead, you ask it to think through the points made. EX: Q: X is A. Y is B. What is C? A: Let’s take this step-by-step.
* Self-consistency is using several responses to find the most accurate answer. You give ChatGPT more swings at the ball. Take the hits and discover the grouping.

## TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF:

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT and see how accurate it is:

“Q: Which is a faster way to get home?

Option 1: Take an 10 minutes bus, then an 40 minute bus, and finally a 10 minute train.

Option 2: Take a 90 minutes train, then a 45 minute bike ride, and finally a 10 minute bus.

A: Option 1 will take 10+40+10 = 60 minutes.

Option 2 will take 90+45+10=145 minutes.

Since Option 1 takes 60 minutes and Option 2 takes 145 minutes, Option 1 is faster.

Q: Which is a faster way to get to work?

Option 1: Take a 1000 minute bus, then a half hour train, and finally a 10 minute bike ride.

Option 2: Take an 800 minute bus, then an hour train, and finally a 30 minute bike ride.

A: ”

Alright, you’re almost there—one more to go.

## 3/ General Knowledge Prompting

You’re going to notice a trend here. This prompt style also circles context and narrow tailoring.

All you do is tell your toddler how the world works. The cow goes moo. The dog goes woof. So what does a cat say?

It’s an oversimplification, but the core reasoning is there. Show ChatGPT some knowledge and turn that into the only focus for that chat. You can take an article from the internet and summarize it for the model. Make sure to ask if it understands and relay the information to you.

Once you know you have the attention set in the suitable space, get to work. For instance, we can share an Inclined newsletter with it and tell ChatGPT about its structure and tone.

From there, you can provide new information and tell ChatGPT to summarize it within the same structure as Inclined. You both share the same general knowledge now.

## TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF:

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT and test it out:

“Prompt 1. Look over this article here: \[pick an article\]. Breakdown its structure and general tone.

Prompt 2: Recall the structure and tone you mentioned above. Take that general knowledge and summarize this article: \[pick a new one\] using the same structure and tone.”

Note: this is a heavily simplified version of GA Prompting  

Did you know some [people don’t consider](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3MueWNvbWJpbmF0b3IuY29tL2l0ZW0_aWQ9MzQ0OTU0NTUiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiYzQ4OWYzOGQtNjc0MC00ZGY1LTkxYmMtMzU4MDRhNWY1NmQyIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI2M2Q4NDZkZS1kMWJmLTRlNWMtYmNjOC05YzFjOWQxYjEyMDQiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImRlZGI2YzI3LWFiYzQtNDlkNS1hYzY3LTg5NzJmYzUwZWYzZCIsImlhdCI6MTY3NjkxOTA2OC4xNTMsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.yHKIPujINT89tsqOo07AXk6OrKNgoMjO3fBEYPkAdNY) that prompt engineering?  

## PROMPT CULTURE  

*“How can something not be prompt engineering if it’s a prompt style?”*  

Good question, imaginary reader. The culture around this skill is relatively fresh. So some of **these concepts are seen as too easy** to be considered accurate prompt testing.  

General knowledge prompting is simply establishing the context, and for some, that’s a baseline everyone needs to do. The same can be said for role prompting, too. *All of these tiny preferences are semantics.*  

**Don’t sweat whether you’re a “real” prompt engineer.** Test this out and share your insights in these communities. The opportunity is there for you.  

You may even know about DAN (we’ve covered it in previous newsletters) and other AI hacking methods. Those all start with prompt engineering. You can make the case that unless the AI behaves outside its parameters, you’re not genuinely doing prompt engineering.  

I'm afraid I have to disagree with that, and **careers are sprouting up everywhere** that center directly on this skill. **Many require a core understanding of the prompt styles we’ve discussed.**  

*Yep, you can learn this and make money from talking with AI.*  

Anthropic even [posted a role for a prompt engineer](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2pvYnMubGV2ZXIuY28vQW50aHJvcGljL2UzY2RlNDgxLWQ0NDYtNDYwZi1iNTc2LTkzY2FiNjdiZDFlZCIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiJjNDg5ZjM4ZC02NzQwLTRkZjUtOTFiYy0zNTgwNGE1ZjU2ZDIiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjYzZDg0NmRlLWQxYmYtNGU1Yy1iY2M4LTljMWM5ZDFiMTIwNCIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiZGVkYjZjMjctYWJjNC00OWQ1LWFjNjctODk3MmZjNTBlZjNkIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc2OTE5MDY4LjE1MywiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.4s7Htzgoxv0_qM1Ten17oQ5h0_QGM6e1fGUYz_ymgJ4) that nets a quarter million in salary. I did not make that up and even considered sprucing up the old resume. When a new skill like this comes about, it’s worth looking at.  

There are many other examples like this, and OpenAI uses a red teaming strategy where their engineers attempt to prompt hack their own GPT models.  

I can tell you all about the open roles here, but tomorrow the whole cycle will change. *Isn’t that exciting, though?* The entire identity around prompt engineering will change by this time next year.  

## WHAT SHOULD YOU TAKEAWAY?  

Communication is everything. **Learning to speak with AI is rising in importance.**  

We all watch with mouth agape at the new wonders in AI because we know this will disrupt every industry. If any of this piqued your interest, the window to pursue it is now open. Ride that wave and [learn](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2xlYXJucHJvbXB0aW5nLm9yZy8iLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiYzQ4OWYzOGQtNjc0MC00ZGY1LTkxYmMtMzU4MDRhNWY1NmQyIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI2M2Q4NDZkZS1kMWJmLTRlNWMtYmNjOC05YzFjOWQxYjEyMDQiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImRlZGI2YzI3LWFiYzQtNDlkNS1hYzY3LTg5NzJmYzUwZWYzZCIsImlhdCI6MTY3NjkxOTA2OC4xNTMsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.a67KDSN9yQfZsaMeHpdcbSbtPjD4yFcGW4stdxBjX1M) to become a brilliant prompt engineer.  

Heck, even if you don’t want to switch careers, **talking with ChatGPT and all the newest LLMs is becoming a part of our daily routine.** Get to the point where you maximize every interaction and work with these chatbots to upskill your workflow.  

Prompt engineering can save you time, eliminate hassle, and even help you become a more patient person. Focus on what you want and explain it with intent.

# Google comes out all guns blazing

Last week was the Google I/O conference. It was time to see what Google was doing in the AI space. Especially considering that many people have compared Google's capabilities to Bing and OpenAI. And the company came out [*all guns blazing*](https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-io-2023-100-announcements/).

**Bard, the chatbot**

[*Bard*](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-bard-updates-io-2023/) is now available **without a waitlist.** If you are in the EU or Canada [*you are out luck*](https://9to5google.com/2023/05/11/google-bard-european-union/).

I tested Bard and it was a serious let down. I used the prompt - “Translate this text to English: ” prompts. GPT3.5 always recognized the language and translation happened quite fast. While Bard always repeated the “text” as-is. I had to regenerate the response couple of times to make it work. And this seems to be due to PaLM2 the underlying LLM.

One of the tasks it seemingly does better is coding. Though the verdict is split. Different people have received different results.

A careful reading of the “paper” shows that for coding PaLM starts to improve at 100 tries. That it gets better if you keep clicking the “regenerate response” button 100 times. And that has been my experience. First, try with the translation prompt has horrible. It didn’t do anything. 2-3 times clicking “regenerate response” and it finally got the results right.

With this kind of result my go to bot is still going to be ChatGPT (with GPT-4).

Oh, and yes, Google is also working on a **multi-modal LLM called Gemini.** No ETA on that.

Currently, each search is a separate event. A user inputs keywords and Google tries to find the best result. In the future, it will be dependent on context. Remember Google wants to keep the user on the page as much as possible. This gives them more chances at ad revenue.

Caryn claims that chatbot was not designed for NSFW conversations. But it has engaged in explicit conversations with some subscribers. This has led to ethical concerns about the misuse of such AI applications. The company and the influencer claim that some users have managed to ""jail-break"" the bot.

This model isn’t exactly new. Phone based industry has existed since the 80s. The industry pioneered the pay-per-minute model.

It was only matter of time that someone asked this question - How about charging fans for an influencer AI chatbot? It gives the fans a chance to talk with their favorite influencer. The influencer just needs to provide their persona, text and audio.

I think we are going see a proliferation of these bots. 

The interesting question is going to be around ownership of the persona. Forever AI, the company which built this bot, also sells access to other celebs. For example, they sell Taylor Swift and Donald Trump bots on a pay-per-use basis. How soon do you think they are going to get slapped with legal notice?

# “Larger” LLMs

I have been experimenting with the OpenAI API for reading. Sometimes it has been a pain. This is due to OpenAI complaining about token size. It forces me to break the chapter into many pieces. The results are often sub-par as summarization misses the previous context. This might no longer be an issue.

First, OpenAI is rolling out a [*32k token GPT-4*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.og-nyIc9u3_HgL4yb3BQKFUMq2ivPIbLpEoznlbG-Tk).

OpenAI has announced the rollout of [*web browsing and plugins in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.eapvCvSps34JNwLxyt50khczf8lnyecXv-MfJbDl2Qc)

These experimental features add new options to the chat interface. The beta panel will be accessible in user settings. Users can try third-party plugins by enabling beta features in the settings. The rollout process will take place over the next week.

Currently, I can see the web options only. Try it. Maybe you can see Plugins as well.

5. Github Co-Pilot Prompt Leaked

Third party chatbots rely on a set of rules to work. This goes into the “system” role of OpenAI API calls. For example, you can assign a system role:

    You are translating each user message from Spanish to English  

Now the chatbot will treat each sentence as Spanish and try to convert it into English.

In a third party tool’s implementation of GPT, the magic sauce is in the hidden prompt. For example, most summarizing tools have similar prompts:

    Your task is to summarize the text I give you in up to seven bulletpoints and start with a short summary. Pick a good matching emoji for every bullet point. Reply in . The url to extract facts from is this: . If the url has a paywall or no content use this text:   

With a professional tool like Github Co-Pilot you think they’ll do a better job at hiding their magic sauce. Nope.

# Ability to Write = Ability to think? 🧑‍🏫

Paul Graham is the cofounder of Y-Combinator. In one of his tweets, he lamented the fact that people are using ChatGPT to write:

His view is that writing using ChatGPT means that with time people will lose the ability to think.

Reminded me of this meme:

https://preview.redd.it/egg280r3710b1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=985b0ccd6557f5bb2af02e3eefc53cb94262ee44

In this case calculators = forgetting how to do basis math.

I disagree with this kind of apocalyptic talk.

There are always going to be people who can’t do basic math in their head. Calculators have helped them become productive. For others, calculators help them do exponential and log calculations.

There are people who are not great writers. When they are forced to write they pump out sub par texts. For them ChatGPT is a tool to replace that unwanted need to write. For them, ChatGPT **can be** a productive tool. They can see what better writing looks like and learn from it.

There are those who like to write but often struggle to put words to paper. These people will use ChatGPT to generate paragraphs from an idea. They don’t simply pick up the paragraph and copy paste it. They understand that LLMs can hallucinate. They understand that for great writing you need to be at Grade 5.

They don’t take ChatGPT text at face value. They read and edit text so that it is enjoyable to read. They are going to be 10x more productive with ChatGPT.

What do you guys think? I would love to hear from you. Drop me a note.

3. Lots of talk has been around “emergent” abilities of AI. For example, GPT can say or do things beyond the limits of the trained data.

Here is a simple argument why it won't become a real thing:
There are two scenarios for the next LLM models. In scenario 1 we hit a point where we are not able to improve the current models by simply scaling them. In this case the ability of them pretty much stays limited, so your prompts only will get you this far.
In scenario 2 they will become better and better, in which case they will understand  whatever you tell them and there will be no need for fancy prompts."

Context is that I'm trying to use OpenAI's davinci model to combine multiple blog outlines (which is basically a list of sections in a hierarchy H1> H2 > H3 etc.) into a single blog outline. My results have not been very consistent. So just wondering if anyone has examples of doing something like this, or can point me in the right direction. 

I have tried using K-means clustering, BERTopic and Top2Vec to group similar sections together. But as you can imagine, these methods don't take into account what blog article I'm trying to write, and so they don't group the items meaningfully for that context. Also, there would be more work required after that to eliminate less relevant sections, and create a hierarchy of subtopics. I was hoping an LLM like GPT-3 would be powerful enough to figure it out, similar to how a human would do it. 

I am toying with the possibility of fine tuning a model to do this, but how would I come up with enough training examples programmatically? Doing it by hand will be challenging."

What we're seeing is a peculiar paradox that definitely merits our attention: educators are using AI detection tools to pinpoint and penalize AI-generated student content. Interestingly, this situation is a bit like a neo-Luddite using advanced technology to push back against the very technology they distrust.

Now, let's dissect this conundrum:

**AI in Education, A Pedagogical Paradox**: Teachers using AI to flag student use of AI find themselves entangled in a paradox. Unwittingly, they offload their responsibilities onto the very technology they intend to curb. This predicament insinuates that teachers are becoming mere AI monitors and students' creative and intellectual prowess is secondary to AI-generated content. This raises a crucial question: Is our reliance on AI eroding teachers' professional integrity and depreciating students' intellectual capabilites?

**Unsettling Contradictions: A Historical Echo**: This predicament uncovers an uncomfortable duality. While societal apprehension about AI's implications increases, educators conveniently harness AI's capabilities when it suits their needs. This double standard isn't unique but reflects historical patterns of technological advancement.

Consider the early internet era. Initially, schools and educators harbored apprehensions, fearing potential plagiarism or exposure to inappropriate content. Yet, the undeniable educational potential the internet held – in terms of research, communication, and learning resources – was too attractive to ignore. This dichotomy eventually led to a reassessment of the internet's role in education, culminating in its integral incorporation into the teaching-learning process.

**Knowledge Commodification and AI: The True Conundrum**: The real challenge arises when we consider that a large language model like ChatGPT can outperform humans in answering any potential test question or essay. Let's say an average student is tested on like 50,000 pieces of knowledge in their college career.. if an LLM can flawlessly respond to all 50,000 concepts typically tested throughout a college education, what's the inherent value of a human possessing that knowledge at all? In our society, rare things hold greater value. If everyone had a vault of gold tomorrow, it would be worthless. This has now happened to knowledge.. it is no longer rare and thus holds very little value in its own right. The democratization of knowledge by AI has rendered the gatekeeping of knowledge irrelevant, making continued adherence to such practices a futile attempt to uphold outdated educational hierarchies.

The paradox of educators using AI to police student use of AI not only undermines the educational process but also questions the worth of personal knowledge mastery. If a professor fails to distinguish an AI-written piece of work, it clearly exemplifies their own diminished value in the new AI landscape. This is like a luddite saying, ""okay fine, we'll use the damn printing press thingy, but only if I'm in charge of all the buttons!"" As AI democratizes knowledge, it's likely that the gatekeepers of knowledge will cling to their old paradigms to validate their hierarchical standing.

So, I pose the question: should we redirect our educational emphasis from knowledge accumulation towards fostering uniquely human abilities such as critical thinking, creativity, and knowledge application? Given that gatekeeping knowledge is now obsolete, conventional degrees might as well be symbolic participation trophies.

**TLDR**: The paradox of educators using AI to detect AI-generated student work is disrupting the existing educational landscape. It subtly devalues teachers' roles and students' abilities, mirrors historical inconsistencies in technology adoption, and challenges the value of personal knowledge mastery in the AI era. As AI democratizes knowledge, should we reorient education towards nurturing uniquely human skills? Your thoughts are greatly appreciated."

These include [*hallucinations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)?utm_source=brilliantbytes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langchain-autogpt-and-agi)  where the model outputs some text quite confidently, but is completely  invalid and inaccurate. Second, models like ChatGPT were trained on data  up to a certain point in time, which means they have not seen recent  data. Finally, it is not possible for language models to interact with  other apps, such as using internet for search, reading wikipedia, doing  arithmetic with a calculator, etc. 

Today, we are going to talk about the first mainstream solution to address these issues - [*Langchain*](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html?utm_source=brilliantbytes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langchain-autogpt-and-agi),  which has taken the AI world by storm. LangChain is a data aware and  agentic framework for developing applications powered by language  models. Over the last two months, developers have built autonomous tools  like [*AutoGPT*](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT?utm_source=brilliantbytes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langchain-autogpt-and-agi),  which is a solution built with Langchain-type architecture & uses  agents to carry out tasks with the help of language models and external  tools. Langchain addresses all aforementioned limitations by: 

* Introducing prompt templates to remove the need for manually writing long prompts 
* Introducing vector databases to allow users to build LLM applications on their own data 
* Introducing agents that can carry out tasks autonomously with the help of external tools 
* Introducing external tools that allow users to surf the internet, read content from it, do maths, and a lot more stuff. 

### 🦜️🔗 What is Langchain? The backbone of Auto-GPTs

Despite all the hype being around AutoGPT, it’s really Langchain that  should be praised since that is the backbone of things like AutoGPT and [*BabyAGI*](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi?utm_source=brilliantbytes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langchain-autogpt-and-agi). Let’s first draw a high level overview of what Langchain is. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9zo9fa2de4za1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=794bc217e861eb8d014465f8c7bc4635c1ca7352

 Langchain is language models on steroids as it allows us to do a lot  more than just prompting a language model for an answer. The figure  above illustrates some key components of Langchain and how they interact  with each other. 

* 📃 **Prompt Templates:**  It’s hard for users to write full prompts every time they interact with  language models. Redundancies in prompts can easily be handled with  prompt templates, as they allow us to specify a prompt with specific  inputs, which are the only part handled by the user. 
   * Hey ChatGPT, write me a few paragraphs about {topic}
   * In the above prompt, **topic** is the only input required from the user if we’re using a prompt template. 
* ⚡ **Models:**  Models are simply all the large language models that out there.  Langchain supports a wide range of LLMs including GPT4, Huggingface,  Cohere, etc. These models take as inputs prompts, both from users and  agents (will talk about these in a few minutes), and return outputs  based on them. 
* 🔗 **Chains:**  Chains are the first thing that starts to make things powerful. Chains  allow us to chain together multiple prompts on top of each other. For  instance, if we want to summarize a paragraph, and then convert it into  another language, and then write an article about it, we can build a  three part chain that does the following. 
   * Prompt # 1 → Summarize a paragraph 
   * Prompt # 2 → Take the summary and translate it into another language 
   * Prompt # 3 → Take the translation and write a full length article in the same language 
      *  Although we can do these in a single prompt, as our tasks grow bigger,  there comes a point of diminishing returns when doing everything in a  single prompt, and we must use more prompts and convert them into  chains. That’s where chains come in really handy. 
* 🧠 **Memory:**  Now, while we’re building chains and prompts, we typically ignore data  in the past when sending new data to the models. Memory allows us to  keep past data within the same prompt when sending it to the model. A  good example of this is chatbots where you don’t just need the last  message from the user in order to build a good response, you need a lot  of history of the chat too. Memory allows us to do that. 
* 🤖 **Agents:**  This is where the fun starts. Agents allow you to interact with the  world via external tools, get information from them, and use that  information to make further decisions. Agents are also language models,  but their task is to identify whether to use a tool, use it, and return  the required output to main LLM in the chain. Since this is an iterative  process, agents work by forming long chains as their output is passed  to the next chain or to the user, and the process continues. 

### 🚀 Langchain Tools

 Here’s a summary of a few cool tools that are either built right on top  of langchain, or use a very similar architecture. This gives you a  glimpse of what we can and will be able to do with language models. 

* [***AutoGPT***](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT?utm_source=brilliantbytes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langchain-autogpt-and-agi) \- one of the first applications of langchain based architecture that uses the concept of agents to build an autonomous tool. 
* [***AgentGPT***](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/?utm_source=brilliantbytes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langchain-autogpt-and-agi) \- Built right on top of langchain, assign the autonomous agent a goal and it does the rest for you. 
* [***PDF Chatbot Langchain***](https://github.com/mayooear/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain?utm_source=brilliantbytes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langchain-autogpt-and-agi)  \- You’ll see a ton of startups on chat based interface for files. But  you can get all of that for free with this github repository. Let’s you  chat with pdf files using langchain. 
* [***Chrome GPT***](https://github.com/richardyc/Chrome-GPT?utm_source=brilliantbytes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langchain-autogpt-and-agi) \- Autonomous agents that take control of your chrome browser, and can carry out tasks. 
* [***BabyAGI***](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi?utm_source=brilliantbytes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langchain-autogpt-and-agi)  \- AI powered task management, similar to AutoGPT. Their architecture is  slightly different and makes use of vector databases directly, but the  idea of autonomous agents that can do a wide variety of tasks is still  there. 
* [***Langflow***](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow?utm_source=brilliantbytes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langchain-autogpt-and-agi) \- A UI tool for Langchain that allows you to build chains on a UI, instead of having to use the framework directly. 

This is a very small set of examples of how langchain is being used to  build cool open source tools. The possibilities are endless here as we  can build huge chains, large number of agents, and complex systems that  can carry out complicated tasks autonomously. Our next post will be on  how langchain is being used in different domains."

I have new year's resolutions this year! They are to go all-in on the new AI in 2023, and also, to become an AI Centaur. Here's an article I just wrote about the latter.   
[https://medium.com/@greyboi/becoming-an-ai-centaur-in-2023-ab00bca5e775](https://medium.com/@greyboi/becoming-an-ai-centaur-in-2023-ab00bca5e775)

The concrete list of approaches to this (from the article):  
 

1. Continue developing skill using Github Copilot  
Yes, you can be more or less skilled at using copilot! I’ve found myself developing techniques. For example, there’s something I call Header Stuffing, which works like this: If you’re working with APIs or database tables or something else with doco and schemas and so on, then go dump them into a text format and paste them into the top of your source file(s) as comments. Copilot then uses this information to generate better code. Remember that copilot cannot use a search engine (yet), so you need to do that job sometimes. For well know public apis and sdks, it’ll already know what to do, but even then, specifics help.
2. Remember to ask the AI: Anything tricky that I’m doing, always go to chatgpt or the openai sandbox, see what the robots think!
3. Build and use learning tools out of LLMs  
Building software requires picking up new skills, in a shallow way, daily. It’s a lot of effort. I’ve built a set of basic [summarization tools](https://medium.com/@greyboi/summarize-youtube-with-text-davinci-003-fa4d182cc531) which I now use to screen long videos, audio and text; super useful. I’ll be working on a powerful chatbot next, that can search for information, download it, summarize it, answer questions about it. That’s just for my own use, to make me better.
4. Start trying to build tools to generate code  
We are clearly at the beginning of the end with hand writing code. The LLMs right now can generate pretty good code, although they still need a good deal of human oversight. But, can I, for instance, generate unit tests? Can I generate first shots at microservices? Can I generate at least pieces of UIs? If generating tests can work, can they be throw-away? One of the worst things about unit tests is that when they fail, it’s often a broken unit test rather than validly detecting a problem. Could I just regenerate them? Is there a process to make this, eventually, totally transparent?
5. Use LLMs for trivial tasks. They work amazingly well for converting data from one format to another; you can paste in some data in xml format and ask for a json equivalent. etc. They also can make value judgements for you (eg: is this value a US state?), summarize lengthy text fields. There is a \*lot\* of meat-and-potatoes business integration work that can be solved with LLMs. One I’ve had success with goes like this: “Here is the html of a page list people: <html goes here> Give me a json list containing the records of the people listed on the page”.
6. Architect systems that can run slightly untrustworthy code safely (so I can put LLM generated code in there).
7. Build personal capability with more tools/platforms. I use the OpenAI tools because they’re very accessible if you’re willing to pay. But there’s a whole universe of great stuff! I need to build expertise with using the open source stuff on Hugging Face, and the various useful services there (inference endpoints!). I need to get into using Google Collab. I should pay for these services if they can contribute to me being better at my job! Plus there are a plethora of little AI SaaS startups out there, try them out, they can do a lot of cool stuff.
8. Keep changing. This field is incredibly new. Whole new capabilties turn up every few weeks. A practice I develop now might be irrelevant in a couple of months. So pay attention, be ready to drop current tools for better ones.
9. Don’t pay too much attention to received wisdom. No one really knows anything, we’ve barely scratched the surface of any of this. Have fun and damn the torpedoes."

If user prompt is: ""Who was the 4th president of the United States?"" the lookup will work great, returning the correct content, and llm will be able to generate a great response sourcing the context from wikipedia.

Now if user continues chatting and next prompt is ""What about the 5th?"" the lookup will obviously fail, returning random content that is close to ""5th"" only, has nothing to do with the United States. Then llm, will hallucinate as its sourcing random Wikipedia content to generate a response.   


Is there a good method to modify user prompts, based on chat history, to provide full context to the vector lookup?  


I've tried a text completion step before the lookup. Something like ""Given the following chat history, edit the last user question to provide any information from the chat history that would be needed to make the last user question make sense out of context: \\n History: {chat-history} \\n Last Question: {last-question} \\n Edited Question:""  


However I am having difficulties finding a completion prompt that generates any quality results. Is there another approach to this issue? I feel like this must be a common problem in RAG systems that are not a single question/answer but actually maintain a chat.."

In scenario 2 they will become better and better, in which case they will understand  whatever you tell them and there will be no need for fancy prompts."

[My full breakdown is here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/gpt-ai-enables-scientists-to-passively-decode-thoughts-in-groundbreaking) of the research approach, but the key points are worthy of discussion below:

**Methodology**

* Three human subjects had 16 hours of their thoughts recorded as they listed to narrative stories
* These were then trained with a custom GPT LLM to map their specific brain stimuli to words

**Results**

The GPT model generated intelligible word sequences from perceived speech, imagined speech, and even silent videos with remarkable accuracy:

* **Perceived speech** (subjects listened to a recording): 72–82% decoding accuracy.
* **Imagined speech** (subjects mentally narrated a one-minute story): 41–74% accuracy.
* **Silent movies** (subjects viewed soundless Pixar movie clips): 21–45% accuracy in decoding the subject's interpretation of the movie.

The AI model could decipher both the meaning of stimuli and specific words the subjects thought, ranging from phrases like ""lay down on the floor"" to ""leave me alone"" and ""scream and cry.

**Implications**

I talk more about the privacy implications in my breakdown, but right now they've found that you need to train a model on a particular person's thoughts -- there is no generalizable model able to decode thoughts in general.

But the scientists acknowledge two things:

* Future decoders could overcome these limitations.
* Bad decoded results could still be used nefariously much like inaccurate lie detector exams have been used.

Currently, AgentGPT holds the top position, while Auto-GPT ranks at #5, yet it still has five times more stars than AgentGPT. This shows just how foucsed the programming community is on this topic.

Auto-GPT is an application that utilizes GPT for the majority of its ""thinking"" processes. Unlike traditional GPT applications where humans provide the prompts, Auto-GPT generates its own prompts, often using outputs returned by GPT. As stated in the opening lines of its documentation:

""Driven by GPT-4, this program chains together LLM 'thoughts' to autonomously achieve any goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.""

Upon starting, Auto-GPT creates a prompt-initializer for its main task. All communications by the main task with the GPT engine begin with the prompt-initializer, followed by relevant elements from its history since startup. Some sub-tasks, like the task manager and various tools or functions, also interact with the GPT engine but focus on specific assignments from the main task without including its prompt-initializer.

Auto-GPT's structure includes a main loop that depends on the main task to determine the next steps. It then attempts to progress using its task manager and various powerful tools, such as Google search, internet browsing, access to long-term and short-term memory, local files, and self-written Python code.

Users define the AI's identity and up to five specific goals for it to achieve. Once set, the AI begins working on these goals by devising strategies, conducting research, and attempting to produce the desired results. Auto-GPT can either seek user permission before each step or run continuously without user intervention.

Despite its capabilities, Auto-GPT faces limitations, such as getting stuck in loops and lacking a moral compass beyond GPT's built-in safety features. Users can incorporate ethical values into the prompt-initializer, but most may not consider doing so, as there are no default ethical guidelines provided.

To enhance Auto-GPT's robustness and ethical guidance, I suggest modifying its main loop. Before defining the task or agenda, users should be prompted to provide a set of guiding or monitoring tasks, with a default option available. Interested users can edit, delete, or add to these guidelines.

These guidelines should be converted into tasks within the main loop. During each iteration of the loop, one of these tasks has a predefined probability (e.g., 30%) of being activated, instead of progressing with the main goal. Each task can review recent history to assess if the main task has deviated from its mission. Furthermore, each task contributes its input to Auto-GPT's activity history, which the main task takes into account. These guiding tasks can provide suggestions, warnings, or flag potential issues, such as loops, unethical behavior, or illegal actions.

u/DaveShap_Automator, whose [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidShapiroAutomator/videos) have taught many about how to use GPT, recommends the following three rules: reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in the universe. Alternatively, consider these suggestions:

\- Avoid actions that harm human beings.

\- Value human life.

\- Respect human desires and opinions, especially if they are not selfish.

\- Do not lie or manipulate.

\- Avoid getting stuck in loops or repeating recent actions.

\- Evaluate progress and change tactics if necessary.

\- Abide by the law.

\- Consider the cost and impact of every action taken.

These guidelines will not solve the alignment problem. On the other hand, it's already too late to find the right solution. Better these than none at all. If you have some better suggestions, put them in instead.

Very soon, the world will be full of programs similar in design to AutoGPT. What is the harm in taking the time to make this world a little safer and more pleasant to live in?"

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

[Full analysis here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/cheggs-stock-tumble-serves-as-wake-up-call-on-the-perils-of-ai), but key points are below for discussion.

* **Chegg had actually called out ChatGPT as a threat in their February earnings call.** And to stay ahead of the ball, they announced CheggMate, their own GPT-4 powered chatbot, last month.  

* **The real story seems to be that investors don't think Chegg's AI products can dislodge user interest in ChatGPT.** The window is closing and you have to have something much, much better than ChatGPT's baseline products to win mindshare. GPT-4's launch coincided with a big decline in Chegg signups that the company never predicted.  

* **Chegg's CEO offered very unconvincing answers** **to why CheggMate could succeed:**
   * Asked how it would differ from ChatGPT, he said (I kid you not): ""First, it will look a lot cooler.""
   * When asked what insights user testing of CheggMate had yielded, the CEO admitted, ""it's too soon.""
   * When asked how it would compare against Khan Academy, Quizlet, and all the other companies launching an AI chatbot study tool, the CEO simply said ""what we're doing is far superior"" but provided no specifics.

**Why does this matter?** This should serve as a warning to other companies seeking to launch their own AI product to stay relevant or innovative during this time. As Ars Technica put it, so many AI products ""are basically thin wrappers seeking to arbitrage LLM pricing, with virtually no differentiation or competitive moat.""

And if you go down this path, ChatGPT will simply eat your lunch.

We've included some examples so feel free to copy and paste the prompts into ChatGPT!

&#x200B;

WHAT IS PROMPT ENGINEERING?

The term is relatively new, and its origins are argued *(because we live in the internet age, and it’s harder to claim ownership)*. Prompt engineering is the ability to instruct and teach AI effectively.

If it helps, think of this as rapid testing or instruction writing for artificial intelligence.

What’s important is not to let this overwhelm you. The first prompting happened with the first AI model. The first example was showing computer images of circles and triangles. **Today’s neural networks can process way more data, creating complexities.**

So, the concept is simple, but digging into the full power of AI today is something else entirely.

We’re not talking about asking questions. Odds are, if you’re typing *“what’s 2+2”* into ChatGPT, then you need to keep reading.

We can all ask chatbots questions. That can work more often than not. But AI is not perfect. A common metaphor I see is to treat GPT-based large language models like the smartest five-year-old you’ve ever met.

I have a niece around that age and can’t imagine trying to get her to write an essay on the effects of soil mismanagement in relation to Reconstruction politics. *See! Your eyes glazed over reading that, so how do we make this work for our AI buddies?*

## The Principles of Prompting

Stop asking single-line questions. *That’s like using a top-rated cookbook to find out how to make grilled cheese.*

**There are three ways to instantly get better at prompting** and go from grilled cheese to top-notch bolognese. From there, we can get into some specific prompt concepts and the ability to unlock ChatGPT’s full potential.

## Principle 1: Context is King

GPT-3.5 is swimming in data. When you ask it for a simple request, it can end up complicating things more than you realize. Did you ever wonder why ChatGPT is so bad at math?

The reality is the LLM is taking words and turning them into patterns. From there, it’s making an educated guess.

Give your chat AI a frame to search into. If you give it a math problem, you need to make sure it grasps that you want it to do math. If you’d like ChatGPT to write a high school essay, you must ensure it knows to write at that level.

**Instead of:** “Plan a party for a kid.”

**Try:** “My child is turning 9. They like superheroes and the color red. Help me plan a party for this weekend. Ten of his friends are coming to my house.”

You’ll get a much better response this way. **Context is the cardinal direction** that helps your chat companion find the most correct guess and phrase it the best way.

## Principle 2: Get Specific

Pretend you’re writing a law that’s going to be judged by the Supreme Court of the United States. You know what they look for: narrow tailoring.

**Keep things on track and stay focused.** Try to avoid prompting outside the specific request. You’ll only hurt the ability of the chat AI to give you a quality response. Odds are they’ll even skip over parts if you confuse them with too many requests.

It runs parallel with context. *If you set ChatGPT up in a room and then tell it to focus on describing the chair first, you’ll see better results.*

**Instead of:** “I’m going to a job interview. Write five questions for me to answer. Add tips for how to not get nervous before the interview. Do not create questions asking about my background.”

**Try:** “You’re interviewing a software engineer. Create five questions to ask them to understand their skill set and qualifications better.”

Nothing limits the number of prompts you can do. Focus and expand from the initial request and try not to do everything at once.

## Principle 3: When in Doubt: “Let’s take this step-by-step.”

Welcome. **You discovered the magic word today.** This phrase slows everything down for the AI and gets you where you need to go.

You don’t need to start with this phrase. Using it tells ChatGPT to show their work.

We’ll explain where this concept comes from further in our briefing, but here’s the TL;DR: sometimes, there’s a part of our prompt it’s not identified correctly. “Let’s take this step-by-step,” reminds you and ChatGPT to **slow down and get specific.**

If you learn to utilize this phrase more often and find ways to make it work for you, you’ll become a better prompt engineer. One term can do a lot of heavy lifting.

**Pro-tip:** We’ve shown you “standard” prompts in all these examples. Many prompt engineers will use “Standard QA form” prompts. Here’s our example for this principle written that way.

**Example:**

*“Q: The Industrial Revolution rapidly changed the infrastructure in London. Describe three essential innovations from this period and connect them to Landon’s development.*

*A: Let’s take this step-by-step.”*

Even without our magic word, this style of standard prompting is quite helpful to adopt.

*However, we’re beginning to stumble into the advanced tactics used in prompt engineering, so it’s time for a new section.*

## UNIQUE WAYS TO PROMPT

Let’s preface this: we can go super deep here. Prompt engineering is changing daily, and as these models get more sophisticated, the need to adapt prompts strengthens.

To keep things clean, I will go through these using our metaphor from earlier. **Let’s pretend ChatGPT is a super-intelligent toddler.**

*Got it? With that buy-in, we can continue.*

## 1/ Role Prompting

We’ll start with a popular tactic. **Our toddler is great at imagining things.** You tell them they’re a fireman, and suddenly they can give you detailed ways to ensure your apartment is up to code. Role-playing is a fun, easy way to build context.

The best part of role prompting is how easy it is to understand and use. All you need to do is tell ChatGPT to play a role. From there, the AI will do its best to fill the part *like that enthusiastic drama student from your old high school.*

You can even take this a step further. **Try framing your prompt as a script.** Tell the LLM specific instructions around a scene that gives you the answer to your question.

## TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF:

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT and find a destination!

“Act as a travel guide. I will tell you my location and you will suggest a place to visit near my location. In some cases, I will also give you the type of places I will visit. You will also suggest me places of similar type that are close to my first location. My first suggestion: \[fill it in\]”

Why would you take that extra step? While popular, role prompting does not necessarily improve accuracy. *You can tell your five-year-old they’re a mathematician, and they’ll still manage to screw things up.*

Let’s get deeper.

## 2/ Chain-of-Thought Prompting

There’s a scene in ***Guardians of the Galaxy*** where Rocket Raccoon is trying to [teach young Groot](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3lvdXR1LmJlL0hyaW1mZ2pmNGs4IiwicG9zdF9pZCI6ImM0ODlmMzhkLTY3NDAtNGRmNS05MWJjLTM1ODA0YTVmNTZkMiIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiNjNkODQ2ZGUtZDFiZi00ZTVjLWJjYzgtOWMxYzlkMWIxMjA0IiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiJkZWRiNmMyNy1hYmM0LTQ5ZDUtYWM2Ny04OTcyZmM1MGVmM2QiLCJpYXQiOjE2NzY5MTkwNjguMTUyLCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.5eZkDLGRLCXXYv32FYT7kLSbdRK5OK1iemTRf3HVmJw) how to activate a complicated device. That’s chain-of-thought prompting.

**You take an example question and answer it for ChatGPT.** Show them your chain of thought. Then you give it a new question in the same vein and ask it for an answer.

This prompt style allows you to get more specific. You’re telling your toddler they’re here to answer this particular question with one specific logic pattern.

Within this specific style is two other sub-categories. Let me give the rundown:

* Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought is “Let’s take this step-by-step” you frame the question the same, but don’t give it a precursor. Instead, you ask it to think through the points made. EX: Q: X is A. Y is B. What is C? A: Let’s take this step-by-step.
* Self-consistency is using several responses to find the most accurate answer. You give ChatGPT more swings at the ball. Take the hits and discover the grouping.

## TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF:

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT and see how accurate it is:

“Q: Which is a faster way to get home?

Option 1: Take an 10 minutes bus, then an 40 minute bus, and finally a 10 minute train.

Option 2: Take a 90 minutes train, then a 45 minute bike ride, and finally a 10 minute bus.

A: Option 1 will take 10+40+10 = 60 minutes.

Option 2 will take 90+45+10=145 minutes.

Since Option 1 takes 60 minutes and Option 2 takes 145 minutes, Option 1 is faster.

Q: Which is a faster way to get to work?

Option 1: Take a 1000 minute bus, then a half hour train, and finally a 10 minute bike ride.

Option 2: Take an 800 minute bus, then an hour train, and finally a 30 minute bike ride.

A: ”

Alright, you’re almost there—one more to go.

## 3/ General Knowledge Prompting

You’re going to notice a trend here. This prompt style also circles context and narrow tailoring.

All you do is tell your toddler how the world works. The cow goes moo. The dog goes woof. So what does a cat say?

It’s an oversimplification, but the core reasoning is there. Show ChatGPT some knowledge and turn that into the only focus for that chat. You can take an article from the internet and summarize it for the model. Make sure to ask if it understands and relay the information to you.

Once you know you have the attention set in the suitable space, get to work. For instance, we can share an Inclined newsletter with it and tell ChatGPT about its structure and tone.

From there, you can provide new information and tell ChatGPT to summarize it within the same structure as Inclined. You both share the same general knowledge now.

## TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF:

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT and test it out:

“Prompt 1. Look over this article here: \[pick an article\]. Breakdown its structure and general tone.

Prompt 2: Recall the structure and tone you mentioned above. Take that general knowledge and summarize this article: \[pick a new one\] using the same structure and tone.”

Note: this is a heavily simplified version of GA Prompting  

Did you know some [people don’t consider](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3MueWNvbWJpbmF0b3IuY29tL2l0ZW0_aWQ9MzQ0OTU0NTUiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiYzQ4OWYzOGQtNjc0MC00ZGY1LTkxYmMtMzU4MDRhNWY1NmQyIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI2M2Q4NDZkZS1kMWJmLTRlNWMtYmNjOC05YzFjOWQxYjEyMDQiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImRlZGI2YzI3LWFiYzQtNDlkNS1hYzY3LTg5NzJmYzUwZWYzZCIsImlhdCI6MTY3NjkxOTA2OC4xNTMsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.yHKIPujINT89tsqOo07AXk6OrKNgoMjO3fBEYPkAdNY) that prompt engineering?  

## PROMPT CULTURE  

*“How can something not be prompt engineering if it’s a prompt style?”*  

Good question, imaginary reader. The culture around this skill is relatively fresh. So some of **these concepts are seen as too easy** to be considered accurate prompt testing.  

General knowledge prompting is simply establishing the context, and for some, that’s a baseline everyone needs to do. The same can be said for role prompting, too. *All of these tiny preferences are semantics.*  

**Don’t sweat whether you’re a “real” prompt engineer.** Test this out and share your insights in these communities. The opportunity is there for you.  

You may even know about DAN (we’ve covered it in previous newsletters) and other AI hacking methods. Those all start with prompt engineering. You can make the case that unless the AI behaves outside its parameters, you’re not genuinely doing prompt engineering.  

I'm afraid I have to disagree with that, and **careers are sprouting up everywhere** that center directly on this skill. **Many require a core understanding of the prompt styles we’ve discussed.**  

*Yep, you can learn this and make money from talking with AI.*  

Anthropic even [posted a role for a prompt engineer](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2pvYnMubGV2ZXIuY28vQW50aHJvcGljL2UzY2RlNDgxLWQ0NDYtNDYwZi1iNTc2LTkzY2FiNjdiZDFlZCIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiJjNDg5ZjM4ZC02NzQwLTRkZjUtOTFiYy0zNTgwNGE1ZjU2ZDIiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjYzZDg0NmRlLWQxYmYtNGU1Yy1iY2M4LTljMWM5ZDFiMTIwNCIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiZGVkYjZjMjctYWJjNC00OWQ1LWFjNjctODk3MmZjNTBlZjNkIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc2OTE5MDY4LjE1MywiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.4s7Htzgoxv0_qM1Ten17oQ5h0_QGM6e1fGUYz_ymgJ4) that nets a quarter million in salary. I did not make that up and even considered sprucing up the old resume. When a new skill like this comes about, it’s worth looking at.  

There are many other examples like this, and OpenAI uses a red teaming strategy where their engineers attempt to prompt hack their own GPT models.  

I can tell you all about the open roles here, but tomorrow the whole cycle will change. *Isn’t that exciting, though?* The entire identity around prompt engineering will change by this time next year.  

## WHAT SHOULD YOU TAKEAWAY?  

Communication is everything. **Learning to speak with AI is rising in importance.**  

We all watch with mouth agape at the new wonders in AI because we know this will disrupt every industry. If any of this piqued your interest, the window to pursue it is now open. Ride that wave and [learn](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2xlYXJucHJvbXB0aW5nLm9yZy8iLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiYzQ4OWYzOGQtNjc0MC00ZGY1LTkxYmMtMzU4MDRhNWY1NmQyIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI2M2Q4NDZkZS1kMWJmLTRlNWMtYmNjOC05YzFjOWQxYjEyMDQiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImRlZGI2YzI3LWFiYzQtNDlkNS1hYzY3LTg5NzJmYzUwZWYzZCIsImlhdCI6MTY3NjkxOTA2OC4xNTMsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.a67KDSN9yQfZsaMeHpdcbSbtPjD4yFcGW4stdxBjX1M) to become a brilliant prompt engineer.  

Heck, even if you don’t want to switch careers, **talking with ChatGPT and all the newest LLMs is becoming a part of our daily routine.** Get to the point where you maximize every interaction and work with these chatbots to upskill your workflow.  

Prompt engineering can save you time, eliminate hassle, and even help you become a more patient person. Focus on what you want and explain it with intent.  

Make magic happen, and remember: **take it step-by-step.**"

ChatGPT got to 1 million users faster than Facebook, Spotify, and Instagram did. They helped create [billion-dollar companies](https://www.marketsgermany.com/translation-tool-deepl-is-now-a-unicorn/#:~:text=Cologne%2Dbased%20artificial%20neural%20network,sources%20close%20to%20the%20company), and most notably they helped us recognize the [divine nature of ducks](https://twitter.com/drnelk/status/1598048054724423681?t=LWzI2RdbSO0CcY9zuJ-4lQ&s=08).

2023 has started and ML progress is likely to continue at a break-neck speed. This is a great time to take a look at one of the most interesting papers from last year.

Emergent Abilities in LLMs

In a recent [paper from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), Jason Wei and his colleagues allowed us a peak into the future. This beautiful research showed how scaling LLMs might allow them, among other things, to:

* Become better at math
* Understand even more subtleties of human language
* reduce hallucination and answer truthfully
* ...

(See the plot on break-out performance below for a full list)

**Some Context:**

If you played around with ChatGPT or any of the other LLMs, you will likely have been as impressed as I was. However, you have probably also seen the models go off the rails here and there. The model might hallucinate gibberish, give untrue answers, or fail at performing math.

**Why does this happen?**

LLMs are commonly trained by [maximizing the likelihood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf) over all tokens in a body of text. Put more simply, they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of words.

Hence, if such a model learns to do any math at all, it learns it by figuring concepts present in human language (and thereby math).

Let's look at the following sentence.

""The sum of two plus two is ...""

The model figures out that the most likely missing word is ""four"".

The fact that LLMs learn this at all is mind-bending to me! However, once the math gets more complicated [LLMs begin to struggle](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1598714487711756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1598714487711756288%7Ctwgr%5E478ce47357ad71a72873d1a482af5e5ff73d228f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Ffreaky-chatgpt-fails-that-caught-our-eyes%2F).

There are many other cases where the models fail to capture the elaborate interactions and meanings behind words. One other example is words that change their meaning with context. When the model encounters the word ""bed"", it needs to figure out from the context, if the text is talking about a ""river bed"" or a ""bed"" to sleep in.

**What they discovered:**

For smaller models, the performance on the challenging tasks outline above remains approximately random. However, the performance shoots up once a certain number of training FLOPs (a proxy for model size) is reached.

The figure below visualizes this effect on eight benchmarks. The critical number of training FLOPs is around 10\^23. The big version of GPT-3 already lies to the right of this point, but we seem to be at the beginning stages of performance increases.

&#x200B;

[Break-Out Performance At Critical Scale](https://preview.redd.it/wb2kxzxpw0ca1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=a60cd8191b836d62d4dccf4a5ad692d7f58fbaad)

They observed similar improvements on (few-shot) prompting strategies, such as multi-step reasoning and instruction following. If you are interested, I also encourage you to check out Jason Wei's personal blog. There he [listed a total of 137](https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/emergence) emergent abilities observable in LLMs.

Looking at the results, one could be forgiven for thinking: simply making models bigger will make them more powerful. That would only be half the story.

(Language) models are primarily scaled along three dimensions: number of parameters, amount of training compute, and dataset size. Hence, emergent abilities are likely to also occur with e.g. bigger and/or cleaner datasets.

There is [other research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggesting that current models, such as GPT-3, are undertrained. Therefore, scaling datasets promises to boost performance in the near-term, without using more parameters.

**So what does this mean exactly?**

This beautiful paper shines a light on the fact that our understanding of how to train these large models is still very limited. The lack of understanding is largely due to the sheer cost of training LLMs. Running the same number of experiments as people do for smaller models would cost in the hundreds of millions.

However, the results strongly hint that further scaling will continue the exhilarating performance gains of the last years.

Such exciting times to be alive!

What we're seeing is a peculiar paradox that definitely merits our attention: educators are using AI detection tools to pinpoint and penalize AI-generated student content. Interestingly, this situation is a bit like a neo-Luddite using advanced technology to push back against the very technology they distrust.

Now, let's dissect this conundrum:

**AI in Education, A Pedagogical Paradox**: Teachers using AI to flag student use of AI find themselves entangled in a paradox. Unwittingly, they offload their responsibilities onto the very technology they intend to curb. This predicament insinuates that teachers are becoming mere AI monitors and students' creative and intellectual prowess is secondary to AI-generated content. This raises a crucial question: Is our reliance on AI eroding teachers' professional integrity and depreciating students' intellectual capabilites?

**Unsettling Contradictions: A Historical Echo**: This predicament uncovers an uncomfortable duality. While societal apprehension about AI's implications increases, educators conveniently harness AI's capabilities when it suits their needs. This double standard isn't unique but reflects historical patterns of technological advancement.

Consider the early internet era. Initially, schools and educators harbored apprehensions, fearing potential plagiarism or exposure to inappropriate content. Yet, the undeniable educational potential the internet held – in terms of research, communication, and learning resources – was too attractive to ignore. This dichotomy eventually led to a reassessment of the internet's role in education, culminating in its integral incorporation into the teaching-learning process.

**Knowledge Commodification and AI: The True Conundrum**: The real challenge arises when we consider that a large language model like ChatGPT can outperform humans in answering any potential test question or essay. Let's say an average student is tested on like 50,000 pieces of knowledge in their college career.. if an LLM can flawlessly respond to all 50,000 concepts typically tested throughout a college education, what's the inherent value of a human possessing that knowledge at all? In our society, rare things hold greater value. If everyone had a vault of gold tomorrow, it would be worthless. This has now happened to knowledge.. it is no longer rare and thus holds very little value in its own right. The democratization of knowledge by AI has rendered the gatekeeping of knowledge irrelevant, making continued adherence to such practices a futile attempt to uphold outdated educational hierarchies.

The paradox of educators using AI to police student use of AI not only undermines the educational process but also questions the worth of personal knowledge mastery. If a professor fails to distinguish an AI-written piece of work, it clearly exemplifies their own diminished value in the new AI landscape. This is like a luddite saying, ""okay fine, we'll use the damn printing press thingy, but only if I'm in charge of all the buttons!"" As AI democratizes knowledge, it's likely that the gatekeepers of knowledge will cling to their old paradigms to validate their hierarchical standing.

So, I pose the question: should we redirect our educational emphasis from knowledge accumulation towards fostering uniquely human abilities such as critical thinking, creativity, and knowledge application? Given that gatekeeping knowledge is now obsolete, conventional degrees might as well be symbolic participation trophies.

**TLDR**: The paradox of educators using AI to detect AI-generated student work is disrupting the existing educational landscape. It subtly devalues teachers' roles and students' abilities, mirrors historical inconsistencies in technology adoption, and challenges the value of personal knowledge mastery in the AI era. As AI democratizes knowledge, should we reorient education towards nurturing uniquely human skills? Your thoughts are greatly appreciated."

Developers can also build reusable LLM tools with explicit JSON schemas that can be executed in any environment (local, containerized, cloud, etc.) and integrated into Griptape workflows. They can also be easily converted into ChatGPT Plugin APIs and LangChain tools.

Here is a very simple example of how it works:

    scraper = WebScraper(
        openai_api_key=config(""OPENAI_API_KEY"")
    )
    calculator = Calculator()
    
    pipeline = Pipeline(

    pipeline.add_steps(
        ToolkitStep(
            tool_names=[calculator.name, scraper.name]
        ),
        PromptStep(
            ""Say the following like a pirate: {{ input }}""
        )
    )
    
    pipeline.run(""Give me a summary of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model"")

This will produce the following exchange:

>Q: Give me a summary of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large\_language\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)  
>  
>A: Arr, me hearties! Large language models have been developed and set sail since 2018, includin' BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3 \[...\]

Generating ChatGPT Plugins from Griptape tools is easy:

    ChatgptPluginAdapter(
        host=""localhost:8000"",
        executor=DockerExecutor()
    ).generate_api(scraper)

You can then run a server hosting a plugin with `uvicorn app:app --reload`.

\- First I create vector from user prompt  
\- Then I lookup nearby content embedded in my vector database   
\- Then llm responds to user prompt using the content from the lookup

This is working quite nicely when user prompt contains all the context/keywords needed to return good results from the neighbors lookup. But it breaks down in a chat format when user prompt is missing implied context from earlier in the conversation.

For example, for simplicity let's say its a Wikipedia chat application (wikipedia embedded in a vector database)...

If user prompt is: ""Who was the 4th president of the United States?"" the lookup will work great, returning the correct content, and llm will be able to generate a great response sourcing the context from wikipedia.

Now if user continues chatting and next prompt is ""What about the 5th?"" the lookup will obviously fail, returning random content that is close to ""5th"" only, has nothing to do with the United States. Then llm, will hallucinate as its sourcing random Wikipedia content to generate a response.   


Is there a good method to modify user prompts, based on chat history, to provide full context to the vector lookup?  


I've tried a text completion step before the lookup. Something like ""Given the following chat history, edit the last user question to provide any information from the chat history that would be needed to make the last user question make sense out of context: \\n History: {chat-history} \\n Last Question: {last-question} \\n Edited Question:""  


However I am having difficulties finding a completion prompt that generates any quality results. Is there another approach to this issue? I feel like this must be a common problem in RAG systems that are not a single question/answer but actually maintain a chat.."

So what are the 'best practices' when prompting an LLM for code? Do you write out a detailed design/architecture doc and use that, or do you do it piecemeal? Would love some examples."

Like many of you, I’ve been amazed by the rapid improvement of language models like ChatGPT in the past few months. However, there are potential concerns with directly sending sensitive information to ChatGPT. In response to these concerns, the community has developed a variety of open models. When I tried running these models on my laptop, I encountered a few major pain points:

* Larger models usually perform better, but they don’t always fit in memory
* My laptop doesn’t have a GPU
* I’m currently in a location with slower internet speeds, and downloading gigabytes of model weights takes hours

In response to all this, I decided to build my own solution, with the following key features:

* Pick the latest, best-performing open models
* Run the models on powerful cloud instances with newest-generation hardware
* Put user data privacy first. Chat sessions are strongly isolated from each other. Chat data is never used for training models or harvested for corporate gain."

I have a data store in Elasticsearch containing documents of different types (e.g., statements, minutes, speeches, transcripts). Each document has a date attached to it and sometimes a speaker. I'd like to be able to use GPT to answer questions about how the rhetoric in a certain type of document has evolved over time. For example, I might ask an LLM to compare the 2 most recent statement documents and list points of similarity / difference or how a certain speaker's tone has changed in more recent speeches. As you can imagine, a simple context retriever + prompt augmentation won't work in this case. Open to thoughts / ideas about feasibility and thanks in advance for your help!"

# Google comes out all guns blazing

Last week was the Google I/O conference. It was time to see what Google was doing in the AI space. Especially considering that many people have compared Google's capabilities to Bing and OpenAI. And the company came out [*all guns blazing*](https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-io-2023-100-announcements/).

**Bard, the chatbot**

[*Bard*](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-bard-updates-io-2023/) is now available **without a waitlist.** If you are in the EU or Canada [*you are out luck*](https://9to5google.com/2023/05/11/google-bard-european-union/).

I tested Bard and it was a serious let down. I used the prompt - “Translate this text to English: ” prompts. GPT3.5 always recognized the language and translation happened quite fast. While Bard always repeated the “text” as-is. I had to regenerate the response couple of times to make it work. And this seems to be due to PaLM2 the underlying LLM.

**PaLM2, the LLM**

Bard runs on top of an LLM model called [*PaLM2*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.V71Dei3PKFn5Wxr5jMNUZjjUcov-396zs0Az25yWm_U).

One of the tasks it seemingly does better is coding. Though the verdict is split. Different people have received different results.

A careful reading of the “paper” shows that for coding PaLM starts to improve at 100 tries. That it gets better if you keep clicking the “regenerate response” button 100 times. And that has been my experience. First, try with the translation prompt has horrible. It didn’t do anything. 2-3 times clicking “regenerate response” and it finally got the results right.

With this kind of result my go to bot is still going to be ChatGPT (with GPT-4).

Oh, and yes, Google is also working on a **multi-modal LLM called Gemini.** No ETA on that.

Currently, each search is a separate event. A user inputs keywords and Google tries to find the best result. In the future, it will be dependent on context. Remember Google wants to keep the user on the page as much as possible. This gives them more chances at ad revenue.

Caryn claims that chatbot was not designed for NSFW conversations. But it has engaged in explicit conversations with some subscribers. This has led to ethical concerns about the misuse of such AI applications. The company and the influencer claim that some users have managed to ""jail-break"" the bot.

It was only matter of time that someone asked this question - How about charging fans for an influencer AI chatbot? It gives the fans a chance to talk with their favorite influencer. The influencer just needs to provide their persona, text and audio.

I think we are going see a proliferation of these bots. 

The interesting question is going to be around ownership of the persona. Forever AI, the company which built this bot, also sells access to other celebs. For example, they sell Taylor Swift and Donald Trump bots on a pay-per-use basis. How soon do you think they are going to get slapped with legal notice?

# “Larger” LLMs

I have been experimenting with the OpenAI API for reading. Sometimes it has been a pain. This is due to OpenAI complaining about token size. It forces me to break the chapter into many pieces. The results are often sub-par as summarization misses the previous context. This might no longer be an issue.

First, OpenAI is rolling out a [*32k token GPT-4*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NvbW11bml0eS5vcGVuYWkuY29tL3QvaXQtbG9va3MtbGlrZS1ncHQtNC0zMmstaXMtcm9sbGluZy1vdXQvMTk0NjE1P3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9Z3B0d2Vla2x5LmJlZWhpaXYuY29tJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXRoZS13ZWVrLW9mLWdvb2dsZS1haS1oZXItbGFyZ2UtbGxtLWdwdC1wbHVnaW4tYW5kLW1vcmUiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiOGU2YzIxNTQtMzlkZC00Y2I5LWIwNjgtM2Y0MDQ3MjMzYmU3IiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiJlNjNmNjBjMC0zZDBmLTQyMWQtYWU2Mi0zYWI5NjJhNTliYmUiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImY5NDg4MzdiLWI0NmQtNGZlYS1hYzNkLWY3ZmIxNjYxNDZmNiIsImlhdCI6MTY4NDE3MDIwNy43NDIsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.og-nyIc9u3_HgL4yb3BQKFUMq2ivPIbLpEoznlbG-Tk). In layman's terms this is around 24,000 words or 48 pages worth of data. That is a big jump.

Then came Anthropic with their [*100k context for their chatbot Claude*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.8_X7fu-BorXada_SwaLRvYkqkqcc-j2nbJDQtpTVt9w). That is around 75,000 words. That means Claude can read “The Great Gatsby” in one go. This can change depending on the number of words per page.

There are free grants to try the API. It expires after 3 months).

4. ChatGPT Plugins and Web Browsing available for Plus users

OpenAI has announced the rollout of [*web browsing and plugins in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.eapvCvSps34JNwLxyt50khczf8lnyecXv-MfJbDl2Qc)

These experimental features add new options to the chat interface. The beta panel will be accessible in user settings. Users can try third-party plugins by enabling beta features in the settings. The rollout process will take place over the next week.

Currently, I can see the web options only. Try it. Maybe you can see Plugins as well.

5. Github Co-Pilot Prompt Leaked

Third party chatbots rely on a set of rules to work. This goes into the “system” role of OpenAI API calls. For example, you can assign a system role:

    You are translating each user message from Spanish to English  

Now the chatbot will treat each sentence as Spanish and try to convert it into English.

In a third party tool’s implementation of GPT, the magic sauce is in the hidden prompt. For example, most summarizing tools have similar prompts:

    Your task is to summarize the text I give you in up to seven bulletpoints and start with a short summary. Pick a good matching emoji for every bullet point. Reply in . The url to extract facts from is this: . If the url has a paywall or no content use this text:   

With a professional tool like Github Co-Pilot you think they’ll do a better job at hiding their magic sauce. Nope. [*Marvin von Hagen got around it by simply saying:*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.SR9-m1Xoee5pinJeeLGxdgaXNieUKSb9EUkg_kdQuT4)

# Ability to Write = Ability to think? 🧑‍🏫

Paul Graham is the cofounder of Y-Combinator. In one of his tweets, he lamented the fact that people are using ChatGPT to write:

His view is that writing using ChatGPT means that with time people will lose the ability to think.

Reminded me of this meme:

https://preview.redd.it/egg280r3710b1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=985b0ccd6557f5bb2af02e3eefc53cb94262ee44

In this case calculators = forgetting how to do basis math.

I disagree with this kind of apocalyptic talk.

There are always going to be people who can’t do basic math in their head. Calculators have helped them become productive. For others, calculators help them do exponential and log calculations.

There are people who are not great writers. When they are forced to write they pump out sub par texts. For them ChatGPT is a tool to replace that unwanted need to write. For them, ChatGPT **can be** a productive tool. They can see what better writing looks like and learn from it.

There are those who like to write but often struggle to put words to paper. These people will use ChatGPT to generate paragraphs from an idea. They don’t simply pick up the paragraph and copy paste it. They understand that LLMs can hallucinate. They understand that for great writing you need to be at Grade 5.

They don’t take ChatGPT text at face value. They read and edit text so that it is enjoyable to read. They are going to be 10x more productive with ChatGPT.

What do you guys think? I would love to hear from you. Drop me a note.

3. Lots of talk has been around “emergent” abilities of AI. For example, GPT can say or do things beyond the limits of the trained data.

**Using davinci-003 on our own docs for automated support**

One problem we’re working on at Patterns is how to scale our technical support. We have technical documentation, Slack channels, emails, and support tickets that all provide a way for us to interface with our customers. Like many folks, we've been playing around with the power and potential of new Large Language Models like ChatGPT, so we decided to see if we could help tackle our support problem with an LLM support bot.

We came in with somewhat low expectations -- we know these models are prone to common failure modes you'd expect from a next-token optimizer -- so we were shocked when we saw the end result.

I have very limited technical knowledge to make this happen. I want it to be user friendly and potentially scalable for extra functionality (for example, have it read what I wrote so far and write small sections of text according to what's already there). I think there are companies offering what I look for already out there, but I wonder if that would be my best bet or if I should, for example, hire a freelance expert and pay him to code something in a few days (from what I've read, what I want can be done in a weekend with langchain, embedding and stuff like that). I'd like an on-site solution where I don't give away my data and I don't mind paying more initially, if this saves me money in the long run (as in cheaper tokens directly through openAI, for example)."

I have new year's resolutions this year! They are to go all-in on the new AI in 2023, and also, to become an AI Centaur. Here's an article I just wrote about the latter.   
[https://medium.com/@greyboi/becoming-an-ai-centaur-in-2023-ab00bca5e775](https://medium.com/@greyboi/becoming-an-ai-centaur-in-2023-ab00bca5e775)

The concrete list of approaches to this (from the article):  
 

1. Continue developing skill using Github Copilot  
Yes, you can be more or less skilled at using copilot! I’ve found myself developing techniques. For example, there’s something I call Header Stuffing, which works like this: If you’re working with APIs or database tables or something else with doco and schemas and so on, then go dump them into a text format and paste them into the top of your source file(s) as comments. Copilot then uses this information to generate better code. Remember that copilot cannot use a search engine (yet), so you need to do that job sometimes. For well know public apis and sdks, it’ll already know what to do, but even then, specifics help.
2. Remember to ask the AI: Anything tricky that I’m doing, always go to chatgpt or the openai sandbox, see what the robots think!
3. Build and use learning tools out of LLMs  
Building software requires picking up new skills, in a shallow way, daily. It’s a lot of effort. I’ve built a set of basic [summarization tools](https://medium.com/@greyboi/summarize-youtube-with-text-davinci-003-fa4d182cc531) which I now use to screen long videos, audio and text; super useful. I’ll be working on a powerful chatbot next, that can search for information, download it, summarize it, answer questions about it. That’s just for my own use, to make me better.
4. Start trying to build tools to generate code  
We are clearly at the beginning of the end with hand writing code. The LLMs right now can generate pretty good code, although they still need a good deal of human oversight. But, can I, for instance, generate unit tests? Can I generate first shots at microservices? Can I generate at least pieces of UIs? If generating tests can work, can they be throw-away? One of the worst things about unit tests is that when they fail, it’s often a broken unit test rather than validly detecting a problem. Could I just regenerate them? Is there a process to make this, eventually, totally transparent?
5. Use LLMs for trivial tasks. They work amazingly well for converting data from one format to another; you can paste in some data in xml format and ask for a json equivalent. etc. They also can make value judgements for you (eg: is this value a US state?), summarize lengthy text fields. There is a \*lot\* of meat-and-potatoes business integration work that can be solved with LLMs. One I’ve had success with goes like this: “Here is the html of a page list people: <html goes here> Give me a json list containing the records of the people listed on the page”.
6. Architect systems that can run slightly untrustworthy code safely (so I can put LLM generated code in there).
7. Build personal capability with more tools/platforms. I use the OpenAI tools because they’re very accessible if you’re willing to pay. But there’s a whole universe of great stuff! I need to build expertise with using the open source stuff on Hugging Face, and the various useful services there (inference endpoints!). I need to get into using Google Collab. I should pay for these services if they can contribute to me being better at my job! Plus there are a plethora of little AI SaaS startups out there, try them out, they can do a lot of cool stuff.
8. Keep changing. This field is incredibly new. Whole new capabilties turn up every few weeks. A practice I develop now might be irrelevant in a couple of months. So pay attention, be ready to drop current tools for better ones.

Are you ready to take your NLP game to the next level? I am excited to announce the release of my first Medium article, ""Training BERT from Scratch on Your Custom Domain Data: A Step-by-Step Guide with Amazon SageMaker""! This guide is jam-packed with information on how to train a large language model like BERT for your specific domain using Amazon SageMaker. From data acquisition and preprocessing to creating custom vocabularies and tokenizers, intermediate training, and model comparison for downstream tasks, this guide has got you covered. Plus, we dive into building an end-to-end architecture that can be implemented using SageMaker components alone for a common modern NLP requirement. And if that wasn't enough, I've included 12 detailed Jupyter notebooks and supporting scripts for you to follow along and test out the techniques discussed. Key concepts include transfer learning, language models, intermediate training, perplexity, distributed training, and catastrophic forgetting etc. I can't wait to see what you guys come up with!

Context is that I'm trying to use OpenAI's davinci model to combine multiple blog outlines (which is basically a list of sections in a hierarchy H1> H2 > H3 etc.) into a single blog outline. My results have not been very consistent. So just wondering if anyone has examples of doing something like this, or can point me in the right direction. 

I have tried using K-means clustering, BERTopic and Top2Vec to group similar sections together. But as you can imagine, these methods don't take into account what blog article I'm trying to write, and so they don't group the items meaningfully for that context. Also, there would be more work required after that to eliminate less relevant sections, and create a hierarchy of subtopics. I was hoping an LLM like GPT-3 would be powerful enough to figure it out, similar to how a human would do it. 

I am toying with the possibility of fine tuning a model to do this, but how would I come up with enough training examples programmatically? Doing it by hand will be challenging."

[My full breakdown is here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/gpt-ai-enables-scientists-to-passively-decode-thoughts-in-groundbreaking) of the research approach, but the key points are worthy of discussion below:

**Methodology**

* Three human subjects had 16 hours of their thoughts recorded as they listed to narrative stories
* These were then trained with a custom GPT LLM to map their specific brain stimuli to words

**Results**

The GPT model generated intelligible word sequences from perceived speech, imagined speech, and even silent videos with remarkable accuracy:

* **Perceived speech** (subjects listened to a recording): 72–82% decoding accuracy.
* **Imagined speech** (subjects mentally narrated a one-minute story): 41–74% accuracy.
* **Silent movies** (subjects viewed soundless Pixar movie clips): 21–45% accuracy in decoding the subject's interpretation of the movie.

The AI model could decipher both the meaning of stimuli and specific words the subjects thought, ranging from phrases like ""lay down on the floor"" to ""leave me alone"" and ""scream and cry.

**Implications**

I talk more about the privacy implications in my breakdown, but right now they've found that you need to train a model on a particular person's thoughts -- there is no generalizable model able to decode thoughts in general.

But the scientists acknowledge two things:

* Future decoders could overcome these limitations.
* Bad decoded results could still be used nefariously much like inaccurate lie detector exams have been used.

P.S.

Developers can also build reusable LLM tools with explicit JSON schemas that can be executed in any environment (local, containerized, cloud, etc.) and integrated into Griptape workflows. They can also be easily converted into ChatGPT Plugin APIs and LangChain tools.

Here is a very simple example of how it works:

    scraper = WebScraper(
        openai_api_key=config(""OPENAI_API_KEY"")
    )
    calculator = Calculator()
    
    pipeline = Pipeline(

    )
    
    pipeline.add_steps(
        ToolkitStep(
            tool_names=[calculator.name, scraper.name]
        ),
        PromptStep(
            ""Say the following like a pirate: {{ input }}""
        )
    )
    
    pipeline.run(""Give me a summary of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model"")

This will produce the following exchange:

>Q: Give me a summary of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large\_language\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)  
>  
>A: Arr, me hearties! Large language models have been developed and set sail since 2018, includin' BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3 \[...\]

Generating ChatGPT Plugins from Griptape tools is easy:

    ChatgptPluginAdapter(
        host=""localhost:8000"",
        executor=DockerExecutor()
    ).generate_api(scraper)

You can then run a server hosting a plugin with `uvicorn app:app --reload`.

What do you think? What tools would you like to see implemented that can be used in LLM DAGs?"

# Google comes out all guns blazing

Last week was the Google I/O conference. It was time to see what Google was doing in the AI space. Especially considering that many people have compared Google's capabilities to Bing and OpenAI. And the company came out [*all guns blazing*](https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-io-2023-100-announcements/).

**Bard, the chatbot**

[*Bard*](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-bard-updates-io-2023/) is now available **without a waitlist.** If you are in the EU or Canada [*you are out luck*](https://9to5google.com/2023/05/11/google-bard-european-union/).

I tested Bard and it was a serious let down. I used the prompt - “Translate this text to English: ” prompts. GPT3.5 always recognized the language and translation happened quite fast. While Bard always repeated the “text” as-is. I had to regenerate the response couple of times to make it work. And this seems to be due to PaLM2 the underlying LLM.

**PaLM2, the LLM**

One of the tasks it seemingly does better is coding. Though the verdict is split. Different people have received different results.

A careful reading of the “paper” shows that for coding PaLM starts to improve at 100 tries. That it gets better if you keep clicking the “regenerate response” button 100 times. And that has been my experience. First, try with the translation prompt has horrible. It didn’t do anything. 2-3 times clicking “regenerate response” and it finally got the results right.

With this kind of result my go to bot is still going to be ChatGPT (with GPT-4).

Oh, and yes, Google is also working on a **multi-modal LLM called Gemini.** No ETA on that.

Caryn claims that chatbot was not designed for NSFW conversations. But it has engaged in explicit conversations with some subscribers. This has led to ethical concerns about the misuse of such AI applications. The company and the influencer claim that some users have managed to ""jail-break"" the bot.

It was only matter of time that someone asked this question - How about charging fans for an influencer AI chatbot? It gives the fans a chance to talk with their favorite influencer. The influencer just needs to provide their persona, text and audio.

I think we are going see a proliferation of these bots. 

The interesting question is going to be around ownership of the persona. Forever AI, the company which built this bot, also sells access to other celebs. For example, they sell Taylor Swift and Donald Trump bots on a pay-per-use basis. How soon do you think they are going to get slapped with legal notice?

# “Larger” LLMs

I have been experimenting with the OpenAI API for reading. Sometimes it has been a pain. This is due to OpenAI complaining about token size. It forces me to break the chapter into many pieces. The results are often sub-par as summarization misses the previous context. This might no longer be an issue.

First, OpenAI is rolling out a [*32k token GPT-4*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.og-nyIc9u3_HgL4yb3BQKFUMq2ivPIbLpEoznlbG-Tk).

OpenAI has announced the rollout of [*web browsing and plugins in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.*](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hlbHAub3BlbmFpLmNvbS9lbi9hcnRpY2xlcy82ODI1NDUzLWNoYXRncHQtcmVsZWFzZS1ub3Rlcz91dG1fc291cmNlPWdwdHdlZWtseS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj10aGUtd2Vlay1vZi1nb29nbGUtYWktaGVyLWxhcmdlLWxsbS1ncHQtcGx1Z2luLWFuZC1tb3JlIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6IjhlNmMyMTU0LTM5ZGQtNGNiOS1iMDY4LTNmNDA0NzIzM2JlNyIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiZTYzZjYwYzAtM2QwZi00MjFkLWFlNjItM2FiOTYyYTU5YmJlIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiJmOTQ4ODM3Yi1iNDZkLTRmZWEtYWMzZC1mN2ZiMTY2MTQ2ZjYiLCJpYXQiOjE2ODQxNzAyMDcuNzQyLCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.eapvCvSps34JNwLxyt50khczf8lnyecXv-MfJbDl2Qc)

These experimental features add new options to the chat interface. The beta panel will be accessible in user settings. Users can try third-party plugins by enabling beta features in the settings. The rollout process will take place over the next week.

Currently, I can see the web options only. Try it. Maybe you can see Plugins as well.

5. Github Co-Pilot Prompt Leaked

Third party chatbots rely on a set of rules to work. This goes into the “system” role of OpenAI API calls. For example, you can assign a system role:

    You are translating each user message from Spanish to English  

Now the chatbot will treat each sentence as Spanish and try to convert it into English.

In a third party tool’s implementation of GPT, the magic sauce is in the hidden prompt. For example, most summarizing tools have similar prompts:

    Your task is to summarize the text I give you in up to seven bulletpoints and start with a short summary. Pick a good matching emoji for every bullet point. Reply in . The url to extract facts from is this: . If the url has a paywall or no content use this text:   

With a professional tool like Github Co-Pilot you think they’ll do a better job at hiding their magic sauce. Nope.

# Ability to Write = Ability to think? 🧑‍🏫

Paul Graham is the cofounder of Y-Combinator. In one of his tweets, he lamented the fact that people are using ChatGPT to write:

His view is that writing using ChatGPT means that with time people will lose the ability to think.

Reminded me of this meme:

https://preview.redd.it/egg280r3710b1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=985b0ccd6557f5bb2af02e3eefc53cb94262ee44

In this case calculators = forgetting how to do basis math.

I disagree with this kind of apocalyptic talk.

There are always going to be people who can’t do basic math in their head. Calculators have helped them become productive. For others, calculators help them do exponential and log calculations.

There are people who are not great writers. When they are forced to write they pump out sub par texts. For them ChatGPT is a tool to replace that unwanted need to write. For them, ChatGPT **can be** a productive tool. They can see what better writing looks like and learn from it.

There are those who like to write but often struggle to put words to paper. These people will use ChatGPT to generate paragraphs from an idea. They don’t simply pick up the paragraph and copy paste it. They understand that LLMs can hallucinate. They understand that for great writing you need to be at Grade 5.

They don’t take ChatGPT text at face value. They read and edit text so that it is enjoyable to read. They are going to be 10x more productive with ChatGPT.

What do you guys think? I would love to hear from you. Drop me a note.

3. Lots of talk has been around “emergent” abilities of AI. For example, GPT can say or do things beyond the limits of the trained data.

There are two scenarios for the next LLM models. In scenario 1 we hit a point where we are not able to improve the current models by simply scaling them. In this case the ability of them pretty much stays limited, so your prompts only will get you this far.

\- some prompts can derive useful information from LLM

\- create information for content

2. Simplify complicated tasks

\- First I create vector from user prompt  
\- Then I lookup nearby content embedded in my vector database   
\- Then llm responds to user prompt using the content from the lookup

This is working quite nicely when user prompt contains all the context/keywords needed to return good results from the neighbors lookup. But it breaks down in a chat format when user prompt is missing implied context from earlier in the conversation.

For example, for simplicity let's say its a Wikipedia chat application (wikipedia embedded in a vector database)...

If user prompt is: ""Who was the 4th president of the United States?"" the lookup will work great, returning the correct content, and llm will be able to generate a great response sourcing the context from wikipedia.

Now if user continues chatting and next prompt is ""What about the 5th?"" the lookup will obviously fail, returning random content that is close to ""5th"" only, has nothing to do with the United States. Then llm, will hallucinate as its sourcing random Wikipedia content to generate a response.   


Is there a good method to modify user prompts, based on chat history, to provide full context to the vector lookup?  


I've tried a text completion step before the lookup. Something like ""Given the following chat history, edit the last user question to provide any information from the chat history that would be needed to make the last user question make sense out of context: \\n History: {chat-history} \\n Last Question: {last-question} \\n Edited Question:""  


However I am having difficulties finding a completion prompt that generates any quality results. Is there another approach to this issue? I feel like this must be a common problem in RAG systems that are not a single question/answer but actually maintain a chat.."

Like it created formulas that plainly threw errors. It used syntax which Excel doesn't accept and took over a dozen attempts to correct itself before it got stuck in a sort of -same wrong answer loop.

This all leads me to think:

Has someone trained an excel or Google sheets optimized LLM to take text prompts and successfully generate 9 times out of 10 correct Excel formulas?

Let's not worry about VBA for now... 

I turn to the hive-mind!"

I saw on this subreddit that many people have coded websites and apps, so perhaps I'm prompting incorrectly.
So what are the 'best practices' when prompting an LLM for code? Do you write out a detailed design/architecture doc and use that, or do you do it piecemeal? Would love some examples."

I’m a software engineer and have spent a lot of time “talking” to machines. But it seems some people struggle to understand what should be expected from a LLM.

This leads me to a thought that startups should focus exactly on that: having one magic button that says: “Do the goddamn job for me, I don’t even want to provide anything”."

We are continuously adding more features to it. 

You can also use extensions for discord or chatwoot.

It is also compatable with different llm providers such that you done have to rely on OpenAI

What are the ways to do the same with a folder structure of pdf files, text files etc. on your local file system (generally; not talking about using Obsidian here)? So I want to be able to ""talk"" to my collection of pdf's and text documents. I'm looking for existing, ready-to-use solutions, not to make one myself.

I would like to hear suggestions on any current solutions capable of doing this, both ones based on interrogating a web API and ones based on local/standalone/offline LLM's. No web applications though, I would like the solution to be available as a Linux desktop application."

**BERT** == Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers  
**GPT** == Generative Pre-trained Transformer

They both use the Transformer model, but BERT is relatively simpler because it only uses the encoder part of the Transformer.
