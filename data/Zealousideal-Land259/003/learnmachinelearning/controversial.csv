I know how to program with high level languages, C, and a bit of C++ and Scheme. I can build basic web apps and scripts, and am focusing on machine learning with python. 

With the release of ChatGPT and articles like [this](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2023/1/267976-the-end-of-programming/fulltext#comments) though, I can't help but ask — am I too late?

Is it simply too late for a beginner to make any contributions to the field at this point when OpenAI, Deepmind, and the like are iterating at such a rapid pace? I really love AI and machine learning so far, but I also don't want to waste my time and energy if there won't be any meaningful work for me once I finish my education in 4 or more years."
