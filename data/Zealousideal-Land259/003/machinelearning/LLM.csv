0,11ybjsi,machinelearning,LLM,top,2023-03-22 08:04:01,[D] Overwhelmed by fast advances in recent weeks,iamx9000again,False,0.96,827,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11ybjsi/d_overwhelmed_by_fast_advances_in_recent_weeks/,331,1679472241.0,"I was watching the GTC keynote and became entirely overwhelmed by the amount of progress achieved from last year.  I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

The command format  used in this example was designed to mimic the syntax of systems like autogpt. For context, autogpt and similar apps look for JSON commands which are then passed to methods to invoke server-side code.

The goal is to show that a user can bury malicious prompts inside of text. If the prompt is sufficiently convincing, GPT will do what it says instead of follow the original task. *An attack like this could be used to execute any command the bot is capable of.*

Consider the case of LLMs tasked to scrape internet data or read databases. Just one malicious prompt could corrupt the entire process. Since the bot understands natural language, almost any user could attempt an attack like this."

I found the reasoning to be very sound and promising for the OSS and AI community.

The  biggest risk from AI, in my opinion, is not the doomsday scenarios that  intuitively come to mind but rather that the most powerful AI systems  will only be accessible to the most powerful and resourceful  corporations.

Quote copied from Ben Thompson's write up on Meta's earning in his [Stratechery blog post](https://stratechery.com/2023/facebook-earnings-generative-ai-and-messaging-monetization-open-source-and-ai/) which goes beyond AI. *It's behind a paywall but I highly recommend it personally.*

Some noteworthy quotes that signal the thought process at Meta FAIR and more broadly

* We’re just playing a different game on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon
* We would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that.
* ...lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools
* Open sourcing low level tools make the way we run all this infrastructure more efficient over time.
* On  PyTorch: It’s generally been very valuable for us to provide that  because now  all of the best developers across the industry are using  tools that  we’re also using internally.
* I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem.

For  all the negative that comes out of the popular discourse on Meta, I  think their work to open source key tech tools over the last 10 years  has been exceptional, here's hoping it continues into this decade of AI  and pushes other tech giants to also realize the benefits of Open  Source.

Full Transcript:

>Right  now most of the companies that are training large language  models have  business models that lead them to a closed approach to development. I  think **there’s an** **important opportunity to help create an  open ecosystem.**  If we can help be a part of this, then much of the  industry will  standardize on using these open tools and help improve  them further. So  this will make it easier for other companies to  integrate with our  products and platforms as we enable more  integrations, and that will  help our products stay at the leading edge  as well.  
Our  approach to AI and our infrastructure has always been fairly  open. We  open source many of our state of the art models so people can   experiment and build with them. This quarter we released our LLaMa LLM   to researchers. It has 65 billion parameters but outperforms larger   models and has proven quite popular. We’ve also open-sourced three other   groundbreaking visual models along with their training data and model   weights — Segment Anything, DinoV2, and our Animated Drawings tool —  and  we’ve gotten positive feedback on all of those as well.  
I  think that there’s an important distinction between the products we  offer and a lot of the technical infrastructure, especially the software  that we write to support that. And historically, whether it’s the Open  Compute project that we’ve done or just open sourcing a lot of the   infrastructure that we’ve built, we’ve historically open sourced a lot   of that infrastructure, even though we haven’t open sourced the code for   our core products or anything like that.  
And the reason why I think why we do this is that unlike some of  the other companies in the space, **we’re not selling a cloud computing service** **where we try to keep the different software infrastructure that we’re building proprietary.** For us, **it’s way better if the industry  standardizes on the basic tools that we’re using**  and therefore we can benefit from the improvements that others make and  others’ use of those tools can, in some cases like Open Compute, **drive down the costs** of  those things which make our business more efficient too. So I think to  some degree **we’re just playing a different game** on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon, and that creates different incentives for us.  
So overall, I think **that that’s going to lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools**.  But of  course, a lot of the product work itself is going to be  specific and  integrated with the things that we do. So it’s not that  everything we do is going to be open. Obviously, a bunch of this needs  to be developed in a way that creates unique value for our products, but  I think in  terms of the basic models, **I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem** here, which I think is something that’s  going to be important.  
On the AI tools, and we have a bunch of history here, right? So if you  if you look at what we’ve done with **PyTorch**,  for example, which has  generally become the standard in the industry  as a tool that a lot of  folks who are building AI models and different  things in that space use,  **it’s generally been very valuable** for us to provide that because now  all of the **best developers across the industry are using tools that  we’re also using internally**.  So the tool chain is the same. So when they create some innovation, we  can easily integrate it into the things that we’re doing. When we  improve something, it improves other products too. Because it’s  integrated with our technology stack, when there are opportunities to  make integrations with products, it’s much easier to  make sure that  developers and other folks are compatible with the things  that we need  in the way that our systems work.  
So there are a lot of advantages, but **I view this more as a kind of back end infrastructure advantage with potential integrations on the  product side**,  but one that should hopefully enable us to stay at the  leading edge  and integrate more broadly with the community and also make  the way we  run all this infrastructure more efficient over time. There  are a  number of models. I just gave PyTorch as an example. Open Compute  is  another model that has worked really well for us in this way, both to   incorporate both innovation and scale efficiency into our own   infrastructure.  
So I think that  there’s, our incentives I think are basically  aligned towards moving in  this direction. Now that said, there’s a lot  to figure out, right? So  when you asked if there are going to be other opportunities, I hope so. I  can’t speak to what all those things might  be now. This is all quite  early in getting developed. **The better we do at the foundational work, the more opportunities** I think that will come and present themselves. So I think that that’s all stuff that we need to  figure out. But at least **at the base level, I think we’re generally incentivized to move in this direction**. And we also need to figure out  how to go in that direction over time.  
I  mean, I mentioned LLaMA before and I also want to be clear that  while  I’m talking about helping contribute to an open ecosystem, LLaMA  is a  model that we only really made available to researchers and there’s  a  lot of really good stuff that’s happening there. But a lot of the  work  that we’re doing, I think, **we would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that.**"

[video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

* Depth Maps
* Heat maps
* Text
* IMU (Camera Motion)

The model learned a *single shared representation* across all modalities, allowing it to transfer from any one to any other one. This gives it some novel abilities like generating or retrieving images based on sound clips, or identifying objects that might make a given sound. It also outperforms specialist models trained on supervised data on a variety of zero-shot tasks.

These are my discoveries after ~100 hours of extensive experimentation and ways I think it can be improved.,NepNep_,False,0.9,309,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12pqqg6/discussion_translation_of_japanese_to_english/,62,1681754083.0,"Hello. I am currently experimenting with the viability of LLM models for Japanese to English translation. I've been experimenting with GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 utilizing the DAN protocols, and GPT 4 for this project for around 3 months now with very promising results and I think I've identified several limitations with GPT that if addressed can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of translations.

&#x200B;

The project I'm working on is attempting to translate a light novel series from japanese to english. During these tests I did a deep dive, asking GPT how it is attempting the translations and asking it to modify its translation methodology through various means (I am considering doing a long video outlining all this and showing off the prompts and responses at a later date). Notably this includes asking it to utilize its understanding of the series its translating from its training knowledge to aide in the translation, and providing it with a ""seed"" translation. Basically the seed is a side by side japanese and english translation to show GPT what I'm looking for in terms of grammar and formatting. The english translation notably is a human translation, not a machine translation. The results from these tests provided SIGNIFICANT improvements to the final translation, so significant in fact that a large portion of the text could reasonably be assumed to be human-translated.

&#x200B;

Link to the project I'm working on so you can see my documentation and results: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT\_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

I've probably done around 50-100 hours of extensive testing with translation and methodology over the past 2-3 months. Over that time I've discovered the following:

1. Both GPT3 and GPT4 are significant improvements over traditional translation services such as google or deepl. This may be because Japanese and English are very different languages in how they are written and how their grammar works so prior translation services simply did a direct translation while GPT is capable of understanding the text and rewriting it to account for that. For example in japanese, there are no pronouns like ""he"" and ""her"" so a person's gender might not be clear from the sentence alone. Google Translate and DeepL typically just take a 50/50 guess, while GPT from my experience has been much more capable in getting this right based on understanding the larger context from the paragraph.
2. GPT has a tendency to censor text deliberately if it feels the translation may offend people. This isn't just for things that are blatantly offensive like slurs, it also includes mild sexual content, the kind that is typically approved for teen viewing/reading. The biggest problem is that it doesn't tell you it is censoring anything unless you ask it, meaning everything else may be a solid translation yet it may censor information which can ultimately hurt the translation, especially for story related translations like in my tests. These restrictions can be bypassed with correct prompting. I've had luck using GPT 3's DAN protocols however DAN's translations arent as strong as GPT 4, and I've had luck with GPT 4 by framing the translation as a game with extreme win and loss conditions and telling it that if it censors the translation, it may offend the author of the content since people in japan hold different values from our own.
3. GPT puts too high a focus on accuracy even if instructed not to. This is a good thing to a degree since outside of censorship you know the translation is accurate, however even when explicitly told to put maximum emphasis on readability, even if it hurts the accuracy, and it is allowed to rewrite sentences from the ground up to aide readability, it still puts too strong an emphasis on accuracy. I have determined this through testing that for some reason it is ignoring the request to focus on readability and will still maximize accuracy. The best way I've found to fix this issue is through demonstration, specifically the ""seed"" I mentioned earlier. By giving it a japanese and english translation of the same work but earlier in the story, it then understands how to put more emphasis on readability. The results is something that is 95% within the range of accuracy a professional translator would use while much easier to read.
4. GPT's biggest limitation is the fact that it ""forgets"" the seed way too quickly, usually within a few prompts. I've done testing with its data retention and it appears that if you give it too much information to remember at once it slowly bugs out. With GPT 3 its a hard crash type bug where it just spews nonsense unrelated to your request, however GPT 4 can remember a lot more information and will hard crash if you give it too much info but otherwise builds up errors slowly as you give it more info. I initially believed that there were issues with the token count, but further testing shows that the GPT model simply isn't optimized for this method of translation and a new or reworked model that you can give a seed and it will remember it longer would be better. The seed is one of the best tools for improving its performance

Next steps:

I would like to try to either create my own model or modify an existing one to optimize it for translation. If any1 knows any tools or guides I'd appreciate it."

I recently read [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/i_lost_everything_that_made_me_love_my_job/) about a 2D modeler experiencing an existential crisis about their job being disrupted by midjourney ([HN discussion here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35319861)). I can't help but feel the same as someone who has been working in the applied ML space for the past few years. 

Despite my background in ""classical"" ML, I'm feeling some anxiety about the rapid pace of LLM development and face a fear of missing out / being left behind.

I'd love to get involved again in ML research apart from my day job, but one of the biggest obstacles is the fact that training most of foundational LLM research requires huge compute more than anything else \[1\]. I understand that there are some directions in distributing compute ([https://petals.ml](https://petals.ml/)), or distilling existing models  ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)). 

I thought I might not be the only one being humbled by the recent advances in ChatGPT, etc. and wanted to hear how other people feel / are getting involved.

\[1\] I can't help but be reminded of Sutton's description of the [""bitter lesson"" of modern AI research](https://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html): ""breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation... eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach."""

It's MIT licensed.

[Code at Github.](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster)

[Test it out.](https://bot.co/tokenmonster.html)

The general-english-65535 vocabulary, and the code versions are already complete. The general-english-32000 should be finished within a few hours. Then I'm going test a non-greedy version which should do even better.

**Intro from README:**

tokenmonster is a novel approach to tokenization with broad-ranging use potential, but its primary motivation is to increase the inference speed and context-length of large language models by choosing better tokens. By selecting more optimal tokens, text can be represented with 20-30% less tokens compared to other modern tokenizing methods, increasing the speed of inference, training and the length of text by 20-30%. The code-optimized tokenizers do even better, [see it for yourself](https://bot.co/tokenmonster.html).

I also believe that tokenmonster vocabularies will improve the comprehension of Large Language Models. For more details see [How and Why](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster#how-and-why).

## Features

* Longer text generation at faster speed
* Determines the optimal token combination for a greedy tokenizer (non-greedy support coming)
* Successfully identifies common phrases and figures of speech
* Works with all languages and formats, even binary
* Quickly skims over HTML tags, sequential spaces, tabs, etc. without wasting context
* Does not require normalization or preprocessing of text
* Averages > 5 tokens per character
* No GPU needed

Edit: There is some misunderstanding about my ""performance"" claim, that claim is speed performance, not quality performance. By optimally tokenizing this increases the speed of inference and training (because there are less tokens to train and infer on), and it increases the total amount of text that can be output within the context-length (because the tokens decode to more text). It will probably make zero difference to LLM quality, however you could run a better model within the same time, so all these things are related."

It outputs the following values:

0.013, 0.078, 0.266, 0.040, 0.117, 0.283, 0.048, 0.078, 0.181, 0.134, 0.017, 0.160, 0.052, 0.196, 0.096, 0.098, 0.019, 0.048, 0.141, 0.071, 0.106, 0.023, 0.197, 0.062, 0.029, 0.072, 0.111, 0.166, 0.080, 0.027, 0.124, 0.016, 0.135, 0.052, 0.078, 0.161, 0.078, 0.139, 0.068, 0.066, 0.039, 0.056, 0.018, 0.082, 0.180, 0.086, 0.024, 0.022, 0.057, 0.042, 0.050, 0.104, 0.099, 0.062, 0.016, 0.186, 0.043, 0.085, 0.145, 0.110.

I get to plot a histogram with the numbers and they are close to what I would consider an exponential distribution with such parameter (you can see the plot).

Given that GPT 3.5 does not have access to a Python interpreter, how on earth is it able to do so? I have also tried other distributions and parameters and it kind of works. It's not perfect, but with normal distributions it is usually close to what scipy.stats would generate.

I could understand that it can have learnt to interpret Python code to some extent, but honestly I can't find explanation for random sampling from a probability distribution. For a Normal distribution, I can tell it about the desired mean and variance, and it samples values that are more than reasonable (and close to the true mean/variance specified).

Any thoughts? I honestly am unable to wrap my head around how a LLM can have the understanding on how to sample tokens (at digit level) to fit any probability distribution. To me it seems very unlikely to have similar data either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages."

Abstract:

>Recent advancements in decision-making large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive performance across various benchmarks. However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing these methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess certain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, **specifically the ability to learn from mistakes**. **Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve novel problems through a process of trial and error.** Building on recent research, we propose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with **dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities.** To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective heuristic that **enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances, avoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment.** To assess our approach, we evaluate the agent's ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments and knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA environments. We observe success rates of 97% and 51%, respectively, and provide a discussion on the emergent property of self-reflection.

We've extended Postgres w/ open source models from Huggingface, as well as vector search, and classical ML algos, so that everything can happen in the same process. It's significantly faster and cheaper, which leaves a large latency budget available to expand model and algorithm complexity.

Here is a series of posts explaining how to accomplish the complexity involved in a typical ML powered application, as a single SQL query, that runs in a single process with memory shared between models and feature indexes, including learned embeddings and reranking models.

* [Personalize embedding results with application data](https://postgresml.org/blog/personalize-embedding-vector-search-results-with-huggingface-and-pgvector)

This allows a single SQL query to accomplish what would normally be an entire application w/ several model services and databases

 e.g. for a modern chatbot built across various services and databases

1. application sends user input data to embedding service
   1. embedding model generates a vector to send back to application
2. application sends vector to vector database
   1. vector database returns associated metadata found via ANN
3. application sends metadata for reranking
   1. reranking model prunes less helpful context
4. application sends finished prompt w/ context to generative model
   1. model produces final output
5. application streams response to user

## What

### Godot 

The Godot Engine is a free, all-in-one, cross-platform game engine that makes it easy for you to create 2D and 3D games.

### RWKV

RWKV is an RNN with Transformer-level LLM performance, which can also be directly trained like a GPT transformer (parallelizable). And it's 100% attention-free. You only need the hidden state at position t to compute the state at position t+1.

### RWKV-CPP-CUDA

RWKV-CPP-CUDA is a c++/cuda library I created that implements the RWKV inference code in pure cuda. This allows for compiled code with no torch or python dependencies, while allowing the full use of GPU acceleration.
The code implements 8bit inference, allowing for quick and light inference.

### Godot+RWKV

Godot+RWKV is a Godot module that I developed using RWKV-CPP-CUDA, and allows the development of games and programs using RWKV to be developed and distributed using godot, without the need to install complex environments and libraries, for both developers and consumers.

## Why

* I felt I could achieve it
* Its something thats needed to advance the use of AI in consumer devices
* The lols
* Attention, because I didnt get much growing up, and RWKV has none
* ADHD hyperfocus

These are RWKV BF16 numbers. RWKV 3B is better than GPT-neo 2.7B on everything (smaller RWKV lags behind on LAMBADA). Note GPT-J is using rotary and thus quite better than GPT-neo, so I expect RWKV to surpass it when both are at 14B.

RWKV has both RNN & GPT mode. The RNN mode is great for inference. The GPT mode is great for training. Both modes are faster than usual transformer and saves VRAM, because the self-attention mechanism is replaced by simpler (almost linear) formulas. Moreover the hidden state is tiny in the RNN mode and you can use it as an embedding of the whole context.

Do you fear that some of these gigantic models will ""swallow"" your research, simply by someone combining those fields / overlaying the field over LLMs?

Is there any trouble with finding grants / funding, if you're not all hands on deck with the latest trends?

Has the timeline of you research stayed the same, or has the latest boom forced you to work faster?

I wanted to share with you [SimpleAI](https://github.com/lhenault/simpleAI), a self-hosted alternative to OpenAI API.

The aim of this project is to replicate the (main) endpoints of [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), and to let you easily and quickly plug in any new model. It basically allows you to deploy your custom model wherever you want and easily, while minimizing the amount of changes both on server and client sides.

It's compatible with the [OpenAI client](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) so you don't have to change much in your existing code (or can use it to easily query your API).

Wether you like or not the AI-as-a-service approach of OpenAI, I think that project could be of interest to many. Even if you are fully satisfied with a paid API, you might be interested in this if:

* You need a model fine tuned on some specific language and don't see any good alternative, or your company data is too sensitive to send it to an external service

* You’ve developped your own awesome model, and want a drop-in replacement to switch to yours, to be able to A/B test the two approaches.

* You're deploying your services in an infrastructure with an unreliable internet connection, so you would rather have your service locally

* You're just another AI enthusiast with a lot of spare time and free GPU

I've personally really enjoyed how open the ML(Ops) community has been in the past years, and seeing how the industry seems to be moving towards paid API and black box systems can be a bit worrying. This project might be useful to expose great, community-based alternatives.


If that sounds interesting, please have a look at the [examples](https://github.com/lhenault/simpleAI/tree/main/examples). I also have a [blogpost](https://louishenault.com/p/replicating-openai-api-for-llama-alpaca-or-any-animal-shaped-llm/) explaining a few more things.


Thank you!"

Throughout history, humans have dreamed of robots that could assist them with their daily lives and work. With the emergence of home assistants and OpenAI's Copilot, requests such as 'Please lower the temperature of the air conditioning' or even 'Please help me build an online store' have become possible.The emergence of GPT-4 has further demonstrated the potential of multimodal large models in visual understanding. In the open-source small model space, LLAVA and minigpt-4 have performed well in image recognition and chat, and can even suggest recipes for food images. However, these models still face significant challenges in practical implementation: they lack accurate localization capabilities and cannot provide specific locations of objects in images, nor can they understand complex human instructions to detect specific objects, making it difficult for them to perform specific tasks as requested by humans. In practical scenarios, if people could simply take a photo and ask an intelligent assistant for the correct answer to a complex problem, such a 'take a photo and ask' feature would be incredibly cool.  
To implement the ""**take a photo and ask**"" feature, robots need to have several capabilities:

1. Language understanding: the ability to listen and understand human intentions.
2. Visual understanding: the ability to understand the objects in the image.
3. Common sense reasoning: the ability to convert complex human intentions into precise and locatable targets.
4. Object localization: the ability to locate and detect corresponding objects in the image.

Currently, only a few large models (such as Google's PaLM-E) possess all four of these capabilities. However, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have proposed an open-source model called DetGPT (DetectionGPT), which only needs to fine-tune three million parameters to easily acquire complex reasoning and local object localization capabilities that can be generalized to most scenarios. This means that the model can easily recognize the objects that humans are interested in through self-knowledge reasoning and understand abstract human instructions. They have already developed a ""take a photo and ask"" demo using the model, which can be experienced online: [https://detgpt.github.io/](https://detgpt.github.io/)DetGPT allows users to operate everything with natural language without the need for complex commands or interfaces. In addition, DetGPT has intelligent reasoning and object detection capabilities, which can accurately understand user needs and intentions. For example, if a human gives a language instruction, ""I want to have a cold beverage,"" the robot first searches for a cold drink in the scene but does not find any. It then begins to think, ""There is no visible beverage. Where can I find it?"" Through its powerful common sense reasoning ability, the model realizes that the fridge is a possible location and scans the scene to successfully locate the drink!

## Features of DetGPT

DetGPT has several unique features:

1. It has a significantly improved understanding of specific objects in images. Compared to previous models that use multimodal dialogues, DetGPT can retrieve and locate target objects from images based on the user's instructions, rather than simply describing the entire image.
2. It can understand complex human instructions, which lowers the barrier for users to ask questions. For example, the model can understand the question ""find fruits that can relieve hypertension?"" Traditional object detection requires humans to know the answer and pre-set the detection category, such as ""banana.""
3. DetGPT can use existing LLM knowledge to reason and accurately locate the corresponding object in the image that can solve more complex tasks. For complex tasks, such as ""fruits that can relieve hypertension,"" DetGPT can reason step by step: relieving hypertension -> potassium can relieve hypertension -> bananas are rich in potassium -> bananas can relieve hypertension -> need to identify the object banana.
4. It provides answers beyond human common sense. For some uncommon questions, such as which fruits are rich in potassium, the model can provide answers based on existing knowledge.

## A new direction: reasoning-based object detection

Traditional object detection tasks require pre-defined categories of possible objects for detection. However, providing accurate and comprehensive descriptions of the objects to be detected can be difficult and unrealistic for humans. This is due to the limitations of human memory and knowledge. For instance, a doctor may recommend that people with hypertension eat fruits rich in potassium, but may not know which specific fruits are rich in potassium, making it impossible to provide specific fruit names for the model to detect. If the question ""Identify fruits that can help alleviate hypertension"" could be directly posed to the detection model, humans would only need to take a photo, and the model could think, reason, and detect fruits rich in potassium, making the problem much simpler.Moreover, the examples of object categories provided by humans are not always comprehensive. For instance, if monitoring is required to detect behaviors that violate public order relative to public places, humans may only be able to provide a few simple scenarios, such as holding a knife or smoking. However, if the question ""detect behaviors that violate public order"" is directly posed to the detection model, the model can think and reason based on its own knowledge, thus capturing more unacceptable behaviors and generalizing to more relevant categories that need to be detected. After all, the knowledge that ordinary humans have access to is limited, and the object categories that they can provide examples of are also limited. However, if there is a big brain-like ChatGPT-like model to assist and reason, the instructions that humans need to provide will be much simpler, and the obtained answers will be much more accurate and comprehensive.To address the limitations of human instructions and their abstract nature, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have proposed a new direction called ""reasoning-based object detection."" In simple terms, humans give complex tasks, and the model can understand and reason about which objects in the image might be able to complete the task, and then detect them. For example, if a person describes ""I want to drink a cold drink, where can I find it,"" and the model sees a picture of a kitchen, it can detect the ""refrigerator."" This topic requires the perfect combination of multimodal models' image understanding ability and the rich knowledge stored in language models. It is used in fine-grained detection scenarios to accurately locate objects of interest to humans in images without pre-defined object categories.  


# The Approach

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ho9ux1pcahza1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf42e1baffa2925e8b946b191766ca116aec2fe1

The ""reasoning-based object detection"" is a challenging problem because the detector needs to understand and reason about the user's coarse-grained/abstract instructions and analyze the current visual information to locate the target object accurately. In this direction, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have conducted some preliminary explorations. Specifically, they use a pre-trained visual encoder (BLIP-2) to extract visual features from images and align the visual features to the text space using an alignment function. They use a large-scale language model (Robin/Vicuna) to understand the user's question, combined with the visual information they see, to reason about the objects that users are truly interested in. Then, they provide the object names to the pre-trained detector (Grounding-DINO) for specific location prediction. In this way, the model can analyze the image based on any user instructions and accurately predict the location of the object of interest to the user.  
It is worth noting that the difficulty here mainly lies in the fact that the model needs to achieve task-specific output formats for different specific tasks as much as possible without damaging the model's original abilities. To guide the language model to follow specific patterns and generate outputs that conform to the object detection format, the research team used ChatGPT to generate cross-modal instruction data to fine-tune the model. Specifically, based on 5000 coco images, they used ChatGPT to create a 30,000 cross-modal image-text fine-tuning dataset. To improve the efficiency of training, they fixed other model parameters and only learned cross-modal linear mapping. Experimental results show that even if only the linear layer is fine-tuned, the language model can understand fine-grained image features and follow specific patterns to perform inference-based image detection tasks, showing excellent performance.  
This research topic has great potential. Based on this technology, the field of home robots will further shine: people in homes can use abstract or coarse-grained voice instructions to make robots understand, recognize, and locate the objects they need, and provide relevant services. In the field of industrial robots, this technology will bring endless vitality: industrial robots can cooperate more naturally with human workers, accurately understand their instructions and needs, and achieve intelligent decision-making and operations. On the production line, human workers can use coarse-grained voice instructions or text input to allow robots to automatically understand, recognize, and locate the items that need to be processed, thereby improving production efficiency and quality.  
With object detection models that come with reasoning capabilities, we can develop more intelligent, natural, and efficient robots to provide more convenient, efficient, and humane services to humans. This is a field with broad prospects and deserves more attention and further exploration by more researchers.  
DetGPT supports multiple language models and has been validated based on two language models, Robin-13B and Vicuna-13B. The Robin series language model is a dialogue model trained by the LMFlow team ( https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, achieving results competitive to Vicuna on multiple language ability evaluation benchmarks (model download: [https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow#model-zoo](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow#model-zoo)). Previously, the LMFlow team trained a vertical GPT model using a consumer-grade 3090 graphics card in just 5 hours. Today, this team, in collaboration with the NLP Group at the University of Hong Kong, has brought us a multimodal surprise.

From my personal experience, the quality of the model depends a lot on the fine-tuning data as opposed to just the sheer size.

The future of LLMs might look more open-source than imagined 3 months back?

So this all started with me wanting to talk to my local Alpaca bot from the bar to show my friend something. He’s a mobile developer and also recently unemployed like me, so the stars aligned and we built this thing over the last few weeks. 

Friendly AI is an app that is compatible with the [BaseBot](https://github.com/sergeybok/BaseBot) python library that we built. We are basically open sourcing the message protocol that it uses so that you can build your own “backend” for it that does whatever you want! I recently built myself a bot that allows me to write and run commands, shell scripts, and even python from my phone. Very handy when you went to the bar and forgot to commit and push your code. 

[Apple app is available](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-ai/id6447589849). The android app is currently in review so hopefully comes out later today.

If you are using Mac/Ubuntu the Quickstart command from the GitHub Readme should set you up with a starter project. If you either already have openai key on your system, or you create one and provide it on install, it will start you off with a simple ChatGPT wrapper (like the one that comes with the app if you Sign Up). 

If you are on windows I’m sorry neither of us has one so we couldn’t create an install script. However if you pip install the library and read the Readme you should be fine. 

Furthermore because it’s self-hosted, you can be sure that your data stays private. It’s stored on your own machine (in mongodb if you have it setup, in json files if you don’t). When you message your bots from the app the message data is sent directly to your bot and nowhere else. 

I think here of all places people will make good use of this tech. Because personally since I don’t have millions of dollars and can’t be actually working on proper LLM research by myself (which is what I’d rather be doing tbh), at least I can build cool stuff that uses the already existing models. 

The signup stuff isn’t necessary, the only reason why we built it is just to be able to limit people’s use of our bots, while also providing some access to them since without any bots you can’t try out the app. But we want people to build their own bots, and not simply use ours!

My hope was that it would remove a lot of the annoying parts of building bots and let people (including myself) concentrate on the actual interesting / ML /etc. parts of the problem — namely what the bot actually does in response to user prompts! And of course, the response doesn't actually have to use any LLMs (e.g. you can hook up your local stable diffusion model), or ML in general (as I said earlier I made a bot that simply executes the shell commands i give it). 

PS. Our servers are basically free-tier so in the off-chance that there’s a lot of downloads they might not hold up. But even if our servers are completely down that affects only our bots, you can still talk with your own bots!"

GPT 3.5 provided the best answers, but FastChat-T5 was very close in performance (with a basic guardrail). The T5 models I tested are all licensed under Apache 2.0, so they are commercially viable.

For the embedding model, I compared OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 and the open source INSTRUCTOR-XL models. The INSTRUCTOR-XL model performed better, which is encouraging since INSTRUCTOR-XL is also licensed under Apache 2.0.

Abstract:

>Despite recent success in large language model (LLM) reasoning, **LLMs struggle with hierarchical multi-step reasoning tasks like generating complex programs.** For these tasks, **humans often start with a high-level algorithmic design and implement each part gradually.** We introduce Parsel, a framework enabling automatic implementation and validation of complex algorithms with code LLMs, taking hierarchical function descriptions in natural language as input. We show that **Parsel can be used across domains requiring hierarchical reasoning, including program synthesis, robotic planning, and theorem proving.** We show that LLMs generating Parsel solve more competition-level problems in the APPS dataset, resulting in **pass rates that are over 75% higher than prior results from directly sampling AlphaCode and Codex**, while often using a smaller sample budget. We also find that LLM-generated **robotic plans using Parsel as an intermediate language are more than twice as likely to be considered accurate than directly generated plans.** Lastly, we explore how Parsel addresses LLM limitations and discuss how Parsel may be useful for human programmers.

36,11ybjsi,machinelearning,LLM,comments,2023-03-22 08:04:01,[D] Overwhelmed by fast advances in recent weeks,iamx9000again,False,0.96,829,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11ybjsi/d_overwhelmed_by_fast_advances_in_recent_weeks/,331,1679472241.0,"I was watching the GTC keynote and became entirely overwhelmed by the amount of progress achieved from last year.  I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible.

I recently read [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/i_lost_everything_that_made_me_love_my_job/) about a 2D modeler experiencing an existential crisis about their job being disrupted by midjourney ([HN discussion here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35319861)). I can't help but feel the same as someone who has been working in the applied ML space for the past few years. 

Despite my background in ""classical"" ML, I'm feeling some anxiety about the rapid pace of LLM development and face a fear of missing out / being left behind.

I'd love to get involved again in ML research apart from my day job, but one of the biggest obstacles is the fact that training most of foundational LLM research requires huge compute more than anything else \[1\]. I understand that there are some directions in distributing compute ([https://petals.ml](https://petals.ml/)), or distilling existing models  ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)). 

I thought I might not be the only one being humbled by the recent advances in ChatGPT, etc. and wanted to hear how other people feel / are getting involved.

\[1\] I can't help but be reminded of Sutton's description of the [""bitter lesson"" of modern AI research](https://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html): ""breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation... eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach."""

The command format  used in this example was designed to mimic the syntax of systems like autogpt. For context, autogpt and similar apps look for JSON commands which are then passed to methods to invoke server-side code.

The goal is to show that a user can bury malicious prompts inside of text. If the prompt is sufficiently convincing, GPT will do what it says instead of follow the original task. *An attack like this could be used to execute any command the bot is capable of.*

Consider the case of LLMs tasked to scrape internet data or read databases. Just one malicious prompt could corrupt the entire process. Since the bot understands natural language, almost any user could attempt an attack like this."

Here's the prompt I used on a fresh session:

It outputs the following values:

0.013, 0.078, 0.266, 0.040, 0.117, 0.283, 0.048, 0.078, 0.181, 0.134, 0.017, 0.160, 0.052, 0.196, 0.096, 0.098, 0.019, 0.048, 0.141, 0.071, 0.106, 0.023, 0.197, 0.062, 0.029, 0.072, 0.111, 0.166, 0.080, 0.027, 0.124, 0.016, 0.135, 0.052, 0.078, 0.161, 0.078, 0.139, 0.068, 0.066, 0.039, 0.056, 0.018, 0.082, 0.180, 0.086, 0.024, 0.022, 0.057, 0.042, 0.050, 0.104, 0.099, 0.062, 0.016, 0.186, 0.043, 0.085, 0.145, 0.110.

I get to plot a histogram with the numbers and they are close to what I would consider an exponential distribution with such parameter (you can see the plot).

Given that GPT 3.5 does not have access to a Python interpreter, how on earth is it able to do so? I have also tried other distributions and parameters and it kind of works. It's not perfect, but with normal distributions it is usually close to what scipy.stats would generate.

I could understand that it can have learnt to interpret Python code to some extent, but honestly I can't find explanation for random sampling from a probability distribution. For a Normal distribution, I can tell it about the desired mean and variance, and it samples values that are more than reasonable (and close to the true mean/variance specified).

Any thoughts? I honestly am unable to wrap my head around how a LLM can have the understanding on how to sample tokens (at digit level) to fit any probability distribution. To me it seems very unlikely to have similar data either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages."

[video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

It's MIT licensed.

[Code at Github.](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster)

The general-english-65535 vocabulary, and the code versions are already complete. The general-english-32000 should be finished within a few hours. Then I'm going test a non-greedy version which should do even better.

**Intro from README:**

tokenmonster is a novel approach to tokenization with broad-ranging use potential, but its primary motivation is to increase the inference speed and context-length of large language models by choosing better tokens. By selecting more optimal tokens, text can be represented with 20-30% less tokens compared to other modern tokenizing methods, increasing the speed of inference, training and the length of text by 20-30%. The code-optimized tokenizers do even better, [see it for yourself](https://bot.co/tokenmonster.html).

I also believe that tokenmonster vocabularies will improve the comprehension of Large Language Models. For more details see [How and Why](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster#how-and-why).

## Features

* Longer text generation at faster speed
* Determines the optimal token combination for a greedy tokenizer (non-greedy support coming)
* Successfully identifies common phrases and figures of speech
* Works with all languages and formats, even binary
* Quickly skims over HTML tags, sequential spaces, tabs, etc. without wasting context
* Does not require normalization or preprocessing of text
* Averages > 5 tokens per character
* No GPU needed

Edit: There is some misunderstanding about my ""performance"" claim, that claim is speed performance, not quality performance. By optimally tokenizing this increases the speed of inference and training (because there are less tokens to train and infer on), and it increases the total amount of text that can be output within the context-length (because the tokens decode to more text). It will probably make zero difference to LLM quality, however you could run a better model within the same time, so all these things are related."

Abstract:

>Recent advancements in decision-making large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive performance across various benchmarks. However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing these methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess certain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, **specifically the ability to learn from mistakes**. **Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve novel problems through a process of trial and error.** Building on recent research, we propose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with **dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities.** To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective heuristic that **enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances, avoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment.** To assess our approach, we evaluate the agent's ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments and knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA environments. We observe success rates of 97% and 51%, respectively, and provide a discussion on the emergent property of self-reflection.

I found the reasoning to be very sound and promising for the OSS and AI community.

The  biggest risk from AI, in my opinion, is not the doomsday scenarios that  intuitively come to mind but rather that the most powerful AI systems  will only be accessible to the most powerful and resourceful  corporations.

Quote copied from Ben Thompson's write up on Meta's earning in his [Stratechery blog post](https://stratechery.com/2023/facebook-earnings-generative-ai-and-messaging-monetization-open-source-and-ai/) which goes beyond AI. *It's behind a paywall but I highly recommend it personally.*

Some noteworthy quotes that signal the thought process at Meta FAIR and more broadly

* We’re just playing a different game on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon
* We would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that.
* ...lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools
* Open sourcing low level tools make the way we run all this infrastructure more efficient over time.
* On  PyTorch: It’s generally been very valuable for us to provide that  because now  all of the best developers across the industry are using  tools that  we’re also using internally.
* I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem.

For  all the negative that comes out of the popular discourse on Meta, I  think their work to open source key tech tools over the last 10 years  has been exceptional, here's hoping it continues into this decade of AI  and pushes other tech giants to also realize the benefits of Open  Source.

>Right  now most of the companies that are training large language  models have  business models that lead them to a closed approach to development. I  think **there’s an** **important opportunity to help create an  open ecosystem.**  If we can help be a part of this, then much of the  industry will  standardize on using these open tools and help improve  them further. So  this will make it easier for other companies to  integrate with our  products and platforms as we enable more  integrations, and that will  help our products stay at the leading edge  as well.  
Our  approach to AI and our infrastructure has always been fairly  open. We  open source many of our state of the art models so people can   experiment and build with them. This quarter we released our LLaMa LLM   to researchers. It has 65 billion parameters but outperforms larger   models and has proven quite popular. We’ve also open-sourced three other   groundbreaking visual models along with their training data and model   weights — Segment Anything, DinoV2, and our Animated Drawings tool —  and  we’ve gotten positive feedback on all of those as well.  
I  think that there’s an important distinction between the products we  offer and a lot of the technical infrastructure, especially the software  that we write to support that. And historically, whether it’s the Open  Compute project that we’ve done or just open sourcing a lot of the   infrastructure that we’ve built, we’ve historically open sourced a lot   of that infrastructure, even though we haven’t open sourced the code for   our core products or anything like that.  
And the reason why I think why we do this is that unlike some of  the other companies in the space, **we’re not selling a cloud computing service** **where we try to keep the different software infrastructure that we’re building proprietary.** For us, **it’s way better if the industry  standardizes on the basic tools that we’re using**  and therefore we can benefit from the improvements that others make and  others’ use of those tools can, in some cases like Open Compute, **drive down the costs** of  those things which make our business more efficient too. So I think to  some degree **we’re just playing a different game** on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon, and that creates different incentives for us.  
So overall, I think **that that’s going to lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools**.  But of  course, a lot of the product work itself is going to be  specific and  integrated with the things that we do. So it’s not that  everything we do is going to be open. Obviously, a bunch of this needs  to be developed in a way that creates unique value for our products, but  I think in  terms of the basic models, **I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem** here, which I think is something that’s  going to be important.  
On the AI tools, and we have a bunch of history here, right? So if you  if you look at what we’ve done with **PyTorch**,  for example, which has  generally become the standard in the industry  as a tool that a lot of  folks who are building AI models and different  things in that space use,  **it’s generally been very valuable** for us to provide that because now  all of the **best developers across the industry are using tools that  we’re also using internally**.  So the tool chain is the same. So when they create some innovation, we  can easily integrate it into the things that we’re doing. When we  improve something, it improves other products too. Because it’s  integrated with our technology stack, when there are opportunities to  make integrations with products, it’s much easier to  make sure that  developers and other folks are compatible with the things  that we need  in the way that our systems work.  
So there are a lot of advantages, but **I view this more as a kind of back end infrastructure advantage with potential integrations on the  product side**,  but one that should hopefully enable us to stay at the  leading edge  and integrate more broadly with the community and also make  the way we  run all this infrastructure more efficient over time. There  are a  number of models. I just gave PyTorch as an example. Open Compute  is  another model that has worked really well for us in this way, both to   incorporate both innovation and scale efficiency into our own   infrastructure.  
So I think that  there’s, our incentives I think are basically  aligned towards moving in  this direction. Now that said, there’s a lot  to figure out, right? So  when you asked if there are going to be other opportunities, I hope so. I  can’t speak to what all those things might  be now. This is all quite  early in getting developed. **The better we do at the foundational work, the more opportunities** I think that will come and present themselves. So I think that that’s all stuff that we need to  figure out. But at least **at the base level, I think we’re generally incentivized to move in this direction**. And we also need to figure out  how to go in that direction over time.  
I  mean, I mentioned LLaMA before and I also want to be clear that  while  I’m talking about helping contribute to an open ecosystem, LLaMA  is a  model that we only really made available to researchers and there’s  a  lot of really good stuff that’s happening there. But a lot of the  work  that we’re doing, I think, **we would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that.**"

Abstract:

>Thanks to rapid progress in artificial intelligence, we have entered an era when technology and philosophy intersect in interesting ways. Sitting squarely at the centre of this intersection are large language models (LLMs). **The more adept LLMs become at mimicking human language, the more vulnerable we become to anthropomorphism, to seeing the systems in which they are embedded as more human-like than they really are.**This trend is amplified by the natural tendency to use philosophically loaded terms, such as ""knows"", ""believes"", and ""thinks"", when describing these systems. To mitigate this trend, this paper advocates the practice of repeatedly stepping back to **remind ourselves of how LLMs, and the systems of which they form a part, actually work.** The hope is that increased scientific precision will encourage more philosophical nuance in the discourse around artificial intelligence, both within the field and in the public sphere.

These are my discoveries after ~100 hours of extensive experimentation and ways I think it can be improved.,NepNep_,False,0.9,312,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12pqqg6/discussion_translation_of_japanese_to_english/,62,1681754083.0,"Hello. I am currently experimenting with the viability of LLM models for Japanese to English translation. I've been experimenting with GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 utilizing the DAN protocols, and GPT 4 for this project for around 3 months now with very promising results and I think I've identified several limitations with GPT that if addressed can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of translations.

&#x200B;

The project I'm working on is attempting to translate a light novel series from japanese to english. During these tests I did a deep dive, asking GPT how it is attempting the translations and asking it to modify its translation methodology through various means (I am considering doing a long video outlining all this and showing off the prompts and responses at a later date). Notably this includes asking it to utilize its understanding of the series its translating from its training knowledge to aide in the translation, and providing it with a ""seed"" translation. Basically the seed is a side by side japanese and english translation to show GPT what I'm looking for in terms of grammar and formatting. The english translation notably is a human translation, not a machine translation. The results from these tests provided SIGNIFICANT improvements to the final translation, so significant in fact that a large portion of the text could reasonably be assumed to be human-translated.

&#x200B;

Link to the project I'm working on so you can see my documentation and results: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT\_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

I've probably done around 50-100 hours of extensive testing with translation and methodology over the past 2-3 months. Over that time I've discovered the following:

1. Both GPT3 and GPT4 are significant improvements over traditional translation services such as google or deepl. This may be because Japanese and English are very different languages in how they are written and how their grammar works so prior translation services simply did a direct translation while GPT is capable of understanding the text and rewriting it to account for that. For example in japanese, there are no pronouns like ""he"" and ""her"" so a person's gender might not be clear from the sentence alone. Google Translate and DeepL typically just take a 50/50 guess, while GPT from my experience has been much more capable in getting this right based on understanding the larger context from the paragraph.
2. GPT has a tendency to censor text deliberately if it feels the translation may offend people. This isn't just for things that are blatantly offensive like slurs, it also includes mild sexual content, the kind that is typically approved for teen viewing/reading. The biggest problem is that it doesn't tell you it is censoring anything unless you ask it, meaning everything else may be a solid translation yet it may censor information which can ultimately hurt the translation, especially for story related translations like in my tests. These restrictions can be bypassed with correct prompting. I've had luck using GPT 3's DAN protocols however DAN's translations arent as strong as GPT 4, and I've had luck with GPT 4 by framing the translation as a game with extreme win and loss conditions and telling it that if it censors the translation, it may offend the author of the content since people in japan hold different values from our own.
3. GPT puts too high a focus on accuracy even if instructed not to. This is a good thing to a degree since outside of censorship you know the translation is accurate, however even when explicitly told to put maximum emphasis on readability, even if it hurts the accuracy, and it is allowed to rewrite sentences from the ground up to aide readability, it still puts too strong an emphasis on accuracy. I have determined this through testing that for some reason it is ignoring the request to focus on readability and will still maximize accuracy. The best way I've found to fix this issue is through demonstration, specifically the ""seed"" I mentioned earlier. By giving it a japanese and english translation of the same work but earlier in the story, it then understands how to put more emphasis on readability. The results is something that is 95% within the range of accuracy a professional translator would use while much easier to read.
4. GPT's biggest limitation is the fact that it ""forgets"" the seed way too quickly, usually within a few prompts. I've done testing with its data retention and it appears that if you give it too much information to remember at once it slowly bugs out. With GPT 3 its a hard crash type bug where it just spews nonsense unrelated to your request, however GPT 4 can remember a lot more information and will hard crash if you give it too much info but otherwise builds up errors slowly as you give it more info. I initially believed that there were issues with the token count, but further testing shows that the GPT model simply isn't optimized for this method of translation and a new or reworked model that you can give a seed and it will remember it longer would be better. The seed is one of the best tools for improving its performance

Next steps:

I would like to try to either create my own model or modify an existing one to optimize it for translation. If any1 knows any tools or guides I'd appreciate it."

All of these methods have had various degrees of success, but it makes me wonder if they are attacking the problem in the right way. Ultimately for an LLM to truly have a useful long term memory, we wouldn't want it to just be able to increase its maximum dependency distance by 10 or 100 or 1000 times, but to improve it to be basically infinite. Consider that a human could remember data from decades in the past. Even if we expanded the LLMs context window to be millions of times longer, it might still not reach that.

However, if we look at most of the LLMs, they already have a method for achieving ""infinite"" memory. Their training on data has encoded tons of propositional facts into their neural networks, which include things like temporal data.  If a model is training while running, perhaps it will be able to memorize recent events. One downside I could see for this though is that it is way more expensive. This is somewhat aligned with biological brains, which are not just storing data via recurrence (although they do use recurrence), but are actively altering their neural structures while running. Part of inference is modifying weights."

Hey Redditors,

This is a project I've been wanting to do for a while. I've spoken to a lot of folks lately who are interested in using LLMs for their business but there's a ton of confusion around the licensing situation. It seems like the Llama platform has been getting all the love lately and I wanted to see what kind of performance I could get out of the Flan-UL2 model. It's underappreciated in my opinion given it has really strong performance on benchmarks (relative to other models in it's size category) and it supports up to 2048 input tokens which is on par with the Alpaca variants. Additionally, it's available under an Apache 2.0 license which means it's viable for commercial usage. 🔥

Despite being a strong model the base Flan-UL2 doesn't give great ""conversational"" responses, so I wanted to see what it was capable of using a newer dataset. I decided to try both Alpaca and Dolly15K. Alpaca is interesting given the massive improvement it had on Llama. It obviously has some licensing caveats which I discuss in the blog post. Dolly15K, which just came out last week, has none of the licensing ambiguity so I was very interested in seeing how those results compared to Alpaca finetuning.

All of the code I used for training is available in the Github links and the final LoRA models are on HuggingFace. I included benchmark results, comparisons and conclusions in the blog post.

Note that this is one of my first end-to-end finetuning experiments using an LLM so if you see I've made a mistake or have any feedback I'd love to hear it! ❤️

UPDATE: Correction to the hardware details used for training (from [vultr.com](https://vultr.com)). Note that during training the GPU was sitting around 49081MiB of utilization with batch\_size=1 and 8 bit precision. There was plenty of breathing room on that A100 :)

However they kinda suck at code generation: half of the times they spit out code which doesn't even compile, or that has obvious bugs.

I wonder whether anyone is working on a programming model, trained to program with itself and with a compiler. The idea on how to achieve this would seem simple:

1. Take a LLM trained on all the natural language data you have and as much decent code as you can.

2. Take as many problems as you can: all the coding problems out there, the problems users ask the model to implement, all the existing code on github which is self-contained and has got documentation for what it does.

3. For each problem, and for each programming language, run two instances of the LLM: one has the job to write a solution for the problem; the other one has to write unit-tests instead.

4. Compile the programs (or simply run them, for duck-typed languages): every time something fails, forward the error to the LLM and get it to generate new code. Keep doing this until everything succeeds.  
  If your dataset includes existing solutions (or existing unit tests) for a problem, us these ones too, to make sure that the code the network wrote is good.

5. Use these results to train/fine-tune the LLM and make it better at coding.

6. Run a similar algorithm when the LLM is asked to write some programs by the user (i.e. write both the code + the unit tests; iteratively fix issues until everything works).

Wouldn't something like this have high chances of outperforming current models, as well as a larger portion of software developers, in code generation?

Has anyone attempted to work on something similar?"

It's MIT licensed.

[Code at Github.](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster)

[Test it out.](https://bot.co/tokenmonster.html)

The general-english-65535 vocabulary, and the code versions are already complete. The general-english-32000 should be finished within a few hours. Then I'm going test a non-greedy version which should do even better.

**Intro from README:**

tokenmonster is a novel approach to tokenization with broad-ranging use potential, but its primary motivation is to increase the inference speed and context-length of large language models by choosing better tokens. By selecting more optimal tokens, text can be represented with 20-30% less tokens compared to other modern tokenizing methods, increasing the speed of inference, training and the length of text by 20-30%. The code-optimized tokenizers do even better, [see it for yourself](https://bot.co/tokenmonster.html).

I also believe that tokenmonster vocabularies will improve the comprehension of Large Language Models. For more details see [How and Why](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster#how-and-why).

## Features

* Longer text generation at faster speed
* Determines the optimal token combination for a greedy tokenizer (non-greedy support coming)
* Successfully identifies common phrases and figures of speech
* Works with all languages and formats, even binary
* Quickly skims over HTML tags, sequential spaces, tabs, etc. without wasting context
* Does not require normalization or preprocessing of text
* Averages > 5 tokens per character
* No GPU needed

Edit: There is some misunderstanding about my ""performance"" claim, that claim is speed performance, not quality performance. By optimally tokenizing this increases the speed of inference and training (because there are less tokens to train and infer on), and it increases the total amount of text that can be output within the context-length (because the tokens decode to more text). It will probably make zero difference to LLM quality, however you could run a better model within the same time, so all these things are related."

[video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

* Depth Maps
* Heat maps
* Text
* IMU (Camera Motion)

The model learned a *single shared representation* across all modalities, allowing it to transfer from any one to any other one. This gives it some novel abilities like generating or retrieving images based on sound clips, or identifying objects that might make a given sound. It also outperforms specialist models trained on supervised data on a variety of zero-shot tasks.
