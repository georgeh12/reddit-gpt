I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

In a new study, they rigorously tested the LLM's aptitude for generating differential diagnoses and aiding physicians.

They assessed the LLM on 302 real-world case reports from the New England Journal of Medicine. These case reports are known to be highly complex diagnostic challenges.

The LLM produced differential diagnosis lists that included the final confirmed diagnosis in the top 10 possibilities in 177 out of 302 cases, a top-10 accuracy of 59%. **This significantly exceeded the performance of experienced physicians, who had a top-10 accuracy of just 34% on the same cases when unassisted.**

According to assessments from senior specialists, the LLM's differential diagnoses were also rated to be **substantially more appropriate and comprehensive** than those produced by physicians, when evaluated across all 302 case reports.

This research demonstrates the potential for LLMs to enhance physicians' clinical reasoning abilities for complex cases. However, the authors emphasize that further rigorous real-world testing is essential before clinical deployment. Issues around model safety, fairness, and robustness must also be addressed.

It's great to have a way to break out of my own insular research bubble and spread out a bit more. Unfortunately, it looks like that era has passed.

The sub has been seemingly shifting away from research in the past 1-2 years. Whenever research is posted, it is almost always LLM based with very little variety (considering the plethora of research areas in ML). I don't mean to assert that this is a bad thing, as the constant upvotes indicate that there is a high demand for LLM projects and research. Heck, I'm also interested in lots of the recent work with LLMs, and I plan to keep up with it – but I also would also love a venue with a diversity of ideas and topics. Machine learning is a HUGE field, and only focusing on a small subset of it seems like a waste.

Are open-source LLMs gonna be the future? Considering the trust issues with ChatGPT and the debates about its safety, the idea of open-source LLMs seems to be the best bet imo.

Unlike closed-source models, users can verify the privacy claims of open-source models. There have been some good things being said about Mistral, and I only hope such open source LLMs secure enough funding to compete with giants like OpenAI. Maybe then, ChatGPT will also be forced to go open source?

With that said, I'm also hopeful that competitors like [Silatus](https://silatus.com/) and [Durable](https://durable.co/), which already use multiple models, consider using open-source models like Mistral into their frameworks. If that happens, maybe there might be a shift in AI privacy. What do you guys think? Are open-source LLMs the future, especially with the funding backing them?"

The command format  used in this example was designed to mimic the syntax of systems like autogpt. For context, autogpt and similar apps look for JSON commands which are then passed to methods to invoke server-side code.

The goal is to show that a user can bury malicious prompts inside of text. If the prompt is sufficiently convincing, GPT will do what it says instead of follow the original task. *An attack like this could be used to execute any command the bot is capable of.*

Consider the case of LLMs tasked to scrape internet data or read databases. Just one malicious prompt could corrupt the entire process. Since the bot understands natural language, almost any user could attempt an attack like this."

I found the reasoning to be very sound and promising for the OSS and AI community.

The  biggest risk from AI, in my opinion, is not the doomsday scenarios that  intuitively come to mind but rather that the most powerful AI systems  will only be accessible to the most powerful and resourceful  corporations.

Quote copied from Ben Thompson's write up on Meta's earning in his [Stratechery blog post](https://stratechery.com/2023/facebook-earnings-generative-ai-and-messaging-monetization-open-source-and-ai/) which goes beyond AI. *It's behind a paywall but I highly recommend it personally.*

Some noteworthy quotes that signal the thought process at Meta FAIR and more broadly

* We’re just playing a different game on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon
* We would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that.
* ...lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools
* Open sourcing low level tools make the way we run all this infrastructure more efficient over time.
* On  PyTorch: It’s generally been very valuable for us to provide that  because now  all of the best developers across the industry are using  tools that  we’re also using internally.
* I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem.

For  all the negative that comes out of the popular discourse on Meta, I  think their work to open source key tech tools over the last 10 years  has been exceptional, here's hoping it continues into this decade of AI  and pushes other tech giants to also realize the benefits of Open  Source.

Full Transcript:

>Right  now most of the companies that are training large language  models have  business models that lead them to a closed approach to development. I  think **there’s an** **important opportunity to help create an  open ecosystem.**  If we can help be a part of this, then much of the  industry will  standardize on using these open tools and help improve  them further. So  this will make it easier for other companies to  integrate with our  products and platforms as we enable more  integrations, and that will  help our products stay at the leading edge  as well.  
Our  approach to AI and our infrastructure has always been fairly  open. We  open source many of our state of the art models so people can   experiment and build with them. This quarter we released our LLaMa LLM   to researchers. It has 65 billion parameters but outperforms larger   models and has proven quite popular. We’ve also open-sourced three other   groundbreaking visual models along with their training data and model   weights — Segment Anything, DinoV2, and our Animated Drawings tool —  and  we’ve gotten positive feedback on all of those as well.  
I  think that there’s an important distinction between the products we  offer and a lot of the technical infrastructure, especially the software  that we write to support that. And historically, whether it’s the Open  Compute project that we’ve done or just open sourcing a lot of the   infrastructure that we’ve built, we’ve historically open sourced a lot   of that infrastructure, even though we haven’t open sourced the code for   our core products or anything like that.  
And the reason why I think why we do this is that unlike some of  the other companies in the space, **we’re not selling a cloud computing service** **where we try to keep the different software infrastructure that we’re building proprietary.** For us, **it’s way better if the industry  standardizes on the basic tools that we’re using**  and therefore we can benefit from the improvements that others make and  others’ use of those tools can, in some cases like Open Compute, **drive down the costs** of  those things which make our business more efficient too. So I think to  some degree **we’re just playing a different game** on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon, and that creates different incentives for us.  
So overall, I think **that that’s going to lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools**.  But of  course, a lot of the product work itself is going to be  specific and  integrated with the things that we do. So it’s not that  everything we do is going to be open. Obviously, a bunch of this needs  to be developed in a way that creates unique value for our products, but  I think in  terms of the basic models, **I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem** here, which I think is something that’s  going to be important.  
On the AI tools, and we have a bunch of history here, right? So if you  if you look at what we’ve done with **PyTorch**,  for example, which has  generally become the standard in the industry  as a tool that a lot of  folks who are building AI models and different  things in that space use,  **it’s generally been very valuable** for us to provide that because now  all of the **best developers across the industry are using tools that  we’re also using internally**.  So the tool chain is the same. So when they create some innovation, we  can easily integrate it into the things that we’re doing. When we  improve something, it improves other products too. Because it’s  integrated with our technology stack, when there are opportunities to  make integrations with products, it’s much easier to  make sure that  developers and other folks are compatible with the things  that we need  in the way that our systems work.  
So there are a lot of advantages, but **I view this more as a kind of back end infrastructure advantage with potential integrations on the  product side**,  but one that should hopefully enable us to stay at the  leading edge  and integrate more broadly with the community and also make  the way we  run all this infrastructure more efficient over time. There  are a  number of models. I just gave PyTorch as an example. Open Compute  is  another model that has worked really well for us in this way, both to   incorporate both innovation and scale efficiency into our own   infrastructure.  
So I think that  there’s, our incentives I think are basically  aligned towards moving in  this direction. Now that said, there’s a lot  to figure out, right? So  when you asked if there are going to be other opportunities, I hope so. I  can’t speak to what all those things might  be now. This is all quite  early in getting developed. **The better we do at the foundational work, the more opportunities** I think that will come and present themselves. So I think that that’s all stuff that we need to  figure out. But at least **at the base level, I think we’re generally incentivized to move in this direction**. And we also need to figure out  how to go in that direction over time.  
I  mean, I mentioned LLaMA before and I also want to be clear that  while  I’m talking about helping contribute to an open ecosystem, LLaMA  is a  model that we only really made available to researchers and there’s  a  lot of really good stuff that’s happening there. But a lot of the  work  that we’re doing, I think, **we would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that.**"

But it's not! A 100-1000x smaller parameter LLM given a few million games of chess will learn to play at ELO 1500.

This model is only trained to predict the next character in PGN strings (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and is never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess. Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the Elo rating of the players in the game.

We can visualize the internal board state of the model as it's predicting the next character. For example, in this heatmap, we have the ground truth white pawn location on the left, a binary probe output in the middle, and a gradient of probe confidence on the right. We can see the model is extremely confident that no white pawns are on either back rank.

[video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

These are my discoveries after ~100 hours of extensive experimentation and ways I think it can be improved.,NepNep_,False,0.9,307,12pqqg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12pqqg6/discussion_translation_of_japanese_to_english/,62,1681754083.0,"Hello. I am currently experimenting with the viability of LLM models for Japanese to English translation. I've been experimenting with GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 utilizing the DAN protocols, and GPT 4 for this project for around 3 months now with very promising results and I think I've identified several limitations with GPT that if addressed can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of translations.

&#x200B;

The project I'm working on is attempting to translate a light novel series from japanese to english. During these tests I did a deep dive, asking GPT how it is attempting the translations and asking it to modify its translation methodology through various means (I am considering doing a long video outlining all this and showing off the prompts and responses at a later date). Notably this includes asking it to utilize its understanding of the series its translating from its training knowledge to aide in the translation, and providing it with a ""seed"" translation. Basically the seed is a side by side japanese and english translation to show GPT what I'm looking for in terms of grammar and formatting. The english translation notably is a human translation, not a machine translation. The results from these tests provided SIGNIFICANT improvements to the final translation, so significant in fact that a large portion of the text could reasonably be assumed to be human-translated.

&#x200B;

Link to the project I'm working on so you can see my documentation and results: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT\_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

I've probably done around 50-100 hours of extensive testing with translation and methodology over the past 2-3 months. Over that time I've discovered the following:

1. Both GPT3 and GPT4 are significant improvements over traditional translation services such as google or deepl. This may be because Japanese and English are very different languages in how they are written and how their grammar works so prior translation services simply did a direct translation while GPT is capable of understanding the text and rewriting it to account for that. For example in japanese, there are no pronouns like ""he"" and ""her"" so a person's gender might not be clear from the sentence alone. Google Translate and DeepL typically just take a 50/50 guess, while GPT from my experience has been much more capable in getting this right based on understanding the larger context from the paragraph.
2. GPT has a tendency to censor text deliberately if it feels the translation may offend people. This isn't just for things that are blatantly offensive like slurs, it also includes mild sexual content, the kind that is typically approved for teen viewing/reading. The biggest problem is that it doesn't tell you it is censoring anything unless you ask it, meaning everything else may be a solid translation yet it may censor information which can ultimately hurt the translation, especially for story related translations like in my tests. These restrictions can be bypassed with correct prompting. I've had luck using GPT 3's DAN protocols however DAN's translations arent as strong as GPT 4, and I've had luck with GPT 4 by framing the translation as a game with extreme win and loss conditions and telling it that if it censors the translation, it may offend the author of the content since people in japan hold different values from our own.
3. GPT puts too high a focus on accuracy even if instructed not to. This is a good thing to a degree since outside of censorship you know the translation is accurate, however even when explicitly told to put maximum emphasis on readability, even if it hurts the accuracy, and it is allowed to rewrite sentences from the ground up to aide readability, it still puts too strong an emphasis on accuracy. I have determined this through testing that for some reason it is ignoring the request to focus on readability and will still maximize accuracy. The best way I've found to fix this issue is through demonstration, specifically the ""seed"" I mentioned earlier. By giving it a japanese and english translation of the same work but earlier in the story, it then understands how to put more emphasis on readability. The results is something that is 95% within the range of accuracy a professional translator would use while much easier to read.
4. GPT's biggest limitation is the fact that it ""forgets"" the seed way too quickly, usually within a few prompts. I've done testing with its data retention and it appears that if you give it too much information to remember at once it slowly bugs out. With GPT 3 its a hard crash type bug where it just spews nonsense unrelated to your request, however GPT 4 can remember a lot more information and will hard crash if you give it too much info but otherwise builds up errors slowly as you give it more info. I initially believed that there were issues with the token count, but further testing shows that the GPT model simply isn't optimized for this method of translation and a new or reworked model that you can give a seed and it will remember it longer would be better. The seed is one of the best tools for improving its performance

Next steps:

I would like to try to either create my own model or modify an existing one to optimize it for translation. If any1 knows any tools or guides I'd appreciate it."

tokenmonster is a novel approach to tokenization with broad-ranging use potential, but its primary motivation is to increase the inference speed and context-length of large language models by choosing better tokens. By selecting more optimal tokens, text can be represented with 20-30% less tokens compared to other modern tokenizing methods, increasing the speed of inference, training and the length of text by 20-30%. The code-optimized tokenizers do even better, [see it for yourself](https://bot.co/tokenmonster.html).

I also believe that tokenmonster vocabularies will improve the comprehension of Large Language Models. For more details see [How and Why](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster#how-and-why).

## Features

* Longer text generation at faster speed
* Determines the optimal token combination for a greedy tokenizer (non-greedy support coming)
* Successfully identifies common phrases and figures of speech
* Works with all languages and formats, even binary
* Quickly skims over HTML tags, sequential spaces, tabs, etc. without wasting context
* Does not require normalization or preprocessing of text
* Averages > 5 tokens per character
* No GPU needed

Edit: There is some misunderstanding about my ""performance"" claim, that claim is speed performance, not quality performance. By optimally tokenizing this increases the speed of inference and training (because there are less tokens to train and infer on), and it increases the total amount of text that can be output within the context-length (because the tokens decode to more text).

# The general intelligence factor in humans

In the early 1900s, Charles Spearman observed that children's performance across diverse school subjects was positively correlated (pictured below). He proposed the concept of a ""general intelligence factor,"" or *g*, to account for this correlation. This is why factor analysis was invented, it was invented by Spearman to quantify *g*.

&#x200B;

[The OG correlation matrix of school subjects](https://preview.redd.it/ohzhx16h6sub1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e0dd8e7b33571618cc2aa3399edabfbd873c12)

A century of research later, *g* has proven to be a robust and reliable construct. The positive correlations between various mental abilities, known as the positive manifold, have become one of the most replicated findings in differential psychology. The *g* factor typically accounts for over 40% of the variance in cognitive ability tests and serves as a strong predictor for various life outcomes.

While Spearman's original two-factor model suggested that intelligence comprises a general factor *g* and specific factors *s* unique to each test, contemporary research has refined this view. Current consensus holds that *g* sits atop a hierarchical model akin to the one shown below, underpinned by several first-order factors.

https://preview.redd.it/9cheo29n6sub1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2eadc486f9727933b24d9f808c3f7effc1b5fd0

# The general intelligence factor in non-human animals

The notion of general intelligence in non-human animals has been a subject of interest since the 1930, shortly after Spearman's concept gained traction. Empirical evidence suggests that *g* is not exclusive to humans. For instance, in rodents like mice, a *g* factor accounts for approximately 35% of the variance in cognitive performance. In a comprehensive meta-analysis covering non-human primates, a single factor explained 47% of the variance across 62 species, indicating a *g* factor similar to that in humans. Even in some bird species, such as bowerbirds, *g* explains over 44% of the variance in cognitive abilities.

However, it's worth noting that *g* may not be universal across all species. For example, evidence suggests that fish may not possess a *g* factor. Despite limitations like low sample size or limited task diversity in research on non-human animals, these findings indicate that *g* is not unique to humans and can sometimes be observed in various non-human species.

# Does g exist in language models?

I suspected *g* might exist in language models and prove itself to be both a powerful explanatory variable and an invaluable tool for measuring LLM ability.

To test for it's existence, I analyzed 1,232 models from the Open LLM Leaderboard and 88 models from the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) Leaderboard. A variety of cognitive subtests were used to assess the models, including ARC Challenge, Hellaswag,  TruthfulQA, MMLU subtests seen in the images below. Factor analysis techniques, specifically principal axis factoring, were employed to extract *g* from the performance data.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oz2yb78x6sub1.png?width=1103&format=png&auto=webp&s=92a853321e015fe17ba89637e0c3c3bf9d71cd14

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9q0an7k07sub1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=e18f216e1b880117a819ca17cda038d66889dcf9

As can be seen, correlations are uniformly positive (and extremely high) between all subtests, showing the existence of a ""positive manifold"". The average correlation in the matrices is .84, exactly the same for both datasets.

There was agreement for all statistical tests across both datasets that a single factor should be extracted (with only a single exception which was dismissed, as discussed in detail in the paper).

After factor analysis was performed, *g* loadings for subtests were obtained. Loosely speaking, the *g* loading is a correlation between *g* and the specific subtest.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m9xuj5c97sub1.png?width=435&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aad5fdaa2dbfa015fb317004c4d6af1dfc163bd

For the sake of brevity I won't post the subtest loading table for GLUE, but that's in the original paper as well. In there, loadings are .78 to .97 approximately.

Now here is an example of how we can rank models according to their general ability:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hrrbvwkg7sub1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=9afa927a7f0674a8946c6b6f5beaae9d1bb63099

In conclusion, both datasets showed an existence of *g* in language models. We now have a new unified method of ranking models based on how generally capable they are across tasks.

# How ""strong"" is g in language models?

About twice as strong as in humans and some animals.

The *g* factor in language models explains 85% of the variance on all tasks, in contrast to roughly 40% for humans and some animals. The number 85% is exactly replicated in both datasets.

The subtask *g* loading averages about .92, significantly higher than about .6 for humans.

# How reliable is g in language models?

After confirming that *g* is reliable across populations (i.e. it exists in both datasets), the study also included reliability analyses to assess the stability of *g* across test batteries and methods of extraction. In short, I wanted to see if we are actually measuring the same thing when we extract *g* from the same language models tested on 2 completely different test batteries.

I'll spare you the details on this one, but the correlation between *g* extracted from disjoint test batteries is basically 1. Same goes for different methods of extraction of *g*, like using PCA instead of FA. The *g* factor is therefore unique and highly reliable.

# Correlation between model size and g

Finally, the relationship between model size and *g* was explored. In short, the correlation was found to be r = .48 (p < .0001; 95% CI \[.44, .52\]). So, there exists a moderate/strong positive relationship between model size and *g*.

# Implications & Future Research

The identification of *g* in language models firstly allows us to measure what we actually want to measure (and compare) in language models, that is general ability. It allows the whole field to have a unified metric that can be used whenever we care more about general ability than some specific ability (like virology knowledge), which is almost always the case.

Another benefit of using *g* as the primary measure of ability in language models is that it prevents researchers fiddling with the administered test(s) until you find the specific test which seems to show that your model is better than the rest. It standardizes ability measurements in LLMs.

Plus, even if your improvement in a specific ability is real and not HARKed / p-hacked to death, it may still be just that, an improvement in specific abilities that don't affect general intelligence at all. This is obviously important to know when an improvement is discussed, and *g* is the measure that can tell us which is it. As an example of specific non-*g* improvements in humans, look up ""Flynn effect"".

I'd argue there's a big resource efficiency gain too, because now you can evaluate your model on a few carefully chosen *g*\-loaded subtests, derive *g* and infer the model's performance on all other tasks instead of testing your model on 200 tests each with 50+ items (like BigBench does, for example).

Apart from that, this method also allows for an objective ranking of various tests based on their *g* loading, which in turn provides a standardized measure of test relevance for specific populations of language models.

As for future research, there's tons of things to do. I'm personally interested in confirming the factor structure of general intelligence in LLMs or seeing impact of fine-tuning and RLHF on *g*. One can also examine which variables other than model size explain variance in *g* or how general ability and social bias correlate. I'd have loved to do these things, and it wouldn't even be hard, but I couldn't because of resource constraints. If you're looking for a paper idea, feel free to continue where I left off.

# Summary / Abstract

This study uncovers the factor of general intelligence, or *g*, in language models, extending the psychometric theory traditionally applied to humans and certain animal species. Utilizing factor analysis on two extensive datasets—Open LLM Leaderboard with 1,232 models and General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) Leaderboard with 88 models—we find compelling evidence for a unidimensional, highly stable *g* factor that accounts for 85% of the variance in model performance. The study also finds a moderate correlation of .48 between model size and *g*. The discovery of the general intelligence factor in language models offers a unified metric for model evaluation and opens new avenues for more robust, *g*\-based model ability assessment. These findings lay the foundation for understanding and future research on artificial general intelligence from a psychometric perspective and have practical implications for model evaluation and development.

I checked out a new paper investigating why windowed attention fails for this.

By visualizing the attention maps, the researchers noticed LLMs heavily attend initial tokens as ""attention sinks"" even if meaningless. This anchors the distribution.

They realized evicting these sink tokens causes the attention scores to get warped, destabilizing predictions.

Their proposed ""StreamingLLM"" method simply caches a few initial sink tokens plus recent ones. This tweaks LLMs to handle crazy long texts. Models tuned with StreamingLLM smoothly processed sequences with millions of tokens, and were up to 22x faster than other approaches. 

Even cooler - adding a special ""\[Sink Token\]"" during pre-training further improved streaming ability. The model just used that single token as the anchor. I think the abstract says it best:

>We introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a **finite length attention window** to generalize to **infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning**. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.

TLDR: LLMs break on long convos. Researchers found they cling to initial tokens as attention sinks. Caching those tokens lets LLMs chat infinitely.

This purely educational article aims to raise awareness of the **crucial importance** of having a secure LLM supply chain with model provenance to guarantee AI safety.

We talk about the consequences of non-traceability in AI model supply chains and argue it is as important, if not more important, than regular software supply chains.

Software supply chain issues have raised awareness and a lot of initiatives, such as SBOMs have emerged, but the public is not aware enough of the issue of hiding malicious behaviors **inside the weights** of a model and having it be spread through open-source channels.

Even **open-sourcing** the whole process does not solve this issue. Indeed, due to the **randomness** in the hardware (especially the GPUs) and the software, it is [practically impossible to replicate the same weights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02326.pdf?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io) that have been open source. Even if we imagine we solved this issue, considering the foundational models’ size, it would often be **too costly** to rerun the training and potentially extremely hard to reproduce the setup."

Abstract:

>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on complex reasoning by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate intermediate reasoning chains as the rationale to infer the answer. However, existing CoT studies are mostly isolated in the language modality with LLMs, where LLMs are hard to deploy. To elicit CoT reasoning in multimodality, a possible solution is to fine-tune small language models by fusing the vision and language features to perform CoT reasoning. The key challenge is that those language models tend to generate hallucinated reasoning chains that mislead the answer inference. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we propose Multimodal-CoT that incorporates vision features in a decoupled training framework. The framework separates the rationale generation and answer inference into two stages. By incorporating the vision features in both stages, the model is able to generate effective rationales that contribute to answer inference. **With Multimodal-CoT, our model under 1 billion parameters outperforms the previous state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-3.5) by 16% (75.17%->91.68%) on the ScienceQA benchmark and even surpasses human performance.**

Abstract:

>Large language models have been widely adopted but require significant GPU memory for inference. We develop a procedure for Int8 matrix multiplication for feed-forward and attention projection layers in transformers, which cut the memory needed for inference by half while retaining full precision performance. With our method, a 175B parameter 16/32-bit checkpoint can be loaded, converted to Int8, and used immediately without performance degradation. This is made possible by understanding and working around properties of highly systematic emergent features in transformer language models that dominate attention and transformer predictive performance. To cope with these features, we develop a two-part quantization procedure, LLM.int8(). We first use vector-wise quantization with separate normalization constants for each inner product in the matrix multiplication, to quantize most of the features. **However, for the emergent outliers, we also include a new mixed-precision decomposition scheme, which isolates the outlier feature dimensions into a 16-bit matrix multiplication while still more than 99.9% of values are multiplied in 8-bit. Using LLM.int8(), we show empirically it is possible to perform inference in LLMs with up to 175B parameters without any performance degradation.** This result makes such models much more accessible, for example making it possible to **use OPT-175B/BLOOM on a single server with consumer GPUs.**

To block that token from an LLM is to make it unable to explain a pretty significant step in the history of modern LLMs.

Suggesting this topic for discussion, as I am trying to identify the current most important unsolved problems in AI research. Below are a few proposed items that are top of mind for me, would appreciate any input (what to add or what to remove from the list) and relevant sources.

---

Compositionality*. Ability to perform symbolic operations, generalize, including learning from a relatively small set of samples, and get the most out of every sample (sample efficiency and few-shot learning), etc. Also includes the ability to learn by receiving explicit instructions. (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01128)

Multimodality*. Ability to process and relate information from multiple modalities, like text, audio, visual, etc.

Ability to match knowledge to context. For e.g. the text generated by the LLM is a great match for a sci-fi novel, but not as advice to a patient regarding their medical condition.

Uncertainty awareness*. Ability to characterize uncertainty relative to the similarity of the current observations to the training data, explain it to an observer, and adjust behavior if necessary. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07882.pdf)

Catastrophic forgetting. It is a known limitation to continual learning, however, it seems like the large-scale models show an indication of robustness. (http://www.cognitionresearch.org/papers/overview/sparchai.pdf)

Enabling robust continuous learning in deployment. The current paradigm separates training and inference, while in biology intelligent creatures are capable of continuous learning. 

Figuring out an approach for the messy middle.
- Low-level operations with a focus on a very narrow scope and maximum efficiency seem reasonably straightforward and enjoy growing application in the industry. Noise removing, pattern recognition, recommenders, etc. Specialized ANNs seem to have success there.
- High-level abstract reasoning is being explored by large language and multi-modal models. Like our explicit reasoning (solving a math problem, or learning to operate a new coffee machine) it is extremely powerful, but also slow and resource-intensive. (E.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05608)
- But there is that middle, as in driving, where we still do fairly complex operations with very high reliability, precision, and responsiveness, all with low cognitive load (figuratively “on autopilot”). 

Explainability* - enabling human experts to understand the underlying factors of why an AI decision has been made.
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-04083-2_2

Alignment* - ensuring that AI is properly aligned with human values. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-020-09539-2

Energy efficiency. The human brain is believed to consume tens of W of power (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.172399499) while less capable LLMs like GPT-3 require several kW (estimated as the power consumption of DGX A100 based on https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/inp025/if_you_want_to_run_your_own_full_gpt3_instance/). Two orders of magnitude more."

In this case it was ChatGPT (3.5, the free version); but I can see this happening in any model.

Here's the prompt I used on a fresh session:

""Generate 60 random numbers coming from an exponential distribution with lambda=6.4. Don't write any code""

It outputs the following values:

0.013, 0.078, 0.266, 0.040, 0.117, 0.283, 0.048, 0.078, 0.181, 0.134, 0.017, 0.160, 0.052, 0.196, 0.096, 0.098, 0.019, 0.048, 0.141, 0.071, 0.106, 0.023, 0.197, 0.062, 0.029, 0.072, 0.111, 0.166, 0.080, 0.027, 0.124, 0.016, 0.135, 0.052, 0.078, 0.161, 0.078, 0.139, 0.068, 0.066, 0.039, 0.056, 0.018, 0.082, 0.180, 0.086, 0.024, 0.022, 0.057, 0.042, 0.050, 0.104, 0.099, 0.062, 0.016, 0.186, 0.043, 0.085, 0.145, 0.110.

I get to plot a histogram with the numbers and they are close to what I would consider an exponential distribution with such parameter (you can see the plot).

Given that GPT 3.5 does not have access to a Python interpreter, how on earth is it able to do so? I have also tried other distributions and parameters and it kind of works. It's not perfect, but with normal distributions it is usually close to what scipy.stats would generate.

I could understand that it can have learnt to interpret Python code to some extent, but honestly I can't find explanation for random sampling from a probability distribution. For a Normal distribution, I can tell it about the desired mean and variance, and it samples values that are more than reasonable (and close to the true mean/variance specified).

Any thoughts? I honestly am unable to wrap my head around how a LLM can have the understanding on how to sample tokens (at digit level) to fit any probability distribution. To me it seems very unlikely to have similar data either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages."

Abstract:

>Recent advancements in decision-making large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive performance across various benchmarks. However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing these methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess certain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, **specifically the ability to learn from mistakes**. **Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve novel problems through a process of trial and error.** Building on recent research, we propose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with **dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities.** To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective heuristic that **enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances, avoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment.** To assess our approach, we evaluate the agent's ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments and knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA environments. We observe success rates of 97% and 51%, respectively, and provide a discussion on the emergent property of self-reflection.

**Juergen Schmidhuber, Renowned 'Father Of Modern AI,' Says His Life’s Work Won't Lead To Dystopia**

*May 23, 2023. Contributed by [Hessie Jones](https://twitter.com/hessiejones).*

Amid the growing concern about the impact of more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on society, there are many in the technology community who fear the implications of the advancements in Generative AI if they go unchecked. Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber, a renowned scientist, artificial intelligence researcher and widely regarded as one of the pioneers in the field, is more optimistic. He declares that many of those who suddenly warn against the dangers of AI are just seeking publicity, exploiting the media’s obsession with killer robots which has attracted more attention than “good AI” for healthcare etc.

The potential to revolutionize various industries and improve our lives is clear, as are the equal dangers if bad actors leverage the technology for personal gain. Are we headed towards a dystopian future, or is there reason to be optimistic? I had a chance to sit down with Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber to understand his perspective on this seemingly fast-moving AI-train that will leap us into the future.

As a teenager in the 1970s, Juergen Schmidhuber became fascinated with the idea of creating intelligent machines that could learn and improve on their own, becoming smarter than himself within his lifetime. This would ultimately lead to his groundbreaking work in the field of deep learning.

In the 1980s, he studied computer science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he earned his diploma in 1987. His thesis was on the ultimate self-improving machines that, not only, learn through some pre-wired human-designed learning algorithm, but also learn and improve the learning algorithm itself. Decades later, this became a hot topic. He also received his Ph.D. at TUM in 1991 for work that laid some of the foundations of modern AI.

Schmidhuber is best known for his contributions to the development of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the most powerful type of artificial neural network that can process sequential data such as speech and natural language. With his students Sepp Hochreiter, Felix Gers, Alex Graves, Daan Wierstra, and others, he published architectures and training algorithms for the long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of RNN that is widely used in natural language processing, speech recognition, video games, robotics, and other applications. LSTM has become the most cited neural network of the 20th century, and Business Week called it ""[arguably the most commercial AI achievement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-15/google-amazon-and-facebook-owe-j-rgen-schmidhuber-a-fortune?leadSource=uverify%20wall).""

Throughout his career, Schmidhuber has received various awards and accolades for his groundbreaking work. In 2013, he was awarded the Helmholtz Prize, which recognizes significant contributions to the field of machine learning. In 2016, he was awarded the IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award for ""*pioneering contributions to deep learning and neural networks."" The media have often called him the “father of modern AI,*” because the [most cited neural networks](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/most-cited-neural-nets.html) all build on his lab’s work. He is quick to point out, however, that AI history [goes back centuries.](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html)

Despite his many accomplishments, at the age of 60, he feels mounting time pressure towards building an Artificial General Intelligence within his lifetime and remains committed to pushing the boundaries of AI research and development. He is currently director of the KAUST AI Initiative, scientific director of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, and co-founder and chief scientist of AI company NNAISENSE, whose motto is ""AI∀"" which is a math-inspired way of saying ""AI For All."" He continues to work on cutting-edge AI technologies and applications to improve human health and extend human lives and make lives easier for everyone.

*The following interview has been edited for clarity.*

**Jones: Thank you Juergen for joining me. You have signed letters warning about AI weapons. But you didn't sign the recent publication, ""Pause Gigantic AI Experiments: An Open Letter""? Is there a reason?**

**Schmidhuber:** Thank you Hessie. Glad to speak with you. I have realized that many of those who warn in public against the dangers of AI are just seeking publicity. I don't think the latest letter will have any significant impact because many AI researchers, companies, and governments will ignore it completely.

The proposal frequently uses the word ""we"" and refers to ""us,"" the humans. But as I have pointed out many times in the past, there is no ""we"" that everyone can identify with. Ask 10 different people, and you will hear 10 different opinions about what is ""good."" Some of those opinions will be completely incompatible with each other. Don't forget the enormous amount of conflict between the many people.

The letter also says, ""*If such a pause cannot be quickly put in place, governments should intervene and impose a moratorium.*"" The problem is that different governments have ALSO different opinions about what is good for them and for others. Great Power A will say, if we don't do it, Great Power B will, perhaps secretly, and gain an advantage over us. The same is true for Great Powers C and D.

**Jones: Everyone acknowledges this fear surrounding current generative AI technology. Moreover, the existential threat of this technology has been publicly acknowledged by** [**Sam Altman**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65616866)**, CEO of OpenAI himself, calling for AI regulation. From your perspective, is there an existential threat?**

**Schmidhuber:** It is true that AI can be weaponized, and I have no doubt that there will be all kinds of AI arms races, but AI does not introduce a new quality of existential threat. The threat coming from AI weapons seems to pale in comparison to the much older threat from nuclear hydrogen bombs that don’t need AI at all. We should be much more afraid of half-century-old tech in the form of H-bomb rockets. The Tsar Bomba of 1961 had almost 15 times more destructive power than all weapons of WW-II combined.  Despite the dramatic nuclear disarmament since the 1980s, there are still more than enough nuclear warheads to wipe out human civilization within two hours, without any AI I’m much more worried about that old existential threat than the rather harmless AI weapons.

**Jones: I realize that while you compare AI to the threat of nuclear bombs, there is a current danger that a current technology can be put in the hands of humans and enable them to “eventually” exact further harms to individuals of group in a very precise way, like targeted drone attacks. You are giving people a toolset that they've never had before, enabling bad actors, as some have pointed out, to be able to do a lot more than previously because they didn't have this technology.**

**Schmidhuber:** Now, all that sounds horrible in principle, but our existing laws are sufficient to deal with these new types of weapons enabled by AI. If you kill someone with a gun, you will go to jail. Same if you kill someone with one of these drones. Law enforcement will get better at understanding new threats and new weapons and will respond with better technology to combat these threats. Enabling drones to target persons from a distance in a way that requires some tracking and some intelligence to perform, which has traditionally been performed by skilled humans, to me, it seems is just an improved version of a traditional weapon, like a gun, which is, you know, a little bit smarter than the old guns.

But, in principle, all of that is not a new development. For many centuries, we have had the evolution of better weaponry and deadlier poisons and so on, and law enforcement has evolved their policies to react to these threats over time. So, it's not that we suddenly have a new quality of existential threat and it's much more worrisome than what we have had for about six decades. A large nuclear warhead doesn’t need fancy face recognition to kill an individual. No, it simply wipes out an entire city with ten million inhabitants.

**Jones: The existential threat that’s implied is the extent to which humans have control over this technology. We see some early cases of opportunism which, as you say, tends to get more media attention than positive breakthroughs. But you’re implying that this will all balance out?**

**Schmidhuber:** Historically, we have a long tradition of technological breakthroughs that led to advancements in weapons for the purpose of defense but also for protection. From sticks, to rocks, to axes to gunpowder to cannons to rockets… and now to drones… this has had a drastic influence on human history but what has been consistent throughout history is that those who are using technology to achieve their own ends are themselves, facing the same technology because the opposing side is learning to use it against them. And that's what has been repeated in thousands of years of human history and it will continue. I don't see the new AI arms race as something that is remotely as existential a threat as the good old nuclear warheads.

You said something important, in that some people prefer to talk about the downsides rather than the benefits of this technology, but that's misleading, because 95% of all AI research and AI development is about making people happier and advancing human life and health.

**Jones: Let’s touch on some of those beneficial advances in AI research that have been able to radically change present day methods and achieve breakthroughs.**

**Schmidhuber:** All right! For example, eleven years ago, our team with my postdoc Dan Ciresan was the first to win a [medical imaging competition through deep learning](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/first-time-deep-learning-won-medical-imaging-contest-september-2012.html). We analyzed female breast cells with the objective to determine harmless cells vs. those in the pre-cancer stage. Typically, a trained oncologist needs a long time to make these determinations. Our team, who knew nothing about cancer, were able to train an artificial neural network, which was totally dumb in the beginning, on lots of this kind of data. It was able to outperform all the other methods. Today, this is being used not only for breast cancer, but also for radiology and detecting plaque in arteries, and many other things.  Some of the neural networks that we have developed in the last 3 decades are now prevalent across thousands of healthcare applications, detecting Diabetes and Covid-19 and what not. This will eventually permeate across all healthcare. The good consequences of this type of AI are much more important than the click-bait new ways of conducting crimes with AI.

**Jones: Adoption is a product of reinforced outcomes. The massive scale of adoption either leads us to believe that people have been led astray, or conversely, technology is having a positive effect on people’s lives.**

**Schmidhuber:** The latter is the likely case. There's intense commercial pressure towards good AI rather than bad AI because companies want to sell you something, and you are going to buy only stuff you think is going to be good for you. So already just through this simple, commercial pressure, you have a tremendous bias towards good AI rather than bad AI. However, doomsday scenarios like in Schwarzenegger movies grab more attention than documentaries on AI that improve people’s lives.

**Jones: I would argue that people are drawn to good stories – narratives that contain an adversary and struggle, but in the end, have happy endings. And this is consistent with your comment on human nature and how history, despite its tendency for violence and destruction of humanity, somehow tends to correct itself.**

**Let’s take the example of a technology, which you are aware – GANs – General Adversarial Networks, which today has been used in applications for fake news and disinformation. In actuality, the purpose in the invention of GANs was far from what it is used for today.**

**Schmidhuber:** Yes, the name GANs was created in 2014 but we had the basic principle already in the early 1990s. More than 30 years ago, I called it *artificial curiosity*. It's a very simple way of injecting creativity into a little two network system. This creative AI is not just trying to slavishly imitate humans. Rather, it’s inventing its own goals. Let me explain:

You have two networks. One network is producing outputs that could be anything, any action. Then the second network is looking at these actions and it’s trying to predict the consequences of these actions. An action could move a robot, then something happens, and the other network is just trying to predict what will happen.

Now we can implement artificial curiosity by reducing the prediction error of the second network, which, at the same time, is the reward of the first network. The first network wants to maximize its reward and so it will invent actions that will lead to situations that will surprise the second network, which it has not yet learned to predict well.

In the case where the outputs are fake images, the first network will try to generate images that are good enough to fool the second network, which will attempt to predict the reaction of the environment: fake or real image, and it will try to become better at it. The first network will continue to also improve at generating images whose type the second network will not be able to predict. So, they fight each other. The 2nd network will continue to reduce its prediction error, while the 1st network will attempt to maximize it.

Through this zero-sum game the first network gets better and better at producing these convincing fake outputs which look almost realistic. So, once you have an interesting set of images by Vincent Van Gogh, you can generate new images that leverage his style, without the original artist having ever produced the artwork himself.

**Jones: I see how the Van Gogh example can be applied in an education setting and there are countless examples of artists mimicking styles from famous painters but image generation from this instance that can happen within seconds is quite another feat. And you know this is how GANs has been used. What’s more prevalent today is a socialized enablement of generating images or information to intentionally fool people. It also surfaces new harms that deal with the threat to intellectual property and copyright, where laws have yet to account for. And from your perspective this was not the intention when the model was conceived. What was your motivation in your early conception of what is now GANs?**

**Schmidhuber:** My old motivation for GANs was actually very important and it was not to create deepfakes or fake news but to enable AIs to be curious and invent their own goals, to make them explore their environment and make them creative.

Suppose you have a robot that executes one action, then something happens, then it executes another action, and so on, because it wants to achieve certain goals in the environment. For example, when the battery is low, this will trigger “pain” through hunger sensors, so it wants to go to the charging station, without running into obstacles, which will trigger other pain sensors. It will seek to minimize pain (encoded through numbers). Now the robot has a friend, the second network, which is a world model ––it’s a prediction machine that learns to predict the consequences of the robot’s actions.

Once the robot has a good model of the world, it can use it for planning. It can be used as a simulation of the real world. And then it can determine what is a good action sequence. If the robot imagines this sequence of actions, the model will predict a lot of pain, which it wants to avoid. If it plays this alternative action sequence in its mental model of the world, then it will predict a rewarding situation where it’s going to sit on the charging station and its battery is going to load again. So, it'll prefer to execute the latter action sequence.

In the beginning, however, the model of the world knows nothing, so how can we motivate the first network to generate experiments that lead to data that helps the world model learn something it didn’t already know? That’s what artificial curiosity is about. The dueling two network systems effectively explore uncharted environments by creating experiments so that over time the curious AI gets a better sense of how the environment works. This can be applied to all kinds of environments, and has medical applications.

**Jones: Let’s talk about the future. You have said, “*****Traditional humans won’t play a significant role in spreading intelligence across the universe.*****”**

**Schmidhuber:** Let’s first conceptually separate two types of AIs. The first type of AI are tools directed by humans. They are trained to do specific things like accurately detect diabetes or heart disease and prevent attacks before they happen. In these cases, the goal is coming from the human. More interesting AIs are setting their own goals. They are inventing their own experiments and learning from them. Their horizons expand and eventually they become more and more general problem solvers in the real world. They are not controlled by their parents, but much of what they learn is through self-invented experiments.

A robot, for example, is rotating a toy, and as it is doing this, the video coming in through the camera eyes, changes over time and it begins to learn how this video changes and learns how the 3D nature of the toy generates certain videos if you rotate it a certain way, and eventually, how gravity works, and how the physics of the world works. Like a little scientist!

And I have predicted for decades that future scaled-up versions of such AI scientists will want to further expand their horizons, and eventually go where most of the physical resources are, to build more and bigger AIs. And of course, almost all of these resources are far away from earth out there in space, which is hostile to humans but friendly to appropriately designed AI-controlled robots and self-replicating robot factories. So here we are not talking any longer about our tiny biosphere; no, we are talking about the much bigger rest of the universe.  Within a few tens of billions of years, curious self-improving [AIs will colonize the visible cosmos](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/falling-walls-the-past-present-and-future-of-artificial-intelligence/) in a way that’s infeasible for humans. Those who don’t won’t have an impact. Sounds like science fiction, but since the 1970s I have been unable to see a plausible alternative to this scenario, except for a global catastrophe such as an all-out nuclear war that stops this development before it takes off.

**Jones: How long have these AIs, which can set their own goals — how long have they existed? To what extent can they be independent of human interaction?**

**Schmidhuber:** Neural networks like that have existed for over 30 years. My first simple adversarial neural network system of this kind is the one from 1990 described above. You don’t need a teacher there; it's just a little agent running around in the world and trying to invent new experiments that surprise its own prediction machine.

Once it has figured out certain parts of the world, the agent will become bored and will move on to more exciting experiments. The simple 1990 systems I mentioned have certain limitations, but in the past three decades, we have also built more [sophisticated systems that are setting their own goals](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/artificial-curiosity-since-1990.html) and such systems I think will be essential for achieving true intelligence. If you are only imitating humans, you will never go beyond them. So, you really must give AIs the freedom to explore previously unexplored regions of the world in a way that no human is really predefining.

**Jones: Where is this being done today?**

**Schmidhuber:** Variants of neural network-based artificial curiosity are used today for agents that learn to play video games in a human-competitive way. We have also started to use them for automatic design of experiments in fields such as materials science. I bet many other fields will be affected by it: chemistry, biology, drug design, you name it. However, at least for now, these artificial scientists, as I like to call them, cannot yet compete with human scientists.

I don’t think it’s going to stay this way but, at the moment, it’s still the case.  Sure, AI has made a lot of progress. Since 1997, there have been superhuman chess players, and since 2011, through the DanNet of my team, there have been [superhuman visual pattern recognizers](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/DanNet-triggers-deep-CNN-revolution-2011.html). But there are other things where humans, at the moment at least, are much better, in particular, science itself.  In the lab we have many first examples of self-directed artificial scientists, but they are not yet convincing enough to appear on the radar screen of the public space, which is currently much more fascinated with simpler systems that just imitate humans and write texts based on previously seen human-written documents.

**Jones: You speak of these numerous instances dating back 30 years of these lab experiments where these self-driven agents are deciding and learning and moving on once they’ve learned. And I assume that that rate of learning becomes even faster over time. What kind of timeframe are we talking about when this eventually is taken outside of the lab and embedded into society?**

**Schmidhuber:** This could still take months or even years :-) Anyway, in the not-too-distant future, we will probably see artificial scientists who are good at devising experiments that allow them to discover new, previously unknown physical laws.

As always, we are going to profit from the old trend that has held at least since 1941: every decade compute is getting 100 times cheaper.

**Jones: How does this trend affect modern AI such as ChatGPT?**

**Schmidhuber:** Perhaps you know that all the recent famous AI applications such as ChatGPT and similar models are largely based on principles of artificial neural networks invented in the previous millennium. The main reason why they works so well now is the incredible acceleration of compute per dollar.

ChatGPT is driven by a neural network called “Transformer” described in 2017 by Google. I am happy about that because a quarter century earlier in 1991 I had a particular Transformer variant which is now called the “[Transformer with linearized self-attention](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI/status/1576966129993797632?cxt=HHwWgMDSkeKVweIrAAAA)”. Back then, not much could be done with it, because the compute cost was a million times higher than today. But today, one can train such models on half the internet and achieve much more interesting results.

**Jones: And for how long will this acceleration continue?**

**Schmidhuber:** There's no reason to believe that in the next 30 years, we won't have another factor of 1 million and that's going to be really significant. In the near future, for the first time we will have many not-so expensive devices that can compute as much as a human brain. The physical limits of computation, however, are much further out so even if the trend of a factor of 100 every decade continues, the physical limits (of 1051 elementary instructions per second and kilogram of matter) won’t be hit until, say, the mid-next century. Even in our current century, however, we’ll probably have many machines that compute more than all 10 billion human brains collectively and you can imagine, everything will change then!

**Jones: That is the big question. Is everything going to change? If so, what do you say to the next generation of leaders, currently coming out of college and university. So much of this change is already impacting how they study, how they will work, or how the future of work and livelihood is defined. What is their purpose and how do we change our systems so they will adapt to this new version of intelligence?**

**Schmidhuber:** For decades, people have asked me questions like that, because you know what I'm saying now, I have basically said since the 1970s, it’s just that today, people are paying more attention because, back then, they thought this was science fiction.

They didn't think that I would ever come close to achieving my crazy life goal of building a machine that learns to become smarter than myself such that I can retire. But now many have changed their minds and think it's conceivable. And now I have two daughters, 23 and 25. People ask me: what do I tell them? They know that Daddy always said, “*It seems likely that within your lifetimes, you will have new types of intelligence that are probably going to be superior in many ways, and probably all kinds of interesting ways.*” How should they prepare for that? And I kept telling them the obvious: **Learn how to learn new things**! It's not like in the previous millennium where within 20 years someone learned to be a useful member of society, and then took a job for 40 years and performed in this job until she received her pension. Now things are changing much faster and we must learn continuously just to keep up. I also told my girls that no matter how smart AIs are going to get, learn at least the basics of math and physics, because that’s the essence of our universe, and anybody who understands this will have an advantage, and learn all kinds of new things more easily. I also told them that social skills will remain important, because most future jobs for humans will continue to involve interactions with other humans, but I couldn’t teach them anything about that; they know much more about social skills than I do.

You touched on the big philosophical question about people’s purpose. Can this be answered without answering the even grander question: What’s the purpose of the entire universe?

We don’t know. But what’s happening right now might be connected to the unknown answer. Don’t think of humans as the crown of creation. Instead view human civilization as part of a much grander scheme, an important step (but not the last one) on the path of the universe from very simple initial conditions towards more and more unfathomable complexity. Now it seems ready to take its [next step, a step comparable to the invention of life itself over 3.5 billion years ago](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html#future).  Alas, don’t worry, in the end, all will be good!

**Jones: Let’s get back to this transformation happening right now with OpenAI. There are many questioning the efficacy and accuracy of ChatGPT, and are concerned its release has been premature. In light of the rampant adoption, educators have banned its use over concerns of plagiarism and how it stifles individual development. Should large language models like ChatGPT be used in school?**

**Schmidhuber:** When the calculator was first introduced, instructors forbade students from using it in school. Today, the consensus is that kids should learn the basic methods of arithmetic, but they should also learn to use the “artificial multipliers” aka calculators, even in exams, because laziness and efficiency is a hallmark of intelligence. Any intelligent being wants to minimize its efforts to achieve things.

And that's the reason why we have tools, and why our kids are learning to use these tools. The first stone tools were invented maybe 3.5 million years ago; tools just have become more sophisticated over time. In fact, humans have changed in response to the properties of their tools. Our anatomical evolution was shaped by tools such as spears and fire. So, it's going to continue this way. And there is no permanent way of preventing large language models from being used in school.

**Jones: And when our children, your children graduate, what does their future work look like?**

**Schmidhuber:** A single human trying to predict details of how 10 billion people and their machines will evolve in the future is like a single neuron in my brain trying to predict what the entire brain and its tens of billions of neurons will do next year. 40 years ago, before the WWW was created at CERN in Switzerland, who would have predicted all those young people making money as YouTube video bloggers?

Nevertheless, let’s make a few limited job-related observations. For a long time, people have thought that desktop jobs may require more intelligence than skills trade or handicraft professions. But now, it turns out that it's much easier to replace certain aspects of desktop jobs than replacing a carpenter, for example. Because everything that works well in AI is happening behind the screen currently, but not so much in the physical world.

There are now artificial systems that can read lots of documents and then make really nice summaries of these documents. That is a desktop job. Or you give them a description of an illustration that you want to have for your article and pretty good illustrations are being generated that may need some minimal fine-tuning. But you know, all these desktop jobs are much easier to facilitate than the real tough jobs in the physical world. And it's interesting that the things people thought required intelligence, like playing chess, or writing or summarizing documents, are much easier for machines than they thought. But for things like playing football or soccer, there is no physical robot that can remotely compete with the abilities of a little boy with these skills. So, AI in the physical world, interestingly, is much harder than AI behind the screen in virtual worlds. And it's really exciting, in my opinion, to see that jobs such as plumbers are much more challenging than playing chess or writing another tabloid story.

**Jones: The way data has been collected in these large language models does not guarantee personal information has not been excluded. Current consent laws already are outdated when it comes to these large language models (LLM). The concern, rightly so, is increasing surveillance and loss of privacy. What is your view on this?**

**Schmidhuber:** As I have indicated earlier: are surveillance and loss of privacy inevitable consequences of increasingly complex societies? Super-organisms such as cities and states and companies consist of numerous people, just like people consist of numerous cells. These cells enjoy little privacy. They are constantly monitored by specialized ""police cells"" and ""border guard cells"": Are you a cancer cell? Are you an external intruder, a pathogen? Individual cells sacrifice their freedom for the benefits of being part of a multicellular organism.

Similarly, for super-organisms such as nations. Over 5000 years ago, writing enabled recorded history and thus became its inaugural and most important invention. Its initial purpose, however, was to facilitate surveillance, to track citizens and their tax payments. The more complex a super-organism, the more comprehensive its collection of information about its constituents.

200 years ago, at least, the parish priest in each village knew everything about all the village people, even about those who did not confess, because they appeared in the confessions of others. Also, everyone soon knew about the stranger who had entered the village, because some occasionally peered out of the window, and what they saw got around. Such control mechanisms were temporarily lost through anonymization in rapidly growing cities but are now returning with the help of new surveillance devices such as smartphones as part of digital nervous systems that tell companies and governments a lot about billions of users. Cameras and drones etc. are becoming increasingly tinier and more ubiquitous. More effective recognition of faces and other detection technology are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and many will use it to identify others anywhere on earth; the big wide world will not offer any more privacy than the local village. Is this good or bad? Some nations may find it easier than others to justify more complex kinds of super-organisms at the expense of the privacy rights of their constituents.

**Jones: So, there is no way to stop or change this process of collection, or how it continuously informs decisions over time? How do you see governance and rules responding to this, especially amid** [**Italy’s ban on ChatGPT following**](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/italy-has-banned-chatgpt-heres-what-other-countries-are-doing.html) **suspected user data breach and the more recent news about the** [**Meta’s record $1.3billion fine**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-given-record-13-bln-fine-given-5-months-stop-eu-us-data-flows-2023-05-22/) **in the company’s handling of user information?**

**Schmidhuber:** Data collection has benefits and drawbacks, such as the loss of privacy. How to balance those? I have argued for addressing this through data ownership in data markets. If it is true that data is the new oil, then it should have a price, just like oil. At the moment, the major surveillance platforms such as Meta do not offer users any money for their data and the transitive loss of privacy. In the future, however, we will likely see attempts at creating efficient data markets to figure out the data's true financial value through the interplay between supply and demand.

Even some of the sensitive medical data should not be priced by governmental regulators but by patients (and healthy persons) who own it and who may sell or license parts thereof as micro-entrepreneurs in a healthcare data market.

Following a previous [interview](https://www.swissre.com/institute/conferences/The-intelligence-behind-artificial-intelligence.html), I gave for one of the largest re-insurance companies , let's look at the different participants in such a data market: patients, hospitals, data companies. (1) **Patients** with a rare form of cancer can offer more valuable data than patients with a very common form of cancer. (2) **Hospitals** and their machines are needed to extract the data, e.g., through magnet spin tomography, radiology, evaluations through human doctors, and so on. (3) **Companies** such as Siemens, Google or IBM would like to buy annotated data to make better artificial neural networks that learn to predict pathologies and diseases and the consequences of therapies. Now the market’s invisible hand will decide about the data’s price through the interplay between demand and supply. On the demand side, you will have several companies offering something for the data, maybe through an app on the smartphone (a bit like a stock market app). On the supply side, each patient in this market should be able to profit from high prices for rare valuable types of data. Likewise, competing data extractors such as hospitals will profit from gaining recognition and trust for extracting data well at a reasonable price. The market will make the whole system efficient through incentives for all who are doing a good job. Soon there will be a flourishing ecosystem of commercial data market advisors and what not, just like the ecosystem surrounding the traditional stock market. The value of the data won’t be determined by governments or ethics committees, but by those who own the data and decide by themselves which parts thereof they want to license to others under certain conditions.

At first glance, a market-based system seems to be detrimental to the interest of certain monopolistic companies, as they would have to pay for the data - some would prefer free data and keep their monopoly. However, since every healthy and sick person in the market would suddenly have an incentive to collect and share their data under self-chosen anonymity conditions, there will soon be many more useful data to evaluate all kinds of treatments. On average, people will live longer and healthier, and many companies and the entire healthcare system will benefit.

**Jones: Finally, what is your view on open source versus the private companies like Google and OpenAI? Is there a danger to supporting these private companies’ large language models versus trying to keep these models open source and transparent, very much like what LAION is doing?**

**Schmidhuber:** I signed this [open letter by LAION](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2023/04/19/amid-growing-call-to-pause-ai-research-laion-petitions-governments-to-keep-agi-research-open-active-and-responsible/?sh=6973c08b62e3) because I strongly favor the open-source movement. And I think it's also something that is going to challenge whatever big tech dominance there might be at the moment. Sure, the best models today are run by big companies with huge budgets for computers, but the exciting fact is that open-source models are not so far behind, some people say maybe six to eight months only. Of course, the private company models are all based on stuff that was created in academia, often in little labs without so much funding, which publish without patenting their results and open source their code and others take it and improved it.

Big tech has profited tremendously from academia; their main achievement being that they have scaled up everything greatly, sometimes even failing to credit the original inventors.

So, it's very interesting to see that as soon as some big company comes up with a new scaled-up model, lots of students out there are competing, or collaborating, with each other, trying to come up with equal or better performance on smaller networks and smaller machines. And since they are open sourcing, the next guy can have another great idea to improve it, so now there’s tremendous competition also for the big companies.

Because of that, and since AI is still getting exponentially cheaper all the time, I don't believe that big tech companies will dominate in the long run. They find it very hard to compete with the enormous open-source movement. As long as you can encourage the open-source community, I think you shouldn't worry too much. Now, of course, you might say if everything is open source, then the bad actors also will more easily have access to these AI tools. And there's truth to that. But as always since the invention of controlled fire, it was good that knowledge about how technology works quickly became public such that everybody could use it. And then, against any bad actor, there's almost immediately a counter actor trying to nullify his efforts. You see, I still believe in our old motto ""AI∀"" or ""AI For All.""

**Jones: Thank you, Juergen for sharing your perspective on this amazing time in history. It’s clear that with new technology, the enormous potential can be matched by disparate and troubling risks which we’ve yet to solve, and even those we have yet to identify. If we are to dispel the fear of a sentient system for which we have no control, humans, alone need to take steps for more responsible development and collaboration to ensure AI technology is used to ultimately benefit society. Humanity will be judged by what we do next.**"

Even transformers, which are an extremely clever way of using attention, are really really really good, and I don't even think the people who wrote the ""Attention is all you need"" paper could visualize the massive impact they would have on ML.

Idk whether I'm being overly skeptical but all of this just seems too good to be true. We've made so many discoveries and we have almost no explanation for a lot of them besides ""it's cool to multiply matrices like this"". What is going on? Am I misunderstood or am I describing something real?"

>WikiChat generates a response from an LLM, retains only the grounded facts, and combines them with additional information it retrieves from the corpus to form factual and engaging responses. **We distill WikiChat based on GPT-4 into a 7B-parameter LLaMA model with minimal loss of quality, to significantly improve its latency, cost and privacy, and facilitate research and deployment.**  
>  
>Using a novel hybrid human-and-LLM evaluation methodology, we show that our best system achieves 97.3% factual accuracy in simulated conversations. It significantly outperforms all retrieval-based and LLM-based baselines, and by 3.9%, 38.6% and 51.0% on head, tail and recent knowledge compared to GPT-4. Compared to previous state-of-the-art retrieval-based chatbots, WikiChat is also significantly more informative and engaging, just like an LLM.

>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved excellent performances in various tasks. However, fine-tuning an LLM requires extensive supervision. Human, on the other hand, may improve their reasoning abilities by self-thinking without external inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that an LLM is also capable of self-improving with only unlabeled datasets. We use a pre-trained LLM to generate ""high-confidence"" rationale-augmented answers for unlabeled questions using Chain-of-Thought prompting and self-consistency, and fine-tune the LLM using those self-generated solutions as target outputs. We show that our approach improves the general reasoning ability of a 540B-parameter LLM (74.4%->82.1% on GSM8K, 78.2%->83.0% on DROP, 90.0%->94.4% on OpenBookQA, and 63.4%->67.9% on ANLI-A3) and achieves state-of-the-art-level performance, without any ground truth label. We conduct ablation studies and show that fine-tuning on reasoning is critical for self-improvement."

In our experience these costs dominate end-to-end user experienced latency, rather than actual model or ANN algorithms, which unfortunately limits what is achievable for interactive applications. 

We've extended Postgres w/ open source models from Huggingface, as well as vector search, and classical ML algos, so that everything can happen in the same process. It's significantly faster and cheaper, which leaves a large latency budget available to expand model and algorithm complexity.

Here is a series of posts explaining how to accomplish the complexity involved in a typical ML powered application, as a single SQL query, that runs in a single process with memory shared between models and feature indexes, including learned embeddings and reranking models.

* [Personalize embedding results with application data](https://postgresml.org/blog/personalize-embedding-vector-search-results-with-huggingface-and-pgvector)

This allows a single SQL query to accomplish what would normally be an entire application w/ several model services and databases

 e.g. for a modern chatbot built across various services and databases

1. application sends user input data to embedding service
   1. embedding model generates a vector to send back to application
2. application sends vector to vector database
   1. vector database returns associated metadata found via ANN
3. application sends metadata for reranking
   1. reranking model prunes less helpful context
4. application sends finished prompt w/ context to generative model
   1. model produces final output
5. application streams response to user

Detailed breakdown: [https://blog.pythagora.ai/2023/08/23/430/](https://blog.pythagora.ai/2023/08/23/430/)

For a couple of months, I've been thinking about how can GPT be utilized to generate fully working apps, and I still haven't seen any project that I think has a good approach. I just don't think that Smol developer or GPT engineer can create a fully working production-ready app from scratch without a developer being involved and without any debugging process.

So, I came up with an idea that I've outlined thoroughly in the blog post above, but basically, I have 3 main ""pillars"" that I think a dev tool that generates apps needs to have:

1. **Developer needs to be involved in the process of app creation** \- I think that we are still far away from an LLM that can just be hooked up to a CLI and work by itself to create any kind of an app by itself. Nevertheless, GPT-4 works amazingly well when writing code, and it might be able to even write most of the codebase - but NOT all of it. That's why I think we need a tool that will write most of the code while the developer oversees what the AI is doing and gets involved when needed. When he/she changes the code, GPT Pilot needs to continue working with those changes (eg. adding an API key or fixing a bug when AI gets stuck).
2. **The app needs to be coded step by step** just like a human developer would. All other code generators just give you the entire codebase, which I very hard to get into. I think that if AI creates the app step by step, it will be able to debug it more easily, and the developer who's overseeing it will be able to understand the code better and fix issues as they arise.
3. **This tool needs to be scalable** in a way that it should be able to create a small app the same way it should create a big, production-ready app. There should be mechanisms that enable AI to debug any issue and get requirements for new features so it can continue working on an already-developed app.

So, having these in mind, I created a PoC for a dev tool that can create any kind of app from scratch while the developer oversees what is being developed. I call it **GPT Pilot**.

# Examples

**Here are a couple of demo apps that GPT Pilot created:**

1. [Real time chat app](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot-chat-app-demo)
2. [Markdown editor](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot-demo-markdown-editor.git)
3. [Timer app](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot-timer-app-demo)

How it works

Basically, it acts as a development agency where you enter a short description about what you want to build - then, it clarifies the requirements and builds the code. I'm using a different agent for each step in the process. Here are the diagrams of how GPT Pilot works:

# Concepts that GPT Pilot uses

**Recursive conversations** (as I call them) are conversations with the LLM that are set up in a way that they can be used “recursively”. For example, if GPT Pilot detects an error, it needs to debug it but let’s say that, during the debugging process, another error happens. Then, GPT Pilot needs to stop debugging the first issue, fix the second one, and then get back to fixing the first issue. This is a very important concept that, I believe, needs to work to make AI build large and scalable apps by itself. It works by rewinding the context and explaining each error in the recursion separately. Once the deepest level error is fixed, we move up in the recursion and continue fixing that error. We do this until the entire recursion is completed.

**Context rewinding** is a relatively simple idea. For solving each development task, the context size of the first message to the LLM has to be relatively the same. For example, *the context size of the first LLM message while implementing development task #5 has to be more or less the same as the first message while developing task #50.* Because of this, the conversation needs to be rewound to the first message upon each task. When GPT Pilot creates code, **it creates the pseudocode** for each code block that it writes as well as **descriptions for each file and folder** that it creates. So, when we need to implement task #50, in a separate conversation, we show the LLM the current folder/file structure; it selects only the code that is relevant for the current task, and then, in the original conversation, we show only the selected code instead of the entire codebase. [Here's a diagram](https://blogpythagora.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/pythagora-product-development-frame-3-1.jpg?w=1714) of what this looks like.

**This is still a research project, so I'm wondering what scientists here think about this approach. What areas would you pay more attention to? What do you think can become a big blocker that will prevent GPT Pilot to, eventually, create a full production-ready app?**"

## What

### Godot 

The Godot Engine is a free, all-in-one, cross-platform game engine that makes it easy for you to create 2D and 3D games.

### RWKV

RWKV is an RNN with Transformer-level LLM performance, which can also be directly trained like a GPT transformer (parallelizable). And it's 100% attention-free. You only need the hidden state at position t to compute the state at position t+1.

### RWKV-CPP-CUDA

RWKV-CPP-CUDA is a c++/cuda library I created that implements the RWKV inference code in pure cuda. This allows for compiled code with no torch or python dependencies, while allowing the full use of GPU acceleration.
The code implements 8bit inference, allowing for quick and light inference.

### Godot+RWKV

Godot+RWKV is a Godot module that I developed using RWKV-CPP-CUDA, and allows the development of games and programs using RWKV to be developed and distributed using godot, without the need to install complex environments and libraries, for both developers and consumers.

## Why

* I felt I could achieve it
* Its something thats needed to advance the use of AI in consumer devices
* The lols
* Attention, because I didnt get much growing up, and RWKV has none
* ADHD hyperfocus

* Download a model (preconverted models pending)
* Convert the model (requires torch to pack tensors into raw binary)
* Download the tokenizer files
* Create a game in godot
* Distribute the game
* Profit

Example Code:

```python
extends Node2D
var zrkv = GodotRWKV.new()

# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready():
	zrkv.loadModel(""/path/to/model.bin"")
	zrkv.loadTokenizer(""/path/to/folder/with/vocab/"")
	zrkv.loadContext(""Hello, my name is Nathan, and I have been trying to reach you about your cars extended warrenty."")
# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func _process(delta):
	# number of tokens to generate, temperature, tau
	print(zrkv.forward(5,0.9,0.7))
```

* Windows support (Just needs some scons magic)
* AMD Support (Just needs some HIPify magic)
* CPU mode (Just needs some ggml)
* CPU offload (needs ggml and effort)

We have developed our own infrastructure to train massive models.

There's how it works:

1. You upload the dataset with preconfigured format into HuggingFaсe \[1\].
2. Choose your LLM (e.g. LLaMa 70B, Mistral 7B)
3. Place your submission into the queue
4. Wait for it to get trained.
5. Then you get your trained model there on HuggingFace.

Essentially, why would we want to do it?

1. We already have an experience with training big LLMs.
2. We could achieve near-perfect infrastructure performance for training.
3. Sometimes GPUs have just nothing to train.

Thus we thought it would be cool if  could give back to Open Source community (already built an e2e distributed training framework \[2\]).

This is in an early stage, so you can expect some bugs.

Any thoughts, opinions, or ideas are quite welcome!

53,machinelearning,llm,top,2023-12-22 10:54:20,[P] I tried to teach Mistral 7B a new language (Sundanese) and it worked!

I'll start by saying I am not a machine learning expert and I am new to this since getting into LLMs as it got popular since LLaMa release. So, I don't know much of the technicalities although I am willing to learn.

Seeing that even Bing chat which is powered by chatGPT-4 couldn't speak in Sundanese when asked, I thought of trying to teach Mistral-7B Sundanese using just QLora training. It surprisingly worked out pretty well for how little data I had to train it with.

Why Sundanese? Because I can speak it and it is a regional language in Indonesia that isn't used much if at all on the internet so there was basically almost no chance it was trained well on any of these LLM models coming out.

This is more of an exercise to see if a small open-source model like Mistral 7B can be trained to learn a new very obscure language that is apparently never there in the original dataset. More details on the dataset and training settings are in the huggingface model card. Please ask me if you have any questions. Also, I have no idea how I am supposed to name the version, but I just called this 1.0 because the 0.x versions are basically me trial and erroring burning up electricity and heating my place for quite a while.

The resulting model is actually surprisingly coherent and translates knowledge in English to Sundanese decently. Although it is a bit unstable in that sometimes it replies with incorrect information or irrelevant information, which is probably because of the limited dataset. Next steps are going to be to get more datasets to train on, maybe translating the alpaca dataset to Sundanese and training on that.

For the comparisons, I understand that almost no one here understands Sundanese so it's best if you copy paste these to google translate to see what it's saying if you're interested.

**Comparisons**

We can see that without the finetune the model just defaults to replying in Indonesian even though the character card is in Sundanese and says to only reply in Sundanese. This is probably because the model is trained on data that correlates that Sundanese is spoken in Indonesia where people speak Indonesian. It also definitely works best on answering random questions if you asked trivia questions that has a chance to be on Wikipedia.

I have finished training RWKV-4 7B (an attention-free RNN LLM) and it can match GPT-J (6B params) performance. **Maybe RNN is already all you need** :)

These are RWKV BF16 numbers. RWKV 3B is better than GPT-neo 2.7B on everything (smaller RWKV lags behind on LAMBADA). Note GPT-J is using rotary and thus quite better than GPT-neo, so I expect RWKV to surpass it when both are at 14B.

Previous discussion: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xfup9f/r\_rwkv4\_scaling\_rnn\_to\_7b\_params\_and\_beyond\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xfup9f/r_rwkv4_scaling_rnn_to_7b_params_and_beyond_with/)

RWKV has both RNN & GPT mode. The RNN mode is great for inference. The GPT mode is great for training. Both modes are faster than usual transformer and saves VRAM, because the self-attention mechanism is replaced by simpler (almost linear) formulas. Moreover the hidden state is tiny in the RNN mode and you can use it as an embedding of the whole context.

For instance, using exact string match as the evaluation metric for long-sequence targets may disguise compounding incremental improvements as emergence. Similar logic may apply for multi-step or arithmetic reasoning problems, where models are only scored on whether they get the final answer to a multi-step problem correct, without any credit given to partially correct solutions. However, the jump in final answer accuracy does not explain why the quality of intermediate steps suddenly emerges to above random, and using evaluation metrics that do not give partial credit are at best an incomplete explanation, because emergent abilities are still observed on many classification tasks (e.g., the tasks in Figure 2D–H).

Abstract:

>We posit that to achieve superhuman agents, future models require superhuman feedback in order to provide an adequate training signal. Current approaches commonly train reward models from human preferences, which may then be bottlenecked by human performance level, and secondly these separate frozen reward models cannot then learn to improve during LLM training. In this work, we study Self-Rewarding Language Models, where the language model itself is used via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting to provide its own rewards during training. We show that during Iterative DPO training that not only does instruction following ability improve, but also the ability to provide high-quality rewards to itself. Fine-tuning Llama 2 70B on three iterations of our approach yields a model that outperforms many existing systems on the AlpacaEval 2.0 leaderboard, including Claude 2, Gemini Pro, and GPT-4 0613. While only a preliminary study, this work opens the door to the possibility of models that can continually improve in both axes.

It's pretty well known that LLMs have solidified their place at the forefront of natural language processing, and are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible in terms of language understanding and generation.

The resulting model has 37% fewer errors than the same LLM fine-tuned on the noisy data.

It looks much better than existing state-of-the-art when you manually inspect examples, but it performs worse on academic benchmarks...

Unfortunately, this is common in the real world! Many academic evaluations have hidden flaws that render them misleading.

For example, here's a typical row from the HellaSwag benchmark, which presents a scenario and asks which continuation is most likely.

SCENARIO: **""Men are standing in a large green field playing lacrosse. People is around the field watching the game. Men""**

1. ""**are holding tshirts watching int lacrosse playing.**""
2. ""**are being interviewed in a podium in front of a large group and a gymnast is holding a microphone for the announcers.**""

4. ""**are in a field running around playing lacrosse.**""

I wanted to share with you [SimpleAI](https://github.com/lhenault/simpleAI), a self-hosted alternative to OpenAI API.

The aim of this project is to replicate the (main) endpoints of [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), and to let you easily and quickly plug in any new model. It basically allows you to deploy your custom model wherever you want and easily, while minimizing the amount of changes both on server and client sides.

It's compatible with the [OpenAI client](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) so you don't have to change much in your existing code (or can use it to easily query your API).

Wether you like or not the AI-as-a-service approach of OpenAI, I think that project could be of interest to many. Even if you are fully satisfied with a paid API, you might be interested in this if:

* You need a model fine tuned on some specific language and don't see any good alternative, or your company data is too sensitive to send it to an external service

* You’ve developped your own awesome model, and want a drop-in replacement to switch to yours, to be able to A/B test the two approaches.

* You're deploying your services in an infrastructure with an unreliable internet connection, so you would rather have your service locally

* You're just another AI enthusiast with a lot of spare time and free GPU

I've personally really enjoyed how open the ML(Ops) community has been in the past years, and seeing how the industry seems to be moving towards paid API and black box systems can be a bit worrying. This project might be useful to expose great, community-based alternatives.


If that sounds interesting, please have a look at the [examples](https://github.com/lhenault/simpleAI/tree/main/examples). I also have a [blogpost](https://louishenault.com/p/replicating-openai-api-for-llama-alpaca-or-any-animal-shaped-llm/) explaining a few more things.

**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04415](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04415)

**Abstract**: Weight decay is a broadly used technique for training state-of-the-art deep networks, including large language models. Despite its widespread usage, its role remains poorly understood. In this work, we highlight that the role of weight decay in modern deep learning is different from its regularization effect studied in classical learning theory. For overparameterized deep networks, we show how weight decay modifies the optimization dynamics enhancing the ever-present implicit regularization of SGD via the loss stabilization mechanism. In contrast, for underparameterized large language models trained with nearly online SGD, we describe how weight decay balances the bias-variance tradeoff in stochastic optimization leading to lower training loss. Moreover, we show that weight decay also prevents sudden loss divergences for bfloat16 mixed-precision training which is a crucial tool for LLM training. Overall, we present a unifying perspective from ResNets on vision tasks to LLMs: weight decay is never useful as an explicit regularizer but instead changes the training dynamics in a desirable way.

You might have come across the paper [Mamba paper](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba) in the last days, which was the first attempt at scaling up state space models to 2.8B parameters to work on language data.

Contrary to transformers, this kind of architecture's computational complexity does not scale quadratically with input length, so it would be awesome if it could replace transformers in the long term.  
We were super excited about this paper and the published model, but unfortunately, no training code was provided with it, so we've decided to write it and train a model ourselves. As a result of this, we've just released mamba-chat, which is probably **the best existing LLM that does not rely on transformers.** Honestly, I am super surprised by how well the model performs, given that it's only 2.8B parameters and the base model was only trained on the Pile. Quite exciting to think if these models might dethrone transformers at some point.

Feel free to check out our [Github](https://github.com/havenhq/mamba-chat) or [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/havenhq/mamba-chat) repository! Our Github repo includes a cli chat script, so you can easily run the model if you have access to a GPU."

# TL;DR

Recently, Google DeepMind showed that [LLMs cannot self-correct reasoning errors without external feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01798). We wanted to investigate this and set out to answer these questions:

1. Can LLMs *find* logical mistakes, regardless of their ability to correct them?
2. Can LLMs *correct* logical mistakes, regardless of their ability to find them?

What we found was:

1. No, LLMs are *really bad* at finding logical mistakes (10-50% accuracy)! This is probably why they cannot self-correct without external feedback.
2. Yes, LLMs can correct logical mistakes if they know where they are. We propose a new backtracking method to do this.

In the process, we also collected a dataset called **BIG-Bench Mistake.** It contains 2,186 sets of CoT steps, annotated with the location of the first logical error. You can find it on [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/WHGTyen/BIG-Bench-Mistake)."

>Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have led to high-quality LLMs with impressive abilities. By compressing such LLMs via quantization to 3-4 bits per parameter, they can fit into memory-limited devices such as laptops and mobile phones, enabling personalized use. However, quantization down to 3-4 bits per parameter usually leads to moderate-to-high accuracy losses, especially for smaller models in the 1-10B parameter range, which are well-suited for edge deployments.  
To address this accuracy issue, we introduce the Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new compressed format and quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless compression of LLMs across model scales, while reaching similar compression levels to previous methods. SpQR works by identifying and isolating outlier weights, which cause particularly-large quantization errors, and storing them in higher precision, while compressing all other weights to 3-4 bits, and achieves relative accuracy losses of less than 1% in perplexity for highly-accurate LLaMA and Falcon LLMs. This makes it possible to run 33B parameter LLM on a single 24 GB consumer GPU without any performance degradation at 15% speedup thus making powerful LLMs available to consumer without any downsides. SpQR comes with efficient algorithms for both encoding weights into its format, as well as decoding them efficiently at runtime. Specifically, we provide an efficient GPU inference algorithm for SpQR which yields faster inference than 16-bit baselines at similar accuracy, while enabling memory compression gains of more than 4x.

Throughout history, humans have dreamed of robots that could assist them with their daily lives and work. With the emergence of home assistants and OpenAI's Copilot, requests such as 'Please lower the temperature of the air conditioning' or even 'Please help me build an online store' have become possible.The emergence of GPT-4 has further demonstrated the potential of multimodal large models in visual understanding. In the open-source small model space, LLAVA and minigpt-4 have performed well in image recognition and chat, and can even suggest recipes for food images. However, these models still face significant challenges in practical implementation: they lack accurate localization capabilities and cannot provide specific locations of objects in images, nor can they understand complex human instructions to detect specific objects, making it difficult for them to perform specific tasks as requested by humans. In practical scenarios, if people could simply take a photo and ask an intelligent assistant for the correct answer to a complex problem, such a 'take a photo and ask' feature would be incredibly cool.  
To implement the ""**take a photo and ask**"" feature, robots need to have several capabilities:

1. Language understanding: the ability to listen and understand human intentions.
2. Visual understanding: the ability to understand the objects in the image.
3. Common sense reasoning: the ability to convert complex human intentions into precise and locatable targets.
4. Object localization: the ability to locate and detect corresponding objects in the image.

Currently, only a few large models (such as Google's PaLM-E) possess all four of these capabilities. However, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have proposed an open-source model called DetGPT (DetectionGPT), which only needs to fine-tune three million parameters to easily acquire complex reasoning and local object localization capabilities that can be generalized to most scenarios. This means that the model can easily recognize the objects that humans are interested in through self-knowledge reasoning and understand abstract human instructions. They have already developed a ""take a photo and ask"" demo using the model, which can be experienced online: [https://detgpt.github.io/](https://detgpt.github.io/)DetGPT allows users to operate everything with natural language without the need for complex commands or interfaces. In addition, DetGPT has intelligent reasoning and object detection capabilities, which can accurately understand user needs and intentions. For example, if a human gives a language instruction, ""I want to have a cold beverage,"" the robot first searches for a cold drink in the scene but does not find any. It then begins to think, ""There is no visible beverage. Where can I find it?"" Through its powerful common sense reasoning ability, the model realizes that the fridge is a possible location and scans the scene to successfully locate the drink!

## Features of DetGPT

DetGPT has several unique features:

1. It has a significantly improved understanding of specific objects in images. Compared to previous models that use multimodal dialogues, DetGPT can retrieve and locate target objects from images based on the user's instructions, rather than simply describing the entire image.
2. It can understand complex human instructions, which lowers the barrier for users to ask questions. For example, the model can understand the question ""find fruits that can relieve hypertension?"" Traditional object detection requires humans to know the answer and pre-set the detection category, such as ""banana.""
3. DetGPT can use existing LLM knowledge to reason and accurately locate the corresponding object in the image that can solve more complex tasks. For complex tasks, such as ""fruits that can relieve hypertension,"" DetGPT can reason step by step: relieving hypertension -> potassium can relieve hypertension -> bananas are rich in potassium -> bananas can relieve hypertension -> need to identify the object banana.
4. It provides answers beyond human common sense. For some uncommon questions, such as which fruits are rich in potassium, the model can provide answers based on existing knowledge.

## A new direction: reasoning-based object detection

Traditional object detection tasks require pre-defined categories of possible objects for detection. However, providing accurate and comprehensive descriptions of the objects to be detected can be difficult and unrealistic for humans. This is due to the limitations of human memory and knowledge. For instance, a doctor may recommend that people with hypertension eat fruits rich in potassium, but may not know which specific fruits are rich in potassium, making it impossible to provide specific fruit names for the model to detect. If the question ""Identify fruits that can help alleviate hypertension"" could be directly posed to the detection model, humans would only need to take a photo, and the model could think, reason, and detect fruits rich in potassium, making the problem much simpler.Moreover, the examples of object categories provided by humans are not always comprehensive. For instance, if monitoring is required to detect behaviors that violate public order relative to public places, humans may only be able to provide a few simple scenarios, such as holding a knife or smoking. However, if the question ""detect behaviors that violate public order"" is directly posed to the detection model, the model can think and reason based on its own knowledge, thus capturing more unacceptable behaviors and generalizing to more relevant categories that need to be detected. After all, the knowledge that ordinary humans have access to is limited, and the object categories that they can provide examples of are also limited. However, if there is a big brain-like ChatGPT-like model to assist and reason, the instructions that humans need to provide will be much simpler, and the obtained answers will be much more accurate and comprehensive.To address the limitations of human instructions and their abstract nature, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have proposed a new direction called ""reasoning-based object detection."" In simple terms, humans give complex tasks, and the model can understand and reason about which objects in the image might be able to complete the task, and then detect them. For example, if a person describes ""I want to drink a cold drink, where can I find it,"" and the model sees a picture of a kitchen, it can detect the ""refrigerator."" This topic requires the perfect combination of multimodal models' image understanding ability and the rich knowledge stored in language models. It is used in fine-grained detection scenarios to accurately locate objects of interest to humans in images without pre-defined object categories.  


# The Approach

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ho9ux1pcahza1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf42e1baffa2925e8b946b191766ca116aec2fe1

The ""reasoning-based object detection"" is a challenging problem because the detector needs to understand and reason about the user's coarse-grained/abstract instructions and analyze the current visual information to locate the target object accurately. In this direction, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the University of Hong Kong have conducted some preliminary explorations. Specifically, they use a pre-trained visual encoder (BLIP-2) to extract visual features from images and align the visual features to the text space using an alignment function. They use a large-scale language model (Robin/Vicuna) to understand the user's question, combined with the visual information they see, to reason about the objects that users are truly interested in. Then, they provide the object names to the pre-trained detector (Grounding-DINO) for specific location prediction. In this way, the model can analyze the image based on any user instructions and accurately predict the location of the object of interest to the user.  
It is worth noting that the difficulty here mainly lies in the fact that the model needs to achieve task-specific output formats for different specific tasks as much as possible without damaging the model's original abilities. To guide the language model to follow specific patterns and generate outputs that conform to the object detection format, the research team used ChatGPT to generate cross-modal instruction data to fine-tune the model. Specifically, based on 5000 coco images, they used ChatGPT to create a 30,000 cross-modal image-text fine-tuning dataset. To improve the efficiency of training, they fixed other model parameters and only learned cross-modal linear mapping. Experimental results show that even if only the linear layer is fine-tuned, the language model can understand fine-grained image features and follow specific patterns to perform inference-based image detection tasks, showing excellent performance.  
This research topic has great potential. Based on this technology, the field of home robots will further shine: people in homes can use abstract or coarse-grained voice instructions to make robots understand, recognize, and locate the objects they need, and provide relevant services. In the field of industrial robots, this technology will bring endless vitality: industrial robots can cooperate more naturally with human workers, accurately understand their instructions and needs, and achieve intelligent decision-making and operations. On the production line, human workers can use coarse-grained voice instructions or text input to allow robots to automatically understand, recognize, and locate the items that need to be processed, thereby improving production efficiency and quality.  
With object detection models that come with reasoning capabilities, we can develop more intelligent, natural, and efficient robots to provide more convenient, efficient, and humane services to humans. This is a field with broad prospects and deserves more attention and further exploration by more researchers.  
DetGPT supports multiple language models and has been validated based on two language models, Robin-13B and Vicuna-13B. The Robin series language model is a dialogue model trained by the LMFlow team ( https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, achieving results competitive to Vicuna on multiple language ability evaluation benchmarks (model download: [https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow#model-zoo](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow#model-zoo)). Previously, the LMFlow team trained a vertical GPT model using a consumer-grade 3090 graphics card in just 5 hours. Today, this team, in collaboration with the NLP Group at the University of Hong Kong, has brought us a multimodal surprise.

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1703961405999759638) shows the style of prompts that are being used to get these results with the new language model.

I used website parrotchess\[dot\]com (discovered [here](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1704179448013070560)) to play multiple games of chess purportedly pitting this new language model vs. various levels at website Lichess, which supposedly uses Fairy-Stockfish 14 according to the Lichess user interface. My current results for all completed games: The language model is 5-0 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/eGSWJtNq), [game 2](https://lichess.org/pN7K9bdS), [game 3](https://lichess.org/aK4jQvdo), [game 4](https://lichess.org/S9SGg8YI), [game 5](https://lichess.org/OqzdkDhE)), and 2-5 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 6 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/zP68C6H4), [game 2](https://lichess.org/4XKUIDh1), [game 3](https://lichess.org/1zTasRRp), [game 4](https://lichess.org/lH1EMqJQ), [game 5](https://lichess.org/mdFlTbMn), [game 6](https://lichess.org/HqmELNhw), [game 7](https://lichess.org/inWVs05Q)). Not included in the tally are games that I had to abort because the parrotchess user interface stalled (5 instances), because I accidentally copied a move incorrectly in the parrotchess user interface (numerous instances), or because the parrotchess user interface doesn't allow the promotion of a pawn to anything other than queen (1 instance). **Update: There could have been up to 5 additional losses - the number of times the parrotchess user interface stalled - that would have been recorded in this tally if** [this language model resignation bug](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1705894692603269503) **hadn't been present. Also, the quality of play of some online chess bots can perhaps vary depending on the speed of the user's hardware.**

The following is a screenshot from parrotchess showing the end state of the first game vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5:

The game results in this paragraph are from using parrotchess after the forementioned resignation bug was fixed. The language model is 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish level 7 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/Se3t7syX)), and 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 8 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/j3W2OwrP)).

There are several other ways to play chess against the new language model if you have access to the OpenAI API. The first way is to use the OpenAI Playground as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CReHXhmMprg).

From blog post [Playing chess with large language models](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2023/chess-llm.html):

>Computers have been better than humans at chess for at least the last 25 years. And for the past five years, deep learning models have been better than the best humans. But until this week, in order to be good at chess, a machine learning model had to be explicitly designed to play games: it had to be told explicitly that there was an 8x8 board, that there were different pieces, how each of them moved, and what the goal of the game was. Then it had to be trained with reinforcement learning agaist itself. And then it would win.  
>  
>This all changed on Monday, when OpenAI released GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct, an instruction-tuned language model that was designed to just write English text, but that people on the internet quickly discovered can play chess at, roughly, the level of skilled human players.

Post [Chess as a case study in hidden capabilities in ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6vH6fr8ngo7csDdf/chess-as-a-case-study-in-hidden-capabilities-in-chatgpt) from last month covers a different prompting style used for the older chat-based GPT 3.5 Turbo language model. If I recall correctly from my tests with ChatGPT-3.5, using that prompt style with the older language model can defeat Stockfish level 2 at Lichess, but I haven't been successful in using it to beat Stockfish level 3. In my tests, both the quality of play and frequency of illegal attempted moves seems to be better with the new prompt style with the new language model compared to the older prompt style with the older language model.

P.S. Since some people claim that language model gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is always playing moves memorized from the training dataset, I searched for data on the uniqueness of chess positions. From [this video](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2225), we see that for a certain game dataset there were 763,331,945 chess positions encountered in an unknown number of games without removing duplicate chess positions, 597,725,848 different chess positions reached, and 582,337,984 different chess positions that were reached only once. Therefore, for that game dataset the probability that a chess position in a game was reached only once is 582337984 / 763331945 = 76.3%. For the larger dataset [cited](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2187) in that video, there are approximately (506,000,000 - 200,000) games in the dataset (per [this paper](http://tom7.org/chess/survival.pdf)), and 21,553,382,902 different game positions encountered. Each game in the larger dataset added a mean of approximately 21,553,382,902 / (506,000,000 - 200,000) = 42.6 different chess positions to the dataset. For [this different dataset](https://lichess.org/blog/Vs0xMTAAAD4We4Ey/opening-explorer) of \~12 million games, \~390 million different chess positions were encountered. Each game in this different dataset added a mean of approximately (390 million / 12 million) = 32.5 different chess positions to the dataset. From the aforementioned numbers, we can conclude that a strategy of playing only moves memorized from a game dataset would fare poorly because there are not rarely new chess games that have chess positions that are not present in the game dataset."

While our current implementation leverages the power of GPT-3.5 (already a huge reduction from GPT-4 alternative), we recognise the need for cost-effective solutions without compromising functionality. Our ongoing efforts involve exploring and harnessing the potential of smaller models like Vicuna 13B, ensuring that task automation remains accessible to a wider audience.

So this all started with me wanting to talk to my local Alpaca bot from the bar to show my friend something. He’s a mobile developer and also recently unemployed like me, so the stars aligned and we built this thing over the last few weeks. 

Friendly AI is an app that is compatible with the [BaseBot](https://github.com/sergeybok/BaseBot) python library that we built. We are basically open sourcing the message protocol that it uses so that you can build your own “backend” for it that does whatever you want! I recently built myself a bot that allows me to write and run commands, shell scripts, and even python from my phone. Very handy when you went to the bar and forgot to commit and push your code. 

[Apple app is available](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friendly-ai/id6447589849). The android app is currently in review so hopefully comes out later today.

If you are using Mac/Ubuntu the Quickstart command from the GitHub Readme should set you up with a starter project. If you either already have openai key on your system, or you create one and provide it on install, it will start you off with a simple ChatGPT wrapper (like the one that comes with the app if you Sign Up). 

If you are on windows I’m sorry neither of us has one so we couldn’t create an install script. However if you pip install the library and read the Readme you should be fine. 

Furthermore because it’s self-hosted, you can be sure that your data stays private. It’s stored on your own machine (in mongodb if you have it setup, in json files if you don’t). When you message your bots from the app the message data is sent directly to your bot and nowhere else. 

I think here of all places people will make good use of this tech. Because personally since I don’t have millions of dollars and can’t be actually working on proper LLM research by myself (which is what I’d rather be doing tbh), at least I can build cool stuff that uses the already existing models. 

The signup stuff isn’t necessary, the only reason why we built it is just to be able to limit people’s use of our bots, while also providing some access to them since without any bots you can’t try out the app. But we want people to build their own bots, and not simply use ours!

My hope was that it would remove a lot of the annoying parts of building bots and let people (including myself) concentrate on the actual interesting / ML /etc. parts of the problem — namely what the bot actually does in response to user prompts! And of course, the response doesn't actually have to use any LLMs (e.g. you can hook up your local stable diffusion model), or ML in general (as I said earlier I made a bot that simply executes the shell commands i give it). 

PS. Our servers are basically free-tier so in the off-chance that there’s a lot of downloads they might not hold up. But even if our servers are completely down that affects only our bots, you can still talk with your own bots!"

Everywhere I look today (medium, reddit, twitter) everyone is talking about fine-tuning LLMs. How the future is taking billion size models and fine-tuning/distilling them to specialised LLMs that perform specific tasks (i.e: sentiment analysis, Q&A, summarisation).

Why not just use “small” (millions vs billion size) models that are specifically fine-tuned for these final tasks instead? Any benchmarks on how LLMs perform on these down stream tasks ? or it's just that smaller models are not as accessible as an OpenAPI is ?

GPT 3.5 provided the best answers, but FastChat-T5 was very close in performance (with a basic guardrail). The T5 models I tested are all licensed under Apache 2.0, so they are commercially viable.

For the embedding model, I compared OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 and the open source INSTRUCTOR-XL models. The INSTRUCTOR-XL model performed better, which is encouraging since INSTRUCTOR-XL is also licensed under Apache 2.0.

This outline is a roadmap on how to learn state-of-the-art stuff about Large Language Models. It builds on work that I have done at AT&T and Toyota. It also builds on a lot of work that I have done on my own outside of corporations. 

The outline is solid, and as my way of giving back to the community, I am it giving away for free. That's right, no annoying email sign-up. No gimmicks. No stripe pages for a ""free trial."" No asking you to buy a timeshare in Florida at the end of the outline. It's just a link to a zip file which contains the outline and sample code. 

Here is how it works. First, you need to know Python. If you don't know that, then look up how to learn Python on Google. Second, this is an outline, you need to look at each part, go through the links, and really digest the material before moving on. Third, every part of the outline is dense; there is no fluff, and you will will probably need to do multiple passes through the outline.

The outline is designed to start you with an approach to learning Pytorch, it gives a code example of how to do classifications with sentence embeddings, and it also has another code example of how to run Zephyr in colab. The outline took me a couple of days to put together, but it really represents stuff from the past year.

Also, this is not an outline on fine tuning Language Models. It is not a discussion of Mistral MoE, and it is not a discussion of running mutliple GPUs. It is designed for someone who has a laptop and wants to learn.

Also, think of this outline as a gift. It is being provided without warranty, or any guarantee of any kind.  

If you like the outline, I am begging you to hit that share button and share this with someone. Maybe it will help them as well. If you love the outline, take this as motivation to do good in the world and share something you have done with the community.

Title: Can It Edit? Evaluating the Ability of Large Language Models to Follow Code Editing Instructions

Code repository: [https://github.com/nuprl/CanItEdit](https://github.com/nuprl/CanItEdit)

Abstract:

>A significant amount of research is focused on developing and evaluating large language models for a variety of code synthesis tasks. These include synthesizing code from natural language instructions, synthesizing tests from code, and synthesizing explanations of code. In contrast, the behavior of instructional code editing with LLMs is understudied. These are tasks in which the model is instructed to update a block of code provided in a prompt. The editing instruction may ask for a feature to added or removed, describe a bug and ask for a fix, ask for a different kind of solution, or many other common code editing tasks. We introduce a carefully crafted benchmark of code editing tasks and use it evaluate several cutting edge LLMs. Our evaluation exposes a significant gap between the capabilities of state-of-the-art open and closed models. For example, even GPT-3.5-Turbo is 8.8% better than the best open model at editing code. We also introduce a new, carefully curated, permissively licensed training set of code edits coupled with natural language instructions. Using this training set, we show that we can fine-tune open Code LLMs to significantly improve their code editing capabilities.

Discussion:

I'm sharing this paper to start a discussion. Disclaimer: this paper comes from our research group, but not trying to do self-promotion here. We are seeing that open source Code LLMs are slowly getting closer and closer to GPT-4 performance when evaluated on program synthesis and surpassing GPT-3.5-turbo (see DeepSeek Coder: [https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder)) when using common benchmarks, such as HumanEval, MBPP, and \*new\* LeetCode problems (this is to minimize contamination).

However, this isn't the modality you may want. Often, the need is to modify a section of code with accompanying natural language instructions (for example, Cursor IDE has shifted away from the GitHub Copilot style to focus solely on code editing: [https://cursor.sh/features](https://cursor.sh/features)). Also, simple code generation, achievable by models trained on code editing, might be considered a subset of code editing, by prompting the model with a blank before window.

In our various research projects, we've seen Code LLMs struggle with code editing. So we did the obvious thing, we examined how these models perform in this specific task. Surprisingly, models excelling in simple synthesis fall short in code editing compared to even just GPT-3.5-turbo.

Why is this the case? While some suggest data contamination, I doubt that's the primary factor, given these models' effectiveness on fresh and unseen benchmarks. Could it be that OpenAI dedicated a specific data subset for tasks like code or language editing (model then generalized to code)?

UPDATE:

After receiving criticism for not including models larger than 33b in our evaluations, I decided to eval Tulu 2 DPO 70b, which is reportedly the state-of-the-art 70b instruct-tuned LLM according to the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard (see: [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard)). I also evaluated Mixtral Instruct 0.1.

As I expected, both models didn't perform impressively, likely due to insufficient training on code. It's reasonable to assume that a 70b model specifically trained on code would yield better results.  Tulu's performance is slightly inferior to CodeLlama-33b-chat and not on par with DeepSeek Coder, and far from GPT-3.5-Turbo.

|Model|Descriptive Pass@1 (ExcessCode)|Lazy Pass@1 (ExcessCode)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tulu-2-DPO-70b|33.26 (1.41)|26.42 (1.58)|

Abstract:

>Despite recent success in large language model (LLM) reasoning, **LLMs struggle with hierarchical multi-step reasoning tasks like generating complex programs.** For these tasks, **humans often start with a high-level algorithmic design and implement each part gradually.** We introduce Parsel, a framework enabling automatic implementation and validation of complex algorithms with code LLMs, taking hierarchical function descriptions in natural language as input. We show that **Parsel can be used across domains requiring hierarchical reasoning, including program synthesis, robotic planning, and theorem proving.** We show that LLMs generating Parsel solve more competition-level problems in the APPS dataset, resulting in **pass rates that are over 75% higher than prior results from directly sampling AlphaCode and Codex**, while often using a smaller sample budget. We also find that LLM-generated **robotic plans using Parsel as an intermediate language are more than twice as likely to be considered accurate than directly generated plans.** Lastly, we explore how Parsel addresses LLM limitations and discuss how Parsel may be useful for human programmers.

100,machinelearning,llm,comments,2023-03-22 08:04:01,[D] Overwhelmed by fast advances in recent weeks,iamx9000again,False,0.96,831,11ybjsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11ybjsi/d_overwhelmed_by_fast_advances_in_recent_weeks/,331,1679472241.0,"I was watching the GTC keynote and became entirely overwhelmed by the amount of progress achieved from last year.  I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1703961405999759638) shows the style of prompts that are being used to get these results with the new language model.

I used website parrotchess\[dot\]com (discovered [here](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1704179448013070560)) to play multiple games of chess purportedly pitting this new language model vs. various levels at website Lichess, which supposedly uses Fairy-Stockfish 14 according to the Lichess user interface. My current results for all completed games: The language model is 5-0 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/eGSWJtNq), [game 2](https://lichess.org/pN7K9bdS), [game 3](https://lichess.org/aK4jQvdo), [game 4](https://lichess.org/S9SGg8YI), [game 5](https://lichess.org/OqzdkDhE)), and 2-5 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 6 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/zP68C6H4), [game 2](https://lichess.org/4XKUIDh1), [game 3](https://lichess.org/1zTasRRp), [game 4](https://lichess.org/lH1EMqJQ), [game 5](https://lichess.org/mdFlTbMn), [game 6](https://lichess.org/HqmELNhw), [game 7](https://lichess.org/inWVs05Q)). Not included in the tally are games that I had to abort because the parrotchess user interface stalled (5 instances), because I accidentally copied a move incorrectly in the parrotchess user interface (numerous instances), or because the parrotchess user interface doesn't allow the promotion of a pawn to anything other than queen (1 instance). **Update: There could have been up to 5 additional losses - the number of times the parrotchess user interface stalled - that would have been recorded in this tally if** [this language model resignation bug](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1705894692603269503) **hadn't been present. Also, the quality of play of some online chess bots can perhaps vary depending on the speed of the user's hardware.**

The following is a screenshot from parrotchess showing the end state of the first game vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5:

The game results in this paragraph are from using parrotchess after the forementioned resignation bug was fixed. The language model is 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish level 7 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/Se3t7syX)), and 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 8 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/j3W2OwrP)).

There is [one known scenario](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1706823943305167077) ([Nitter alternative](https://nitter.net/OwariDa/status/1706823943305167077)) in which the new language model purportedly generated an illegal move using language model sampling temperature of 0. Previous purported illegal moves that the parrotchess developer examined [turned out](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1706765203130515642) ([Nitter alternative](https://nitter.net/OwariDa/status/1706765203130515642)) to be due to parrotchess bugs.

There are several other ways to play chess against the new language model if you have access to the OpenAI API. The first way is to use the OpenAI Playground as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CReHXhmMprg). The second way is chess web app gptchess\[dot\]vercel\[dot\]app (discovered in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/willdepue/status/1703974001717154191) / [Nitter thread](https://nitter.net/willdepue/status/1703974001717154191)). Third, another person modified that chess web app to additionally allow various levels of the Stockfish chess engine to autoplay, resulting in chess web app chessgpt-stockfish\[dot\]vercel\[dot\]app (discovered in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/paul_cal/status/1704466755110793455)).

From blog post [Playing chess with large language models](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2023/chess-llm.html):

>Computers have been better than humans at chess for at least the last 25 years. And for the past five years, deep learning models have been better than the best humans. But until this week, in order to be good at chess, a machine learning model had to be explicitly designed to play games: it had to be told explicitly that there was an 8x8 board, that there were different pieces, how each of them moved, and what the goal of the game was. Then it had to be trained with reinforcement learning agaist itself. And then it would win.  
>  
>This all changed on Monday, when OpenAI released GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct, an instruction-tuned language model that was designed to just write English text, but that people on the internet quickly discovered can play chess at, roughly, the level of skilled human players.

Post [Chess as a case study in hidden capabilities in ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6vH6fr8ngo7csDdf/chess-as-a-case-study-in-hidden-capabilities-in-chatgpt) from last month covers a different prompting style used for the older chat-based GPT 3.5 Turbo language model. If I recall correctly from my tests with ChatGPT-3.5, using that prompt style with the older language model can defeat Stockfish level 2 at Lichess, but I haven't been successful in using it to beat Stockfish level 3. In my tests, both the quality of play and frequency of illegal attempted moves seems to be better with the new prompt style with the new language model compared to the older prompt style with the older language model.

P.S. Since some people claim that language model gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is always playing moves memorized from the training dataset, I searched for data on the uniqueness of chess positions. From [this video](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2225), we see that for a certain game dataset there were 763,331,945 chess positions encountered in an unknown number of games without removing duplicate chess positions, 597,725,848 different chess positions reached, and 582,337,984 different chess positions that were reached only once. Therefore, for that game dataset the probability that a chess position in a game was reached only once is 582337984 / 763331945 = 76.3%. For the larger dataset [cited](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2187) in that video, there are approximately (506,000,000 - 200,000) games in the dataset (per [this paper](http://tom7.org/chess/survival.pdf)), and 21,553,382,902 different game positions encountered. Each game in the larger dataset added a mean of approximately 21,553,382,902 / (506,000,000 - 200,000) = 42.6 different chess positions to the dataset. For [this different dataset](https://lichess.org/blog/Vs0xMTAAAD4We4Ey/opening-explorer) of \~12 million games, \~390 million different chess positions were encountered. Each game in this different dataset added a mean of approximately (390 million / 12 million) = 32.5 different chess positions to the dataset. From the aforementioned numbers, we can conclude that a strategy of playing only moves memorized from a game dataset would fare poorly because there are not rarely new chess games that have chess positions that are not present in the game dataset."

Are open-source LLMs gonna be the future? Considering the trust issues with ChatGPT and the debates about its safety, the idea of open-source LLMs seems to be the best bet imo.

Unlike closed-source models, users can verify the privacy claims of open-source models. There have been some good things being said about Mistral, and I only hope such open source LLMs secure enough funding to compete with giants like OpenAI. Maybe then, ChatGPT will also be forced to go open source?

With that said, I'm also hopeful that competitors like [Silatus](https://silatus.com/) and [Durable](https://durable.co/), which already use multiple models, consider using open-source models like Mistral into their frameworks. If that happens, maybe there might be a shift in AI privacy. What do you guys think? Are open-source LLMs the future, especially with the funding backing them?"

Suggesting this topic for discussion, as I am trying to identify the current most important unsolved problems in AI research. Below are a few proposed items that are top of mind for me, would appreciate any input (what to add or what to remove from the list) and relevant sources.

---

Compositionality*. Ability to perform symbolic operations, generalize, including learning from a relatively small set of samples, and get the most out of every sample (sample efficiency and few-shot learning), etc. Also includes the ability to learn by receiving explicit instructions. (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01128)

Multimodality*. Ability to process and relate information from multiple modalities, like text, audio, visual, etc.

Ability to match knowledge to context. For e.g. the text generated by the LLM is a great match for a sci-fi novel, but not as advice to a patient regarding their medical condition.

Uncertainty awareness*. Ability to characterize uncertainty relative to the similarity of the current observations to the training data, explain it to an observer, and adjust behavior if necessary. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07882.pdf)

Catastrophic forgetting. It is a known limitation to continual learning, however, it seems like the large-scale models show an indication of robustness. (http://www.cognitionresearch.org/papers/overview/sparchai.pdf)

Enabling robust continuous learning in deployment. The current paradigm separates training and inference, while in biology intelligent creatures are capable of continuous learning. 

Figuring out an approach for the messy middle.
- Low-level operations with a focus on a very narrow scope and maximum efficiency seem reasonably straightforward and enjoy growing application in the industry. Noise removing, pattern recognition, recommenders, etc. Specialized ANNs seem to have success there.
- High-level abstract reasoning is being explored by large language and multi-modal models. Like our explicit reasoning (solving a math problem, or learning to operate a new coffee machine) it is extremely powerful, but also slow and resource-intensive. (E.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05608)
- But there is that middle, as in driving, where we still do fairly complex operations with very high reliability, precision, and responsiveness, all with low cognitive load (figuratively “on autopilot”). 

Explainability* - enabling human experts to understand the underlying factors of why an AI decision has been made.
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-04083-2_2

Alignment* - ensuring that AI is properly aligned with human values. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-020-09539-2

Energy efficiency. The human brain is believed to consume tens of W of power (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.172399499) while less capable LLMs like GPT-3 require several kW (estimated as the power consumption of DGX A100 based on https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/inp025/if_you_want_to_run_your_own_full_gpt3_instance/).

However, the jump in final answer accuracy does not explain why the quality of intermediate steps suddenly emerges to above random, and using evaluation metrics that do not give partial credit are at best an incomplete explanation, because emergent abilities are still observed on many classification tasks (e.g., the tasks in Figure 2D–H).

# The general intelligence factor in humans

In the early 1900s, Charles Spearman observed that children's performance across diverse school subjects was positively correlated (pictured below). He proposed the concept of a ""general intelligence factor,"" or *g*, to account for this correlation. This is why factor analysis was invented, it was invented by Spearman to quantify *g*.

&#x200B;

[The OG correlation matrix of school subjects](https://preview.redd.it/ohzhx16h6sub1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e0dd8e7b33571618cc2aa3399edabfbd873c12)

A century of research later, *g* has proven to be a robust and reliable construct. The positive correlations between various mental abilities, known as the positive manifold, have become one of the most replicated findings in differential psychology. The *g* factor typically accounts for over 40% of the variance in cognitive ability tests and serves as a strong predictor for various life outcomes.

While Spearman's original two-factor model suggested that intelligence comprises a general factor *g* and specific factors *s* unique to each test, contemporary research has refined this view. Current consensus holds that *g* sits atop a hierarchical model akin to the one shown below, underpinned by several first-order factors.

https://preview.redd.it/9cheo29n6sub1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2eadc486f9727933b24d9f808c3f7effc1b5fd0

# The general intelligence factor in non-human animals

The notion of general intelligence in non-human animals has been a subject of interest since the 1930, shortly after Spearman's concept gained traction. Empirical evidence suggests that *g* is not exclusive to humans. For instance, in rodents like mice, a *g* factor accounts for approximately 35% of the variance in cognitive performance. In a comprehensive meta-analysis covering non-human primates, a single factor explained 47% of the variance across 62 species, indicating a *g* factor similar to that in humans. Even in some bird species, such as bowerbirds, *g* explains over 44% of the variance in cognitive abilities.

However, it's worth noting that *g* may not be universal across all species. For example, evidence suggests that fish may not possess a *g* factor. Despite limitations like low sample size or limited task diversity in research on non-human animals, these findings indicate that *g* is not unique to humans and can sometimes be observed in various non-human species.

# Does g exist in language models?

I suspected *g* might exist in language models and prove itself to be both a powerful explanatory variable and an invaluable tool for measuring LLM ability.

To test for it's existence, I analyzed 1,232 models from the Open LLM Leaderboard and 88 models from the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) Leaderboard. A variety of cognitive subtests were used to assess the models, including ARC Challenge, Hellaswag,  TruthfulQA, MMLU subtests seen in the images below. Factor analysis techniques, specifically principal axis factoring, were employed to extract *g* from the performance data.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oz2yb78x6sub1.png?width=1103&format=png&auto=webp&s=92a853321e015fe17ba89637e0c3c3bf9d71cd14

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9q0an7k07sub1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=e18f216e1b880117a819ca17cda038d66889dcf9

As can be seen, correlations are uniformly positive (and extremely high) between all subtests, showing the existence of a ""positive manifold"". The average correlation in the matrices is .84, exactly the same for both datasets.

There was agreement for all statistical tests across both datasets that a single factor should be extracted (with only a single exception which was dismissed, as discussed in detail in the paper).

After factor analysis was performed, *g* loadings for subtests were obtained. Loosely speaking, the *g* loading is a correlation between *g* and the specific subtest.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m9xuj5c97sub1.png?width=435&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aad5fdaa2dbfa015fb317004c4d6af1dfc163bd

For the sake of brevity I won't post the subtest loading table for GLUE, but that's in the original paper as well. In there, loadings are .78 to .97 approximately.

Now here is an example of how we can rank models according to their general ability:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hrrbvwkg7sub1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=9afa927a7f0674a8946c6b6f5beaae9d1bb63099

In conclusion, both datasets showed an existence of *g* in language models. We now have a new unified method of ranking models based on how generally capable they are across tasks.

# How ""strong"" is g in language models?

About twice as strong as in humans and some animals.

The *g* factor in language models explains 85% of the variance on all tasks, in contrast to roughly 40% for humans and some animals. The number 85% is exactly replicated in both datasets.

The subtask *g* loading averages about .92, significantly higher than about .6 for humans.

# How reliable is g in language models?

After confirming that *g* is reliable across populations (i.e. it exists in both datasets), the study also included reliability analyses to assess the stability of *g* across test batteries and methods of extraction. In short, I wanted to see if we are actually measuring the same thing when we extract *g* from the same language models tested on 2 completely different test batteries.

I'll spare you the details on this one, but the correlation between *g* extracted from disjoint test batteries is basically 1. Same goes for different methods of extraction of *g*, like using PCA instead of FA. The *g* factor is therefore unique and highly reliable.

# Correlation between model size and g

Finally, the relationship between model size and *g* was explored. In short, the correlation was found to be r = .48 (p < .0001; 95% CI \[.44, .52\]). So, there exists a moderate/strong positive relationship between model size and *g*.

# Implications & Future Research

The identification of *g* in language models firstly allows us to measure what we actually want to measure (and compare) in language models, that is general ability. It allows the whole field to have a unified metric that can be used whenever we care more about general ability than some specific ability (like virology knowledge), which is almost always the case.

Another benefit of using *g* as the primary measure of ability in language models is that it prevents researchers fiddling with the administered test(s) until you find the specific test which seems to show that your model is better than the rest. It standardizes ability measurements in LLMs.

Plus, even if your improvement in a specific ability is real and not HARKed / p-hacked to death, it may still be just that, an improvement in specific abilities that don't affect general intelligence at all. This is obviously important to know when an improvement is discussed, and *g* is the measure that can tell us which is it. As an example of specific non-*g* improvements in humans, look up ""Flynn effect"".

I'd argue there's a big resource efficiency gain too, because now you can evaluate your model on a few carefully chosen *g*\-loaded subtests, derive *g* and infer the model's performance on all other tasks instead of testing your model on 200 tests each with 50+ items (like BigBench does, for example).

Apart from that, this method also allows for an objective ranking of various tests based on their *g* loading, which in turn provides a standardized measure of test relevance for specific populations of language models.

As for future research, there's tons of things to do. I'm personally interested in confirming the factor structure of general intelligence in LLMs or seeing impact of fine-tuning and RLHF on *g*. One can also examine which variables other than model size explain variance in *g* or how general ability and social bias correlate. I'd have loved to do these things, and it wouldn't even be hard, but I couldn't because of resource constraints. If you're looking for a paper idea, feel free to continue where I left off.

# Summary / Abstract

This study uncovers the factor of general intelligence, or *g*, in language models, extending the psychometric theory traditionally applied to humans and certain animal species. Utilizing factor analysis on two extensive datasets—Open LLM Leaderboard with 1,232 models and General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) Leaderboard with 88 models—we find compelling evidence for a unidimensional, highly stable *g* factor that accounts for 85% of the variance in model performance. The study also finds a moderate correlation of .48 between model size and *g*. The discovery of the general intelligence factor in language models offers a unified metric for model evaluation and opens new avenues for more robust, *g*\-based model ability assessment. These findings lay the foundation for understanding and future research on artificial general intelligence from a psychometric perspective and have practical implications for model evaluation and development.

The command format  used in this example was designed to mimic the syntax of systems like autogpt. For context, autogpt and similar apps look for JSON commands which are then passed to methods to invoke server-side code.

The goal is to show that a user can bury malicious prompts inside of text. If the prompt is sufficiently convincing, GPT will do what it says instead of follow the original task. *An attack like this could be used to execute any command the bot is capable of.*

Consider the case of LLMs tasked to scrape internet data or read databases. Just one malicious prompt could corrupt the entire process. Since the bot understands natural language, almost any user could attempt an attack like this."

It's great to have a way to break out of my own insular research bubble and spread out a bit more. Unfortunately, it looks like that era has passed.

The sub has been seemingly shifting away from research in the past 1-2 years. Whenever research is posted, it is almost always LLM based with very little variety (considering the plethora of research areas in ML). I don't mean to assert that this is a bad thing, as the constant upvotes indicate that there is a high demand for LLM projects and research. Heck, I'm also interested in lots of the recent work with LLMs, and I plan to keep up with it – but I also would also love a venue with a diversity of ideas and topics. Machine learning is a HUGE field, and only focusing on a small subset of it seems like a waste.

I don't mean to rant, but rather to ask: are there any other subreddits like this, or perhaps, any other active communities with a broader scope?

Or if this doesn't exist, is there a demand for it? Or is it just me?"

LLMs work by embedding tokens into vectors, where each dimension represents a different aspect of potential meaning. For example, one dimension might be a scalar of how edible something is: pork might get a score of 5, grass 2, steel: 0. Each vector gets transformed into a key, a query, and a value using weight matrices that modify the original vector in different ways to accentuate different features(relevance seeking features for the query, relevance determine features for the key, identity features for the value). The query of each token in a prompt is multiplied by the key of every token in the prompt, including itself, which functions to determine to relevance of each token to every other token in the prompt (for example the edibility of pork, 5, multiplied by the edibility of steel, 0, is 0, showing there is no relevance with regards to edibility between the query of pork and the key of steel). Each of the resulting dot products, called attentional-score vectors, gets normalized via a softmax function, giving us a probability distribution of attention for each query. These probabilities are then multiplied by the values of each token in the prompt, and their resultant vectors are summed to provide a contextually enriched vector for each token in the prompt, called an output vector. This output vector then gets transformed through several different layers of neurons until it comes to an output which is its prediction of the next token. That prediction gets compared to the actual next token, and via backpropogation (essentially using the chain rule) it is determined the gradient of the loss function of the models output, and optimization algorithms then adjust the weights of the transformers so they more closely reflect the actual next token. 

Ok, so why then do I say LLMs are not artificial intelligence - because they’re not, not by any definition of intelligence that I’ve come across. Intelligence is the ability of a mind to solve a certain problem or reach a certain goal. What LLMs do is not intelligence but perception. We have developed artificial perception (please don’t mistake that for consciousness), not intelligence. If an LLM had goals which it used its perception to achieve, then I would consider it AI, but for now, it just predicts the next token. Not to say that’s not impressive, you need perception in order to have intelligence, but perception alone is not intelligence, as much as intelligence is based on it. 

Humans also do what I imagine is next-frame prediction. It’s been established that our brains don’t use the chain rule to determine the loss gradient of our transformations of neural data, but it’s well known that the brain does use transformers (neurons that perform mathematical operations on the data of other neurons). Likely, there is some other way of doing this which we haven’t discovered yet. But human behavior isn’t the product of perception, which is formed in the posterior parts of our brains (PTO-junction) it comes from cognition, which is formed in the limbic and frontal parts of our brain (basal ganglia and PFC), where our motivations direct our will which controls our attention which controls our thoughts and behavior.

So, I don’t think we’ll have artificial intelligence until somebody decides to build a model that has goals and the ability to direct attention to influence thoughts and behavior based on perception. We have the perception bit, all we need is attention (see what I did there)."

I get to plot a histogram with the numbers and they are close to what I would consider an exponential distribution with such parameter (you can see the plot).

Given that GPT 3.5 does not have access to a Python interpreter, how on earth is it able to do so? I have also tried other distributions and parameters and it kind of works. It's not perfect, but with normal distributions it is usually close to what scipy.stats would generate.

I could understand that it can have learnt to interpret Python code to some extent, but honestly I can't find explanation for random sampling from a probability distribution. For a Normal distribution, I can tell it about the desired mean and variance, and it samples values that are more than reasonable (and close to the true mean/variance specified).

Any thoughts? I honestly am unable to wrap my head around how a LLM can have the understanding on how to sample tokens (at digit level) to fit any probability distribution. To me it seems very unlikely to have similar data either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages."

**Juergen Schmidhuber, Renowned 'Father Of Modern AI,' Says His Life’s Work Won't Lead To Dystopia**

*May 23, 2023. Contributed by [Hessie Jones](https://twitter.com/hessiejones).*

Amid the growing concern about the impact of more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on society, there are many in the technology community who fear the implications of the advancements in Generative AI if they go unchecked. Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber, a renowned scientist, artificial intelligence researcher and widely regarded as one of the pioneers in the field, is more optimistic. He declares that many of those who suddenly warn against the dangers of AI are just seeking publicity, exploiting the media’s obsession with killer robots which has attracted more attention than “good AI” for healthcare etc.

The potential to revolutionize various industries and improve our lives is clear, as are the equal dangers if bad actors leverage the technology for personal gain. Are we headed towards a dystopian future, or is there reason to be optimistic? I had a chance to sit down with Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber to understand his perspective on this seemingly fast-moving AI-train that will leap us into the future.

As a teenager in the 1970s, Juergen Schmidhuber became fascinated with the idea of creating intelligent machines that could learn and improve on their own, becoming smarter than himself within his lifetime. This would ultimately lead to his groundbreaking work in the field of deep learning.

In the 1980s, he studied computer science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he earned his diploma in 1987. His thesis was on the ultimate self-improving machines that, not only, learn through some pre-wired human-designed learning algorithm, but also learn and improve the learning algorithm itself. Decades later, this became a hot topic. He also received his Ph.D. at TUM in 1991 for work that laid some of the foundations of modern AI.

Schmidhuber is best known for his contributions to the development of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the most powerful type of artificial neural network that can process sequential data such as speech and natural language. With his students Sepp Hochreiter, Felix Gers, Alex Graves, Daan Wierstra, and others, he published architectures and training algorithms for the long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of RNN that is widely used in natural language processing, speech recognition, video games, robotics, and other applications. LSTM has become the most cited neural network of the 20th century, and Business Week called it ""[arguably the most commercial AI achievement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-15/google-amazon-and-facebook-owe-j-rgen-schmidhuber-a-fortune?leadSource=uverify%20wall).""

Throughout his career, Schmidhuber has received various awards and accolades for his groundbreaking work. In 2013, he was awarded the Helmholtz Prize, which recognizes significant contributions to the field of machine learning. In 2016, he was awarded the IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award for ""*pioneering contributions to deep learning and neural networks."" The media have often called him the “father of modern AI,*” because the [most cited neural networks](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/most-cited-neural-nets.html) all build on his lab’s work. He is quick to point out, however, that AI history [goes back centuries.](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html)

Despite his many accomplishments, at the age of 60, he feels mounting time pressure towards building an Artificial General Intelligence within his lifetime and remains committed to pushing the boundaries of AI research and development. He is currently director of the KAUST AI Initiative, scientific director of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, and co-founder and chief scientist of AI company NNAISENSE, whose motto is ""AI∀"" which is a math-inspired way of saying ""AI For All."" He continues to work on cutting-edge AI technologies and applications to improve human health and extend human lives and make lives easier for everyone.

*The following interview has been edited for clarity.*

**Jones: Thank you Juergen for joining me. You have signed letters warning about AI weapons. But you didn't sign the recent publication, ""Pause Gigantic AI Experiments: An Open Letter""? Is there a reason?**

**Schmidhuber:** Thank you Hessie. Glad to speak with you. I have realized that many of those who warn in public against the dangers of AI are just seeking publicity. I don't think the latest letter will have any significant impact because many AI researchers, companies, and governments will ignore it completely.

The proposal frequently uses the word ""we"" and refers to ""us,"" the humans. But as I have pointed out many times in the past, there is no ""we"" that everyone can identify with. Ask 10 different people, and you will hear 10 different opinions about what is ""good."" Some of those opinions will be completely incompatible with each other. Don't forget the enormous amount of conflict between the many people.

The letter also says, ""*If such a pause cannot be quickly put in place, governments should intervene and impose a moratorium.*"" The problem is that different governments have ALSO different opinions about what is good for them and for others. Great Power A will say, if we don't do it, Great Power B will, perhaps secretly, and gain an advantage over us. The same is true for Great Powers C and D.

**Jones: Everyone acknowledges this fear surrounding current generative AI technology. Moreover, the existential threat of this technology has been publicly acknowledged by** [**Sam Altman**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65616866)**, CEO of OpenAI himself, calling for AI regulation. From your perspective, is there an existential threat?**

**Schmidhuber:** It is true that AI can be weaponized, and I have no doubt that there will be all kinds of AI arms races, but AI does not introduce a new quality of existential threat. The threat coming from AI weapons seems to pale in comparison to the much older threat from nuclear hydrogen bombs that don’t need AI at all. We should be much more afraid of half-century-old tech in the form of H-bomb rockets. The Tsar Bomba of 1961 had almost 15 times more destructive power than all weapons of WW-II combined.  Despite the dramatic nuclear disarmament since the 1980s, there are still more than enough nuclear warheads to wipe out human civilization within two hours, without any AI I’m much more worried about that old existential threat than the rather harmless AI weapons.

**Jones: I realize that while you compare AI to the threat of nuclear bombs, there is a current danger that a current technology can be put in the hands of humans and enable them to “eventually” exact further harms to individuals of group in a very precise way, like targeted drone attacks. You are giving people a toolset that they've never had before, enabling bad actors, as some have pointed out, to be able to do a lot more than previously because they didn't have this technology.**

**Schmidhuber:** Now, all that sounds horrible in principle, but our existing laws are sufficient to deal with these new types of weapons enabled by AI. If you kill someone with a gun, you will go to jail. Same if you kill someone with one of these drones. Law enforcement will get better at understanding new threats and new weapons and will respond with better technology to combat these threats. Enabling drones to target persons from a distance in a way that requires some tracking and some intelligence to perform, which has traditionally been performed by skilled humans, to me, it seems is just an improved version of a traditional weapon, like a gun, which is, you know, a little bit smarter than the old guns.

But, in principle, all of that is not a new development. For many centuries, we have had the evolution of better weaponry and deadlier poisons and so on, and law enforcement has evolved their policies to react to these threats over time. So, it's not that we suddenly have a new quality of existential threat and it's much more worrisome than what we have had for about six decades. A large nuclear warhead doesn’t need fancy face recognition to kill an individual. No, it simply wipes out an entire city with ten million inhabitants.

**Jones: The existential threat that’s implied is the extent to which humans have control over this technology. We see some early cases of opportunism which, as you say, tends to get more media attention than positive breakthroughs. But you’re implying that this will all balance out?**

**Schmidhuber:** Historically, we have a long tradition of technological breakthroughs that led to advancements in weapons for the purpose of defense but also for protection. From sticks, to rocks, to axes to gunpowder to cannons to rockets… and now to drones… this has had a drastic influence on human history but what has been consistent throughout history is that those who are using technology to achieve their own ends are themselves, facing the same technology because the opposing side is learning to use it against them. And that's what has been repeated in thousands of years of human history and it will continue. I don't see the new AI arms race as something that is remotely as existential a threat as the good old nuclear warheads.

You said something important, in that some people prefer to talk about the downsides rather than the benefits of this technology, but that's misleading, because 95% of all AI research and AI development is about making people happier and advancing human life and health.

**Jones: Let’s touch on some of those beneficial advances in AI research that have been able to radically change present day methods and achieve breakthroughs.**

**Schmidhuber:** All right! For example, eleven years ago, our team with my postdoc Dan Ciresan was the first to win a [medical imaging competition through deep learning](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/first-time-deep-learning-won-medical-imaging-contest-september-2012.html). We analyzed female breast cells with the objective to determine harmless cells vs. those in the pre-cancer stage. Typically, a trained oncologist needs a long time to make these determinations. Our team, who knew nothing about cancer, were able to train an artificial neural network, which was totally dumb in the beginning, on lots of this kind of data. It was able to outperform all the other methods. Today, this is being used not only for breast cancer, but also for radiology and detecting plaque in arteries, and many other things.  Some of the neural networks that we have developed in the last 3 decades are now prevalent across thousands of healthcare applications, detecting Diabetes and Covid-19 and what not. This will eventually permeate across all healthcare. The good consequences of this type of AI are much more important than the click-bait new ways of conducting crimes with AI.

**Jones: Adoption is a product of reinforced outcomes. The massive scale of adoption either leads us to believe that people have been led astray, or conversely, technology is having a positive effect on people’s lives.**

**Schmidhuber:** The latter is the likely case. There's intense commercial pressure towards good AI rather than bad AI because companies want to sell you something, and you are going to buy only stuff you think is going to be good for you. So already just through this simple, commercial pressure, you have a tremendous bias towards good AI rather than bad AI. However, doomsday scenarios like in Schwarzenegger movies grab more attention than documentaries on AI that improve people’s lives.

**Jones: I would argue that people are drawn to good stories – narratives that contain an adversary and struggle, but in the end, have happy endings. And this is consistent with your comment on human nature and how history, despite its tendency for violence and destruction of humanity, somehow tends to correct itself.**

**Let’s take the example of a technology, which you are aware – GANs – General Adversarial Networks, which today has been used in applications for fake news and disinformation. In actuality, the purpose in the invention of GANs was far from what it is used for today.**

**Schmidhuber:** Yes, the name GANs was created in 2014 but we had the basic principle already in the early 1990s. More than 30 years ago, I called it *artificial curiosity*. It's a very simple way of injecting creativity into a little two network system. This creative AI is not just trying to slavishly imitate humans. Rather, it’s inventing its own goals. Let me explain:

You have two networks. One network is producing outputs that could be anything, any action. Then the second network is looking at these actions and it’s trying to predict the consequences of these actions. An action could move a robot, then something happens, and the other network is just trying to predict what will happen.

Now we can implement artificial curiosity by reducing the prediction error of the second network, which, at the same time, is the reward of the first network. The first network wants to maximize its reward and so it will invent actions that will lead to situations that will surprise the second network, which it has not yet learned to predict well.

In the case where the outputs are fake images, the first network will try to generate images that are good enough to fool the second network, which will attempt to predict the reaction of the environment: fake or real image, and it will try to become better at it. The first network will continue to also improve at generating images whose type the second network will not be able to predict. So, they fight each other. The 2nd network will continue to reduce its prediction error, while the 1st network will attempt to maximize it.

Through this zero-sum game the first network gets better and better at producing these convincing fake outputs which look almost realistic. So, once you have an interesting set of images by Vincent Van Gogh, you can generate new images that leverage his style, without the original artist having ever produced the artwork himself.

**Jones: I see how the Van Gogh example can be applied in an education setting and there are countless examples of artists mimicking styles from famous painters but image generation from this instance that can happen within seconds is quite another feat. And you know this is how GANs has been used. What’s more prevalent today is a socialized enablement of generating images or information to intentionally fool people. It also surfaces new harms that deal with the threat to intellectual property and copyright, where laws have yet to account for. And from your perspective this was not the intention when the model was conceived. What was your motivation in your early conception of what is now GANs?**

**Schmidhuber:** My old motivation for GANs was actually very important and it was not to create deepfakes or fake news but to enable AIs to be curious and invent their own goals, to make them explore their environment and make them creative.

Suppose you have a robot that executes one action, then something happens, then it executes another action, and so on, because it wants to achieve certain goals in the environment. For example, when the battery is low, this will trigger “pain” through hunger sensors, so it wants to go to the charging station, without running into obstacles, which will trigger other pain sensors. It will seek to minimize pain (encoded through numbers). Now the robot has a friend, the second network, which is a world model ––it’s a prediction machine that learns to predict the consequences of the robot’s actions.

Once the robot has a good model of the world, it can use it for planning. It can be used as a simulation of the real world. And then it can determine what is a good action sequence. If the robot imagines this sequence of actions, the model will predict a lot of pain, which it wants to avoid. If it plays this alternative action sequence in its mental model of the world, then it will predict a rewarding situation where it’s going to sit on the charging station and its battery is going to load again. So, it'll prefer to execute the latter action sequence.

In the beginning, however, the model of the world knows nothing, so how can we motivate the first network to generate experiments that lead to data that helps the world model learn something it didn’t already know? That’s what artificial curiosity is about. The dueling two network systems effectively explore uncharted environments by creating experiments so that over time the curious AI gets a better sense of how the environment works. This can be applied to all kinds of environments, and has medical applications.

**Jones: Let’s talk about the future. You have said, “*****Traditional humans won’t play a significant role in spreading intelligence across the universe.*****”**

**Schmidhuber:** Let’s first conceptually separate two types of AIs. The first type of AI are tools directed by humans. They are trained to do specific things like accurately detect diabetes or heart disease and prevent attacks before they happen. In these cases, the goal is coming from the human. More interesting AIs are setting their own goals. They are inventing their own experiments and learning from them. Their horizons expand and eventually they become more and more general problem solvers in the real world. They are not controlled by their parents, but much of what they learn is through self-invented experiments.

A robot, for example, is rotating a toy, and as it is doing this, the video coming in through the camera eyes, changes over time and it begins to learn how this video changes and learns how the 3D nature of the toy generates certain videos if you rotate it a certain way, and eventually, how gravity works, and how the physics of the world works. Like a little scientist!

And I have predicted for decades that future scaled-up versions of such AI scientists will want to further expand their horizons, and eventually go where most of the physical resources are, to build more and bigger AIs. And of course, almost all of these resources are far away from earth out there in space, which is hostile to humans but friendly to appropriately designed AI-controlled robots and self-replicating robot factories. So here we are not talking any longer about our tiny biosphere; no, we are talking about the much bigger rest of the universe.  Within a few tens of billions of years, curious self-improving [AIs will colonize the visible cosmos](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/falling-walls-the-past-present-and-future-of-artificial-intelligence/) in a way that’s infeasible for humans. Those who don’t won’t have an impact. Sounds like science fiction, but since the 1970s I have been unable to see a plausible alternative to this scenario, except for a global catastrophe such as an all-out nuclear war that stops this development before it takes off.

**Jones: How long have these AIs, which can set their own goals — how long have they existed? To what extent can they be independent of human interaction?**

**Schmidhuber:** Neural networks like that have existed for over 30 years. My first simple adversarial neural network system of this kind is the one from 1990 described above. You don’t need a teacher there; it's just a little agent running around in the world and trying to invent new experiments that surprise its own prediction machine.

Once it has figured out certain parts of the world, the agent will become bored and will move on to more exciting experiments. The simple 1990 systems I mentioned have certain limitations, but in the past three decades, we have also built more [sophisticated systems that are setting their own goals](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/artificial-curiosity-since-1990.html) and such systems I think will be essential for achieving true intelligence. If you are only imitating humans, you will never go beyond them. So, you really must give AIs the freedom to explore previously unexplored regions of the world in a way that no human is really predefining.

**Jones: Where is this being done today?**

**Schmidhuber:** Variants of neural network-based artificial curiosity are used today for agents that learn to play video games in a human-competitive way. We have also started to use them for automatic design of experiments in fields such as materials science. I bet many other fields will be affected by it: chemistry, biology, drug design, you name it. However, at least for now, these artificial scientists, as I like to call them, cannot yet compete with human scientists.

I don’t think it’s going to stay this way but, at the moment, it’s still the case.  Sure, AI has made a lot of progress. Since 1997, there have been superhuman chess players, and since 2011, through the DanNet of my team, there have been [superhuman visual pattern recognizers](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/DanNet-triggers-deep-CNN-revolution-2011.html). But there are other things where humans, at the moment at least, are much better, in particular, science itself.  In the lab we have many first examples of self-directed artificial scientists, but they are not yet convincing enough to appear on the radar screen of the public space, which is currently much more fascinated with simpler systems that just imitate humans and write texts based on previously seen human-written documents.

**Jones: You speak of these numerous instances dating back 30 years of these lab experiments where these self-driven agents are deciding and learning and moving on once they’ve learned. And I assume that that rate of learning becomes even faster over time. What kind of timeframe are we talking about when this eventually is taken outside of the lab and embedded into society?**

**Schmidhuber:** This could still take months or even years :-) Anyway, in the not-too-distant future, we will probably see artificial scientists who are good at devising experiments that allow them to discover new, previously unknown physical laws.

As always, we are going to profit from the old trend that has held at least since 1941: every decade compute is getting 100 times cheaper.

**Jones: How does this trend affect modern AI such as ChatGPT?**

**Schmidhuber:** Perhaps you know that all the recent famous AI applications such as ChatGPT and similar models are largely based on principles of artificial neural networks invented in the previous millennium. The main reason why they works so well now is the incredible acceleration of compute per dollar.

ChatGPT is driven by a neural network called “Transformer” described in 2017 by Google. I am happy about that because a quarter century earlier in 1991 I had a particular Transformer variant which is now called the “[Transformer with linearized self-attention](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI/status/1576966129993797632?cxt=HHwWgMDSkeKVweIrAAAA)”. Back then, not much could be done with it, because the compute cost was a million times higher than today. But today, one can train such models on half the internet and achieve much more interesting results.

**Jones: And for how long will this acceleration continue?**

**Schmidhuber:** There's no reason to believe that in the next 30 years, we won't have another factor of 1 million and that's going to be really significant. In the near future, for the first time we will have many not-so expensive devices that can compute as much as a human brain. The physical limits of computation, however, are much further out so even if the trend of a factor of 100 every decade continues, the physical limits (of 1051 elementary instructions per second and kilogram of matter) won’t be hit until, say, the mid-next century. Even in our current century, however, we’ll probably have many machines that compute more than all 10 billion human brains collectively and you can imagine, everything will change then!

**Jones: That is the big question. Is everything going to change? If so, what do you say to the next generation of leaders, currently coming out of college and university. So much of this change is already impacting how they study, how they will work, or how the future of work and livelihood is defined. What is their purpose and how do we change our systems so they will adapt to this new version of intelligence?**

**Schmidhuber:** For decades, people have asked me questions like that, because you know what I'm saying now, I have basically said since the 1970s, it’s just that today, people are paying more attention because, back then, they thought this was science fiction.

They didn't think that I would ever come close to achieving my crazy life goal of building a machine that learns to become smarter than myself such that I can retire. But now many have changed their minds and think it's conceivable. And now I have two daughters, 23 and 25. People ask me: what do I tell them? They know that Daddy always said, “*It seems likely that within your lifetimes, you will have new types of intelligence that are probably going to be superior in many ways, and probably all kinds of interesting ways.*” How should they prepare for that? And I kept telling them the obvious: **Learn how to learn new things**! It's not like in the previous millennium where within 20 years someone learned to be a useful member of society, and then took a job for 40 years and performed in this job until she received her pension. Now things are changing much faster and we must learn continuously just to keep up. I also told my girls that no matter how smart AIs are going to get, learn at least the basics of math and physics, because that’s the essence of our universe, and anybody who understands this will have an advantage, and learn all kinds of new things more easily. I also told them that social skills will remain important, because most future jobs for humans will continue to involve interactions with other humans, but I couldn’t teach them anything about that; they know much more about social skills than I do.

You touched on the big philosophical question about people’s purpose. Can this be answered without answering the even grander question: What’s the purpose of the entire universe?

We don’t know. But what’s happening right now might be connected to the unknown answer. Don’t think of humans as the crown of creation. Instead view human civilization as part of a much grander scheme, an important step (but not the last one) on the path of the universe from very simple initial conditions towards more and more unfathomable complexity. Now it seems ready to take its [next step, a step comparable to the invention of life itself over 3.5 billion years ago](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html#future).  Alas, don’t worry, in the end, all will be good!

**Jones: Let’s get back to this transformation happening right now with OpenAI. There are many questioning the efficacy and accuracy of ChatGPT, and are concerned its release has been premature. In light of the rampant adoption, educators have banned its use over concerns of plagiarism and how it stifles individual development. Should large language models like ChatGPT be used in school?**

**Schmidhuber:** When the calculator was first introduced, instructors forbade students from using it in school. Today, the consensus is that kids should learn the basic methods of arithmetic, but they should also learn to use the “artificial multipliers” aka calculators, even in exams, because laziness and efficiency is a hallmark of intelligence. Any intelligent being wants to minimize its efforts to achieve things.

And that's the reason why we have tools, and why our kids are learning to use these tools. The first stone tools were invented maybe 3.5 million years ago; tools just have become more sophisticated over time. In fact, humans have changed in response to the properties of their tools. Our anatomical evolution was shaped by tools such as spears and fire. So, it's going to continue this way. And there is no permanent way of preventing large language models from being used in school.

**Jones: And when our children, your children graduate, what does their future work look like?**

**Schmidhuber:** A single human trying to predict details of how 10 billion people and their machines will evolve in the future is like a single neuron in my brain trying to predict what the entire brain and its tens of billions of neurons will do next year. 40 years ago, before the WWW was created at CERN in Switzerland, who would have predicted all those young people making money as YouTube video bloggers?

Nevertheless, let’s make a few limited job-related observations. For a long time, people have thought that desktop jobs may require more intelligence than skills trade or handicraft professions. But now, it turns out that it's much easier to replace certain aspects of desktop jobs than replacing a carpenter, for example. Because everything that works well in AI is happening behind the screen currently, but not so much in the physical world.

There are now artificial systems that can read lots of documents and then make really nice summaries of these documents. That is a desktop job. Or you give them a description of an illustration that you want to have for your article and pretty good illustrations are being generated that may need some minimal fine-tuning. But you know, all these desktop jobs are much easier to facilitate than the real tough jobs in the physical world. And it's interesting that the things people thought required intelligence, like playing chess, or writing or summarizing documents, are much easier for machines than they thought. But for things like playing football or soccer, there is no physical robot that can remotely compete with the abilities of a little boy with these skills. So, AI in the physical world, interestingly, is much harder than AI behind the screen in virtual worlds. And it's really exciting, in my opinion, to see that jobs such as plumbers are much more challenging than playing chess or writing another tabloid story.

**Jones: The way data has been collected in these large language models does not guarantee personal information has not been excluded. Current consent laws already are outdated when it comes to these large language models (LLM). The concern, rightly so, is increasing surveillance and loss of privacy. What is your view on this?**

**Schmidhuber:** As I have indicated earlier: are surveillance and loss of privacy inevitable consequences of increasingly complex societies? Super-organisms such as cities and states and companies consist of numerous people, just like people consist of numerous cells. These cells enjoy little privacy. They are constantly monitored by specialized ""police cells"" and ""border guard cells"": Are you a cancer cell? Are you an external intruder, a pathogen? Individual cells sacrifice their freedom for the benefits of being part of a multicellular organism.

Similarly, for super-organisms such as nations. Over 5000 years ago, writing enabled recorded history and thus became its inaugural and most important invention. Its initial purpose, however, was to facilitate surveillance, to track citizens and their tax payments. The more complex a super-organism, the more comprehensive its collection of information about its constituents.

200 years ago, at least, the parish priest in each village knew everything about all the village people, even about those who did not confess, because they appeared in the confessions of others. Also, everyone soon knew about the stranger who had entered the village, because some occasionally peered out of the window, and what they saw got around. Such control mechanisms were temporarily lost through anonymization in rapidly growing cities but are now returning with the help of new surveillance devices such as smartphones as part of digital nervous systems that tell companies and governments a lot about billions of users. Cameras and drones etc. are becoming increasingly tinier and more ubiquitous. More effective recognition of faces and other detection technology are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and many will use it to identify others anywhere on earth; the big wide world will not offer any more privacy than the local village. Is this good or bad? Some nations may find it easier than others to justify more complex kinds of super-organisms at the expense of the privacy rights of their constituents.

**Jones: So, there is no way to stop or change this process of collection, or how it continuously informs decisions over time? How do you see governance and rules responding to this, especially amid** [**Italy’s ban on ChatGPT following**](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/italy-has-banned-chatgpt-heres-what-other-countries-are-doing.html) **suspected user data breach and the more recent news about the** [**Meta’s record $1.3billion fine**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-given-record-13-bln-fine-given-5-months-stop-eu-us-data-flows-2023-05-22/) **in the company’s handling of user information?**

**Schmidhuber:** Data collection has benefits and drawbacks, such as the loss of privacy. How to balance those? I have argued for addressing this through data ownership in data markets. If it is true that data is the new oil, then it should have a price, just like oil. At the moment, the major surveillance platforms such as Meta do not offer users any money for their data and the transitive loss of privacy. In the future, however, we will likely see attempts at creating efficient data markets to figure out the data's true financial value through the interplay between supply and demand.

Even some of the sensitive medical data should not be priced by governmental regulators but by patients (and healthy persons) who own it and who may sell or license parts thereof as micro-entrepreneurs in a healthcare data market.

Following a previous [interview](https://www.swissre.com/institute/conferences/The-intelligence-behind-artificial-intelligence.html), I gave for one of the largest re-insurance companies , let's look at the different participants in such a data market: patients, hospitals, data companies. (1) **Patients** with a rare form of cancer can offer more valuable data than patients with a very common form of cancer. (2) **Hospitals** and their machines are needed to extract the data, e.g., through magnet spin tomography, radiology, evaluations through human doctors, and so on. (3) **Companies** such as Siemens, Google or IBM would like to buy annotated data to make better artificial neural networks that learn to predict pathologies and diseases and the consequences of therapies. Now the market’s invisible hand will decide about the data’s price through the interplay between demand and supply. On the demand side, you will have several companies offering something for the data, maybe through an app on the smartphone (a bit like a stock market app). On the supply side, each patient in this market should be able to profit from high prices for rare valuable types of data. Likewise, competing data extractors such as hospitals will profit from gaining recognition and trust for extracting data well at a reasonable price. The market will make the whole system efficient through incentives for all who are doing a good job. Soon there will be a flourishing ecosystem of commercial data market advisors and what not, just like the ecosystem surrounding the traditional stock market. The value of the data won’t be determined by governments or ethics committees, but by those who own the data and decide by themselves which parts thereof they want to license to others under certain conditions.

At first glance, a market-based system seems to be detrimental to the interest of certain monopolistic companies, as they would have to pay for the data - some would prefer free data and keep their monopoly. However, since every healthy and sick person in the market would suddenly have an incentive to collect and share their data under self-chosen anonymity conditions, there will soon be many more useful data to evaluate all kinds of treatments. On average, people will live longer and healthier, and many companies and the entire healthcare system will benefit.

**Jones: Finally, what is your view on open source versus the private companies like Google and OpenAI? Is there a danger to supporting these private companies’ large language models versus trying to keep these models open source and transparent, very much like what LAION is doing?**

**Schmidhuber:** I signed this [open letter by LAION](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2023/04/19/amid-growing-call-to-pause-ai-research-laion-petitions-governments-to-keep-agi-research-open-active-and-responsible/?sh=6973c08b62e3) because I strongly favor the open-source movement. And I think it's also something that is going to challenge whatever big tech dominance there might be at the moment. Sure, the best models today are run by big companies with huge budgets for computers, but the exciting fact is that open-source models are not so far behind, some people say maybe six to eight months only. Of course, the private company models are all based on stuff that was created in academia, often in little labs without so much funding, which publish without patenting their results and open source their code and others take it and improved it.

Big tech has profited tremendously from academia; their main achievement being that they have scaled up everything greatly, sometimes even failing to credit the original inventors.

So, it's very interesting to see that as soon as some big company comes up with a new scaled-up model, lots of students out there are competing, or collaborating, with each other, trying to come up with equal or better performance on smaller networks and smaller machines. And since they are open sourcing, the next guy can have another great idea to improve it, so now there’s tremendous competition also for the big companies.

Because of that, and since AI is still getting exponentially cheaper all the time, I don't believe that big tech companies will dominate in the long run. They find it very hard to compete with the enormous open-source movement. As long as you can encourage the open-source community, I think you shouldn't worry too much. Now, of course, you might say if everything is open source, then the bad actors also will more easily have access to these AI tools. And there's truth to that. But as always since the invention of controlled fire, it was good that knowledge about how technology works quickly became public such that everybody could use it. And then, against any bad actor, there's almost immediately a counter actor trying to nullify his efforts. You see, I still believe in our old motto ""AI∀"" or ""AI For All.""

**Jones: Thank you, Juergen for sharing your perspective on this amazing time in history. It’s clear that with new technology, the enormous potential can be matched by disparate and troubling risks which we’ve yet to solve, and even those we have yet to identify. If we are to dispel the fear of a sentient system for which we have no control, humans, alone need to take steps for more responsible development and collaboration to ensure AI technology is used to ultimately benefit society. Humanity will be judged by what we do next.**"
123,machinelearning,llm,comments,2022-12-22 18:39:30,[D] When chatGPT stops being free: Run SOTA LLM in cloud,_underlines_,False,0.95,352,zstequ,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/zstequ/d_when_chatgpt_stops_being_free_run_sota_llm_in/,95,1671734370.0,"Edit: Found [LAION-AI/OPEN-ASSISTANT](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant) a very promising project opensourcing the idea of chatGPT. [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

The general-english-65535 vocabulary, and the code versions are already complete. The general-english-32000 should be finished within a few hours. Then I'm going test a non-greedy version which should do even better.

**Intro from README:**

tokenmonster is a novel approach to tokenization with broad-ranging use potential, but its primary motivation is to increase the inference speed and context-length of large language models by choosing better tokens. By selecting more optimal tokens, text can be represented with 20-30% less tokens compared to other modern tokenizing methods, increasing the speed of inference, training and the length of text by 20-30%. The code-optimized tokenizers do even better, [see it for yourself](https://bot.co/tokenmonster.html).

I also believe that tokenmonster vocabularies will improve the comprehension of Large Language Models. For more details see [How and Why](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster#how-and-why).

## Features

* Longer text generation at faster speed
* Determines the optimal token combination for a greedy tokenizer (non-greedy support coming)
* Successfully identifies common phrases and figures of speech
* Works with all languages and formats, even binary
* Quickly skims over HTML tags, sequential spaces, tabs, etc. without wasting context
* Does not require normalization or preprocessing of text
* Averages > 5 tokens per character
* No GPU needed

Edit: There is some misunderstanding about my ""performance"" claim, that claim is speed performance, not quality performance. By optimally tokenizing this increases the speed of inference and training (because there are less tokens to train and infer on), and it increases the total amount of text that can be output within the context-length (because the tokens decode to more text). It will probably make zero difference to LLM quality, however you could run a better model within the same time, so all these things are related."

Abstract:

>Recent advancements in decision-making large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive performance across various benchmarks. However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing these methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess certain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, **specifically the ability to learn from mistakes**. **Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve novel problems through a process of trial and error.** Building on recent research, we propose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with **dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities.** To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective heuristic that **enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances, avoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment.** To assess our approach, we evaluate the agent's ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments and knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA environments. We observe success rates of 97% and 51%, respectively, and provide a discussion on the emergent property of self-reflection.

I found the reasoning to be very sound and promising for the OSS and AI community.

The  biggest risk from AI, in my opinion, is not the doomsday scenarios that  intuitively come to mind but rather that the most powerful AI systems  will only be accessible to the most powerful and resourceful  corporations.

Quote copied from Ben Thompson's write up on Meta's earning in his [Stratechery blog post](https://stratechery.com/2023/facebook-earnings-generative-ai-and-messaging-monetization-open-source-and-ai/) which goes beyond AI. *It's behind a paywall but I highly recommend it personally.*

Some noteworthy quotes that signal the thought process at Meta FAIR and more broadly

* We’re just playing a different game on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon
* We would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that.
* ...lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools
* Open sourcing low level tools make the way we run all this infrastructure more efficient over time.
* On  PyTorch: It’s generally been very valuable for us to provide that  because now  all of the best developers across the industry are using  tools that  we’re also using internally.
* I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem.

For  all the negative that comes out of the popular discourse on Meta, I  think their work to open source key tech tools over the last 10 years  has been exceptional, here's hoping it continues into this decade of AI  and pushes other tech giants to also realize the benefits of Open  Source.

Full Transcript:

>Right  now most of the companies that are training large language  models have  business models that lead them to a closed approach to development. I  think **there’s an** **important opportunity to help create an  open ecosystem.**  If we can help be a part of this, then much of the  industry will  standardize on using these open tools and help improve  them further. So  this will make it easier for other companies to  integrate with our  products and platforms as we enable more  integrations, and that will  help our products stay at the leading edge  as well.  
Our  approach to AI and our infrastructure has always been fairly  open. We  open source many of our state of the art models so people can   experiment and build with them. This quarter we released our LLaMa LLM   to researchers. It has 65 billion parameters but outperforms larger   models and has proven quite popular. We’ve also open-sourced three other   groundbreaking visual models along with their training data and model   weights — Segment Anything, DinoV2, and our Animated Drawings tool —  and  we’ve gotten positive feedback on all of those as well.  
I  think that there’s an important distinction between the products we  offer and a lot of the technical infrastructure, especially the software  that we write to support that. And historically, whether it’s the Open  Compute project that we’ve done or just open sourcing a lot of the   infrastructure that we’ve built, we’ve historically open sourced a lot   of that infrastructure, even though we haven’t open sourced the code for   our core products or anything like that.  
And the reason why I think why we do this is that unlike some of  the other companies in the space, **we’re not selling a cloud computing service** **where we try to keep the different software infrastructure that we’re building proprietary.** For us, **it’s way better if the industry  standardizes on the basic tools that we’re using**  and therefore we can benefit from the improvements that others make and  others’ use of those tools can, in some cases like Open Compute, **drive down the costs** of  those things which make our business more efficient too. So I think to  some degree **we’re just playing a different game** on the infrastructure  than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon, and that creates different incentives for us.  
So overall, I think **that that’s going to lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing, some of the lower level models and tools**.  But of  course, a lot of the product work itself is going to be  specific and  integrated with the things that we do. So it’s not that  everything we do is going to be open. Obviously, a bunch of this needs  to be developed in a way that creates unique value for our products, but  I think in  terms of the basic models, **I would expect us to be pushing and helping  to build out an open ecosystem** here, which I think is something that’s  going to be important.  
On the AI tools, and we have a bunch of history here, right? So if you  if you look at what we’ve done with **PyTorch**,  for example, which has  generally become the standard in the industry  as a tool that a lot of  folks who are building AI models and different  things in that space use,  **it’s generally been very valuable** for us to provide that because now  all of the **best developers across the industry are using tools that  we’re also using internally**.  So the tool chain is the same. So when they create some innovation, we  can easily integrate it into the things that we’re doing. When we  improve something, it improves other products too. Because it’s  integrated with our technology stack, when there are opportunities to  make integrations with products, it’s much easier to  make sure that  developers and other folks are compatible with the things  that we need  in the way that our systems work.  
So there are a lot of advantages, but **I view this more as a kind of back end infrastructure advantage with potential integrations on the  product side**,  but one that should hopefully enable us to stay at the  leading edge  and integrate more broadly with the community and also make  the way we  run all this infrastructure more efficient over time. There  are a  number of models. I just gave PyTorch as an example. Open Compute  is  another model that has worked really well for us in this way, both to   incorporate both innovation and scale efficiency into our own   infrastructure.  
So I think that  there’s, our incentives I think are basically  aligned towards moving in  this direction. Now that said, there’s a lot  to figure out, right? So  when you asked if there are going to be other opportunities, I hope so. I  can’t speak to what all those things might  be now. This is all quite  early in getting developed. **The better we do at the foundational work, the more opportunities** I think that will come and present themselves. So I think that that’s all stuff that we need to  figure out. But at least **at the base level, I think we’re generally incentivized to move in this direction**. And we also need to figure out  how to go in that direction over time.  
I  mean, I mentioned LLaMA before and I also want to be clear that  while  I’m talking about helping contribute to an open ecosystem, LLaMA  is a  model that we only really made available to researchers and there’s  a  lot of really good stuff that’s happening there. But a lot of the  work  that we’re doing, I think, **we would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So, we’ll need to figure out a way to do that.**"

Why not just use “small” (millions vs billion size) models that are specifically fine-tuned for these final tasks instead? Any benchmarks on how LLMs perform on these down stream tasks ? or it's just that smaller models are not as accessible as an OpenAPI is ?

But it's not! A 100-1000x smaller parameter LLM given a few million games of chess will learn to play at ELO 1500.

This model is only trained to predict the next character in PGN strings (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and is never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess. Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the Elo rating of the players in the game.

We can visualize the internal board state of the model as it's predicting the next character. For example, in this heatmap, we have the ground truth white pawn location on the left, a binary probe output in the middle, and a gradient of probe confidence on the right. We can see the model is extremely confident that no white pawns are on either back rank.

Mostly on the research side which immediately puts him very *hostile* against engineers. But I guess it is understandable given the fact that he works on Meta and Meta has faced a lot of backlash (for good and bad reasons), most especially with Galactica where their first rollout got so bad they had to close it immediately. It's also particularly funny given his political leaning that he is very spiteful of a company that uses *open-source knowledge* and builds on top of it.

Lately, his social media and statements are barrages against ChatGPT and LLM's. Sure, he may have a point here and there but his statements look very petty. Here are some examples

*""By releasing public demos that, as impressive & useful as they may be, have major flaws, established companies have less to gain & more to lose than cash-hungry startups.  If Google & Meta haven't released chatGPT-like things,* ***it's not because they can't****. It's because they won't.""*

*>* Except that anyone in the IT industry knows that big tech companies **cant release** something very fast because of politicking and bureaucracy in the system. It takes years to release something into public in big tech compared to startups.

*""Data on the intellectual contribution to AI from various research organizations. Some of organizations publish knowledge and open-source code for the entire world to use.* ***Others just consume it.""***

***>*** Then adds a graph where the big tech is obviously at the top of the race for most number of AI-related research papers (*without normalizing it to the number of researchers per org*)

*""It's nothing revolutionary, although that's the way it's perceived in the public,"" the computer scientist said. ""It's just that, you know, it's well put together, it's nicely done.""*

\> Except that it is indeed revolutionary in terms of the ***applied research*** framework -- *adding on top of open-source, state-of-the-art research and quickly putting it into production for people to use.*

*""my point is that even* ***the engineering work isn't particularly difficult.*** *I bet that there will be half a dozen similar similar systems within 6 months. If that happens, it's because the underlying science has been around for a while, and the engineering is pretty straightforward.""*

""*I'm trying to correct a \*perception\* by the public & the media who see chatGPT as this incredibly new, innovative, & unique technological breakthrough that is far ahead of everyone else.*  ***It's just not.""***

""*One can regurgitate Python code without any understanding of reality.""*

""*No one is saying LLMs are not useful. I have forcefully said so myself, following the short-lived release of FAIR's* ***Galactica****. People crucified it because it could generate nonsense.* ***ChatGPT*** *does the same thing. But again, that doesn't mean they are not useful.""*

He also seems to undermine the rapid engineering work and MLOps that come with ChatGPT which is funny because Meta hasn't released any substantial product from their research that has seen the light of the day for a week. Also, GPT3 to ChatGPT in itself in a research perspective is a jump. Maybe not as incremental as what Lecun does every paper, but compared to an average paper in the field, it is.

To say that LLMs are not *intelligent* and it just *regurgitates Python code* probably haven't used CoPilot, for example. 

It's a classic case of a researcher-engineer beef. And that a startup can profit from derivatives of research that big tech has published. OpenAI broke their perspective on the profit from research. Big tech tried to produce revolutionary research papers on a surplus but never puts them into production thinking that they are the only companies that could if they want to. Then once one company created a derivative of a large research work and profited from it, it baffled them. Although people could argue that Stable Diffusion did this first in the Generative Image Space.

It's one thing to correct misconceptions in the public. It's also one thing not to be petty about the overnight success of a product and an immediate rise of a company that got embraced warmly by tech and non-tech people. It's petty to gatekeep. At the end of the day, ML is not just about research, it's **applied research**. It's useless until it reaches the end of the tunnel. 99% of research papers out there are just tiny updates over the state of the art which has been a pointless race for about  a year or two, with no reproducible code or published data. 

Inventing combustion engine is just as important as putting it in the car."

Abstract:

>Thanks to rapid progress in artificial intelligence, we have entered an era when technology and philosophy intersect in interesting ways. Sitting squarely at the centre of this intersection are large language models (LLMs). **The more adept LLMs become at mimicking human language, the more vulnerable we become to anthropomorphism, to seeing the systems in which they are embedded as more human-like than they really are.**This trend is amplified by the natural tendency to use philosophically loaded terms, such as ""knows"", ""believes"", and ""thinks"", when describing these systems. To mitigate this trend, this paper advocates the practice of repeatedly stepping back to **remind ourselves of how LLMs, and the systems of which they form a part, actually work.** The hope is that increased scientific precision will encourage more philosophical nuance in the discourse around artificial intelligence, both within the field and in the public sphere.

137,machinelearning,llm,comments,2023-04-17 17:54:43,[Discussion] Translation of Japanese to English using GPT. These are my discoveries after ~100 hours of extensive experimentation and ways I think it can be improved.,NepNep_,False,0.9,309,12pqqg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12pqqg6/discussion_translation_of_japanese_to_english/,62,1681754083.0,"Hello. I am currently experimenting with the viability of LLM models for Japanese to English translation. I've been experimenting with GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 utilizing the DAN protocols, and GPT 4 for this project for around 3 months now with very promising results and I think I've identified several limitations with GPT that if addressed can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of translations.

&#x200B;

The project I'm working on is attempting to translate a light novel series from japanese to english. During these tests I did a deep dive, asking GPT how it is attempting the translations and asking it to modify its translation methodology through various means (I am considering doing a long video outlining all this and showing off the prompts and responses at a later date). Notably this includes asking it to utilize its understanding of the series its translating from its training knowledge to aide in the translation, and providing it with a ""seed"" translation. Basically the seed is a side by side japanese and english translation to show GPT what I'm looking for in terms of grammar and formatting. The english translation notably is a human translation, not a machine translation. The results from these tests provided SIGNIFICANT improvements to the final translation, so significant in fact that a large portion of the text could reasonably be assumed to be human-translated.

&#x200B;

Link to the project I'm working on so you can see my documentation and results: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT\_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

I've probably done around 50-100 hours of extensive testing with translation and methodology over the past 2-3 months. Over that time I've discovered the following:

1. Both GPT3 and GPT4 are significant improvements over traditional translation services such as google or deepl. This may be because Japanese and English are very different languages in how they are written and how their grammar works so prior translation services simply did a direct translation while GPT is capable of understanding the text and rewriting it to account for that. For example in japanese, there are no pronouns like ""he"" and ""her"" so a person's gender might not be clear from the sentence alone. Google Translate and DeepL typically just take a 50/50 guess, while GPT from my experience has been much more capable in getting this right based on understanding the larger context from the paragraph.
2. GPT has a tendency to censor text deliberately if it feels the translation may offend people. This isn't just for things that are blatantly offensive like slurs, it also includes mild sexual content, the kind that is typically approved for teen viewing/reading. The biggest problem is that it doesn't tell you it is censoring anything unless you ask it, meaning everything else may be a solid translation yet it may censor information which can ultimately hurt the translation, especially for story related translations like in my tests. These restrictions can be bypassed with correct prompting. I've had luck using GPT 3's DAN protocols however DAN's translations arent as strong as GPT 4, and I've had luck with GPT 4 by framing the translation as a game with extreme win and loss conditions and telling it that if it censors the translation, it may offend the author of the content since people in japan hold different values from our own.
3. GPT puts too high a focus on accuracy even if instructed not to. This is a good thing to a degree since outside of censorship you know the translation is accurate, however even when explicitly told to put maximum emphasis on readability, even if it hurts the accuracy, and it is allowed to rewrite sentences from the ground up to aide readability, it still puts too strong an emphasis on accuracy. I have determined this through testing that for some reason it is ignoring the request to focus on readability and will still maximize accuracy. The best way I've found to fix this issue is through demonstration, specifically the ""seed"" I mentioned earlier. By giving it a japanese and english translation of the same work but earlier in the story, it then understands how to put more emphasis on readability. The results is something that is 95% within the range of accuracy a professional translator would use while much easier to read.
4. GPT's biggest limitation is the fact that it ""forgets"" the seed way too quickly, usually within a few prompts. I've done testing with its data retention and it appears that if you give it too much information to remember at once it slowly bugs out. With GPT 3 its a hard crash type bug where it just spews nonsense unrelated to your request, however GPT 4 can remember a lot more information and will hard crash if you give it too much info but otherwise builds up errors slowly as you give it more info. I initially believed that there were issues with the token count, but further testing shows that the GPT model simply isn't optimized for this method of translation and a new or reworked model that you can give a seed and it will remember it longer would be better. The seed is one of the best tools for improving its performance

Next steps:

I would like to try to either create my own model or modify an existing one to optimize it for translation. If any1 knows any tools or guides I'd appreciate it."

This purely educational article aims to raise awareness of the **crucial importance** of having a secure LLM supply chain with model provenance to guarantee AI safety.

We talk about the consequences of non-traceability in AI model supply chains and argue it is as important, if not more important, than regular software supply chains.

Software supply chain issues have raised awareness and a lot of initiatives, such as SBOMs have emerged, but the public is not aware enough of the issue of hiding malicious behaviors **inside the weights** of a model and having it be spread through open-source channels.

Even **open-sourcing** the whole process does not solve this issue. Indeed, due to the **randomness** in the hardware (especially the GPUs) and the software, it is [practically impossible to replicate the same weights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02326.pdf?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io) that have been open source. Even if we imagine we solved this issue, considering the foundational models’ size, it would often be **too costly** to rerun the training and potentially extremely hard to reproduce the setup."

>The Technology Innovation Institute (TII) in Abu Dhabi has announced its open-source large language model (LLM), the Falcon 40B. With 40 billion parameters, Falcon 40B is the UAE's first large-scale AI model, indicating the country's ambition in the field of AI and its commitment to promote innovation and research.  
>  
>Unlike most LLMs, which typically only provide non-commercial users access, Falcon 40B is open to both research and commercial usage. The TII has also included the model's weights in the open-source package, which will enhance the model's capabilities and allow for more effective fine-tuning.  
>  
>In addition to the launch of Falcon 40B, the TII has initiated a call for proposals from researchers and visionaries interested in leveraging the model to create innovative use cases or explore further applications. As a reward for exceptional research proposals, selected projects will receive ""training compute power"" as an investment, allowing for more robust data analysis and complex modeling. VentureOne, the commercialization arm of ATRC, will provide computational resources for the most promising projects.  
>  
>TII's Falcon 40B has shown impressive performance since its unveiling in March 2023. When benchmarked using Stanford University’s HELM LLM tool, it used less training compute power compared to other renowned LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-3, DeepMind's Chinchilla AI, and Google's PaLM-62B.  
>  
>Those interested in accessing Falcon 40B or proposing use cases can do so through the [FalconLLM.TII.ae](https://FalconLLM.TII.ae) website. Falcon LLMs open-sourced to date are available under a license built upon the principles of the open-source Apache 2.0 software, permitting a broad range of free use.

Abstract:

>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on complex reasoning by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate intermediate reasoning chains as the rationale to infer the answer. However, existing CoT studies are mostly isolated in the language modality with LLMs, where LLMs are hard to deploy. To elicit CoT reasoning in multimodality, a possible solution is to fine-tune small language models by fusing the vision and language features to perform CoT reasoning. The key challenge is that those language models tend to generate hallucinated reasoning chains that mislead the answer inference. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we propose Multimodal-CoT that incorporates vision features in a decoupled training framework. The framework separates the rationale generation and answer inference into two stages. By incorporating the vision features in both stages, the model is able to generate effective rationales that contribute to answer inference. **With Multimodal-CoT, our model under 1 billion parameters outperforms the previous state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-3.5) by 16% (75.17%->91.68%) on the ScienceQA benchmark and even surpasses human performance.**

I understand all the business reasons for this, I guess... as an end-user and a dude working in ML, I just don't really care about the business reasons.

Consider that a human could remember data from decades in the past. Even if we expanded the LLMs context window to be millions of times longer, it might still not reach that.

However, if we look at most of the LLMs, they already have a method for achieving ""infinite"" memory. Their training on data has encoded tons of propositional facts into their neural networks, which include things like temporal data.  If a model is training while running, perhaps it will be able to memorize recent events. One downside I could see for this though is that it is way more expensive. This is somewhat aligned with biological brains, which are not just storing data via recurrence (although they do use recurrence), but are actively altering their neural structures while running. Part of inference is modifying weights."

Detailed breakdown: [https://blog.pythagora.ai/2023/08/23/430/](https://blog.pythagora.ai/2023/08/23/430/)

For a couple of months, I've been thinking about how can GPT be utilized to generate fully working apps, and I still haven't seen any project that I think has a good approach. I just don't think that Smol developer or GPT engineer can create a fully working production-ready app from scratch without a developer being involved and without any debugging process.

So, I came up with an idea that I've outlined thoroughly in the blog post above, but basically, I have 3 main ""pillars"" that I think a dev tool that generates apps needs to have:

1. **Developer needs to be involved in the process of app creation** \- I think that we are still far away from an LLM that can just be hooked up to a CLI and work by itself to create any kind of an app by itself. Nevertheless, GPT-4 works amazingly well when writing code, and it might be able to even write most of the codebase - but NOT all of it. That's why I think we need a tool that will write most of the code while the developer oversees what the AI is doing and gets involved when needed. When he/she changes the code, GPT Pilot needs to continue working with those changes (eg. adding an API key or fixing a bug when AI gets stuck).
2. **The app needs to be coded step by step** just like a human developer would. All other code generators just give you the entire codebase, which I very hard to get into. I think that if AI creates the app step by step, it will be able to debug it more easily, and the developer who's overseeing it will be able to understand the code better and fix issues as they arise.
3. **This tool needs to be scalable** in a way that it should be able to create a small app the same way it should create a big, production-ready app. There should be mechanisms that enable AI to debug any issue and get requirements for new features so it can continue working on an already-developed app.

So, having these in mind, I created a PoC for a dev tool that can create any kind of app from scratch while the developer oversees what is being developed. I call it **GPT Pilot**.

# Examples

**Here are a couple of demo apps that GPT Pilot created:**

1. [Real time chat app](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot-chat-app-demo)
2. [Markdown editor](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot-demo-markdown-editor.git)
3. [Timer app](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot-timer-app-demo)

How it works

Basically, it acts as a development agency where you enter a short description about what you want to build - then, it clarifies the requirements and builds the code. I'm using a different agent for each step in the process. Here are the diagrams of how GPT Pilot works:

[GPT Pilot Workflow](https://preview.redd.it/w1ryquaps8lb1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2e97ecc40a72d30892cee34c5d74661d316b454)

# Concepts that GPT Pilot uses

**Recursive conversations** (as I call them) are conversations with the LLM that are set up in a way that they can be used “recursively”. For example, if GPT Pilot detects an error, it needs to debug it but let’s say that, during the debugging process, another error happens. Then, GPT Pilot needs to stop debugging the first issue, fix the second one, and then get back to fixing the first issue. This is a very important concept that, I believe, needs to work to make AI build large and scalable apps by itself. It works by rewinding the context and explaining each error in the recursion separately. Once the deepest level error is fixed, we move up in the recursion and continue fixing that error. We do this until the entire recursion is completed.

**Context rewinding** is a relatively simple idea. For solving each development task, the context size of the first message to the LLM has to be relatively the same. For example, *the context size of the first LLM message while implementing development task #5 has to be more or less the same as the first message while developing task #50.* Because of this, the conversation needs to be rewound to the first message upon each task. When GPT Pilot creates code, **it creates the pseudocode** for each code block that it writes as well as **descriptions for each file and folder** that it creates. So, when we need to implement task #50, in a separate conversation, we show the LLM the current folder/file structure; it selects only the code that is relevant for the current task, and then, in the original conversation, we show only the selected code instead of the entire codebase. [Here's a diagram](https://blogpythagora.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/pythagora-product-development-frame-3-1.jpg?w=1714) of what this looks like.

**This is still a research project, so I'm wondering what scientists here think about this approach. What areas would you pay more attention to? What do you think can become a big blocker that will prevent GPT Pilot to, eventually, create a full production-ready app?**"

However, a lot of practical NLP problems can be formulated as classification/ tagging problems. The Pre-ChatGPT systems used to be pretty involved with a lot of moving components (keyword extraction, super long regex, finding nearest vectors in embedding space, etc.).

So, what's actually happening? Are folks replacing specific components with the LLM APIs; or are entire systems being replaced by a series of calls to the LLM APIs? Are BERT-based solutions still used?

Now that the ChatGPT APIs support longer & longer context windows (128k), other than pricing and data privacy concerns, are there any-use cases in which BERT-based/ other solutions would shine; which doesn't require as much compute as models like ChatGPT/ LaMDA/ similar LLMs ?

If it's proprietary data that the said LLM models have no clue about, ofc then you'd be using your own models. But a lot of use-cases seem to revolve around having a general understanding of human language itself (E.g. complaint/ ticket classification/ deriving insights from product reviews).

Basically wondering if it's worth exploring more. They have apparently raised $240mln and are a unicorn so this is an important topic.

Here is the summary of some red flags I have found:

1) Founders have no ML background 

2) Zero released product after several years despite huge funding. 

3) TC article says founded 2021, but every listing claims it is YC2017. One of the founders did a recruiting service from YC 2017, but Imbue is a totally unrelated company with a different founding group so claiming YC affiliation seems dubious/unethical. YC is also not named as an investor in the company anywhere on their website.

4) No-one I have spoken to has ever worked with them/ heard of them outside press 

5) Claim to have raised $240mln, but not clear who from. Named investors on recent $200mln round are ""Astera Institute, NVIDIA, Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt, Notion co-founder Simon Last and others"" which seems like a random group and there is no named lead. As a matter of fact, there is not a single VC named anywhere in their marketing as an investor which would be very unusual for a SF AI startup that has raised >$200mln. Crunchbase also has no VCs/institutional investors recorded. I couldn't find any investor that I would expect to have done significant due diligence. A month after they raised $200mln, they prominently announced that they raised another $12mln from Amazon Alexa and Eric Schmidt - this seems like a pure publicity stunt to me. This announcement of an extra 5% in round funding got a bunch of press articles about it also. They push the press angle incredibly hard.

6) Their CEO has been in the press claiming that they buy their own chips, and they also claim to have a 10k H100 stack, but they literally haven't raised enough funding to buy that many H100s. Maybe they are renting and all the press about buying is just press?

7) The press/publicity to product ratio is extremely high. Dozens of articles in major publications with nothing released and no claimed customers.

8) Their site is full of gushy statements with no detail like ""We pretrain very large (>100B parameter) models, optimized for internal reasoning benchmarks."" (internal reasoning benchmarks is a great way to pretend you have competitive models!) and ""Our north star: truly personal computers that give us freedom, dignity, and agency to do what we love"". As far as I can tell, Imbue has never released even a 3B or 7B open source model like a bunch of similar startups have.

9) Their ""Our Work"" blog that should showcase their research and products contains 4 articles from 2023. 2 of them are opinion pieces on LLM ethics that contain no technical details, 1 is a niche piece on RL in hyperparameter search, and 1 discusses SSL on ResNet50 - a 23mln param CNN that is 5,000 times smaller than the LLMs they are apparently training.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Of course red flags are just that - suggestions of a problem not evidence. Inflection is in a similar boat on many of the above points - their only public product is the inferior Pi model - but at least they have serious industry heavyweights in their management and research so I give them the benefit of the doubt.


So, to those in the know - is this a real company? Has it duped a bunch of rich individuals? Is it worth spending more time on?"

I checked out a new paper investigating why windowed attention fails for this.

By visualizing the attention maps, the researchers noticed LLMs heavily attend initial tokens as ""attention sinks"" even if meaningless. This anchors the distribution.

They realized evicting these sink tokens causes the attention scores to get warped, destabilizing predictions.

Their proposed ""StreamingLLM"" method simply caches a few initial sink tokens plus recent ones. This tweaks LLMs to handle crazy long texts. Models tuned with StreamingLLM smoothly processed sequences with millions of tokens, and were up to 22x faster than other approaches. 

Even cooler - adding a special ""\[Sink Token\]"" during pre-training further improved streaming ability. The model just used that single token as the anchor. I think the abstract says it best:

>We introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a **finite length attention window** to generalize to **infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning**. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.

TLDR: LLMs break on long convos. Researchers found they cling to initial tokens as attention sinks. Caching those tokens lets LLMs chat infinitely.

As you know LLMs are trained at very big scales both in terms of model size and data.

As you know from ML basics, we want to avoid data leakage: the test set must NOT see samples from the training set. That would be cheating.

Someday, maybe if not already done, a model will be trained on almost all the data in existence, that covers up most of the world knowledge.

I think you can easily see my point, if a model has already seen ""everything"", why being so impressed for its capabilities? (not talking about research efforts here, I've been in research myself as well)

Are LLMs capabilities emergent at all if it knows it all about our world?

When we reach that point, when someone builds ""The World Dataset"", it's going to be so hard evaluating real life performance of models. And the leakage will spread everywhere else as well, since people will use the model generations to build new datasets (already happening).

Also, in order to answer to my question, one should first define: what is data leakage in the context of LLMs? Do we even care when building a foundational model?

e.g. If we have the same riddle with different people names, Luke in train and Antoine in test, is the sample leaked? What if they have slightly different wording? Ask this sort of questions for every type of data sample you may have in your LLM dataset.

These big models we train are knowledge compressors, in a lossy way. They learn stuff by iteratively seeing samples, a lot of them. For me this is not intelligence, it's memory and some level of pattern recognition, run at scale. I'd rather be much more impressed if I saw a model that could actually learn from few data and expoit high level concepts to build bigger concepts and then, knowledge. In fact, I'm loving the latest work by Microsoft with the phi-family models and focus on textbook quality data. Much more interesting that building huge MOEs and training with giga amount of data. That's just sheer brute force.

tldr; Imagine if a a model is trained on a virtual World Dataset, with all the world knowledge. Is it smart or is it just data leaking around without you even knowing? e.g. You already know what questions you'll be asked at your uni exam. Are you impressed with current LLMs even though they are trained on HUGE amounts of data?"

So, after listening to the debates about how far can the LLM capabilities go(the whole AGI/ASI thing) and comparisons with systems like AlphaGo, I'm always left wondering whether there's a fundamental thing missing from LLMs, or whether I am getting something wrong. My impression about systems like AlphaGo, AlphaFold, etc, is that, after the initial pre-training phrase, the absolutely fundamental ingredient when it comes to their training is :

1. A constrained environment whose fundamental rules we know with precision(such as Go or molecular dymamics).
2. The ability to search through the solution space using a traditional search algorithm.
3. The ability to write a loss function that very strongly expresses the goal.

From what I understand, when we have those components, this is where we can have the training algorithm explore a solution space as large as Go, while simultaneously using the deep learning model's pattern matching abilities in order to cull a large amount of branches as 'probably not very interesting', something that would otherwise take a lot of resources to compute directly. This continuous feedback allows AlphaGo to continue training by 'playing against itself', and eventually reach and shoot past human performance. What this amounts to, in essense, is the ability to automatically generate a large amount of high-quality synthetic data.

Now, my question is : For ppl that claim that eventually LLMs will also catch up and surpass humans, when it comes to long-term planning and problem solving abilities...what is the way that happens? It seems to me that, when it comes to LLMs, all we have is basically the equivalent of the pre-training phase of AlphaGo, where it is trained from a large amount of human games(and really, AlphaGo had access to higher quality data than GPT4). But the real question is...what exactly is the way forward, when we keep in mind how we reached superhuman performance with AlphaGo?

For example, if the 'game' we want to train an LLM here is how to form a theory that explains a newly observed phenomenon...how does one do that? We don't know how the solution space looks like here, we don't can't write a search algo for it, we can't write a good loss function, we can't generate high-quality synthetic data for this game. If we did, we'd already have ""AGI"". Letting the LLM 'argue with itself' in order to learn how to form good theories cannot be done - there is no ground truth to shape this self-play. This would be similar to pre-training AlphaGo, then letting it play against itself without a tree search or an objective function that can actually tell you ""yes this move does capture opponent pieces"". I doubt its performance would have been significantly increased by self-play in that case.

So my question here is...am I getting something wrong, in my assumptions or conclusions? What is the state here when it comes to training LLMs to truly become experts in such topics? What is considered to be 'the way forward'?"

TL;DR they trained a multimodal model on:

* Image/Video
* Sound
* Depth Maps
* Heat maps
* Text
* IMU (Camera Motion)

The model learned a *single shared representation* across all modalities, allowing it to transfer from any one to any other one. This gives it some novel abilities like generating or retrieving images based on sound clips, or identifying objects that might make a given sound. It also outperforms specialist models trained on supervised data on a variety of zero-shot tasks.

Hey Redditors,

This is a project I've been wanting to do for a while. I've spoken to a lot of folks lately who are interested in using LLMs for their business but there's a ton of confusion around the licensing situation. It seems like the Llama platform has been getting all the love lately and I wanted to see what kind of performance I could get out of the Flan-UL2 model. It's underappreciated in my opinion given it has really strong performance on benchmarks (relative to other models in it's size category) and it supports up to 2048 input tokens which is on par with the Alpaca variants. Additionally, it's available under an Apache 2.0 license which means it's viable for commercial usage. 🔥

Despite being a strong model the base Flan-UL2 doesn't give great ""conversational"" responses, so I wanted to see what it was capable of using a newer dataset. I decided to try both Alpaca and Dolly15K. Alpaca is interesting given the massive improvement it had on Llama. It obviously has some licensing caveats which I discuss in the blog post. Dolly15K, which just came out last week, has none of the licensing ambiguity so I was very interested in seeing how those results compared to Alpaca finetuning.

All of the code I used for training is available in the Github links and the final LoRA models are on HuggingFace. I included benchmark results, comparisons and conclusions in the blog post.

Note that this is one of my first end-to-end finetuning experiments using an LLM so if you see I've made a mistake or have any feedback I'd love to hear it! ❤️

Abstract:

>Large language models have been widely adopted but require significant GPU memory for inference. We develop a procedure for Int8 matrix multiplication for feed-forward and attention projection layers in transformers, which cut the memory needed for inference by half while retaining full precision performance. With our method, a 175B parameter 16/32-bit checkpoint can be loaded, converted to Int8, and used immediately without performance degradation. This is made possible by understanding and working around properties of highly systematic emergent features in transformer language models that dominate attention and transformer predictive performance. To cope with these features, we develop a two-part quantization procedure, LLM.int8(). We first use vector-wise quantization with separate normalization constants for each inner product in the matrix multiplication, to quantize most of the features. **However, for the emergent outliers, we also include a new mixed-precision decomposition scheme, which isolates the outlier feature dimensions into a 16-bit matrix multiplication while still more than 99.9% of values are multiplied in 8-bit. Using LLM.int8(), we show empirically it is possible to perform inference in LLMs with up to 175B parameters without any performance degradation.** This result makes such models much more accessible, for example making it possible to **use OPT-175B/BLOOM on a single server with consumer GPUs.**

**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04415](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04415)

**Abstract**: Weight decay is a broadly used technique for training state-of-the-art deep networks, including large language models. Despite its widespread usage, its role remains poorly understood. In this work, we highlight that the role of weight decay in modern deep learning is different from its regularization effect studied in classical learning theory. For overparameterized deep networks, we show how weight decay modifies the optimization dynamics enhancing the ever-present implicit regularization of SGD via the loss stabilization mechanism. In contrast, for underparameterized large language models trained with nearly online SGD, we describe how weight decay balances the bias-variance tradeoff in stochastic optimization leading to lower training loss. Moreover, we show that weight decay also prevents sudden loss divergences for bfloat16 mixed-precision training which is a crucial tool for LLM training. Overall, we present a unifying perspective from ResNets on vision tasks to LLMs: weight decay is never useful as an explicit regularizer but instead changes the training dynamics in a desirable way.

So we decided to play around with some open source LLM models that could run locally. We wanted to explore if we could create agents with these open source models and have them perform well...

Long story short after trying out many models like Vicuna-13B, MPT-13B, StarCoder... most of them failed.

However they kinda suck at code generation: half of the times they spit out code which doesn't even compile, or that has obvious bugs.

I wonder whether anyone is working on a programming model, trained to program with itself and with a compiler. The idea on how to achieve this would seem simple:

1. Take a LLM trained on all the natural language data you have and as much decent code as you can.

2. Take as many problems as you can: all the coding problems out there, the problems users ask the model to implement, all the existing code on github which is self-contained and has got documentation for what it does.

3. For each problem, and for each programming language, run two instances of the LLM: one has the job to write a solution for the problem; the other one has to write unit-tests instead.

4. Compile the programs (or simply run them, for duck-typed languages): every time something fails, forward the error to the LLM and get it to generate new code. Keep doing this until everything succeeds.  
  If your dataset includes existing solutions (or existing unit tests) for a problem, us these ones too, to make sure that the code the network wrote is good.

5. Use these results to train/fine-tune the LLM and make it better at coding.

6. Run a similar algorithm when the LLM is asked to write some programs by the user (i.e. write both the code + the unit tests; iteratively fix issues until everything works).

Wouldn't something like this have high chances of outperforming current models, as well as a larger portion of software developers, in code generation?

Has anyone attempted to work on something similar?"

I'm currently at a crossroads with a decision that I believe many in this community might have faced or will face at some point: Should I use cloud-based GPU instances like AWS's p3.2xlarge EC2 (with Tesla V100) or invest in building a high-performance rig at home with multiple RTX 4090s for training a large language model?

**Context:** I run a startup and we're currently fine-tuning an open source LLM, and the computational demands are of course high. We want to make an informed choice between using AWS's offerings or setting up a high-performance system at home to start.

**Cloud Option: AWS p3.2xlarge EC2**

* Cost: Approximately $3.06 per hour.
* Specifications: One Tesla V100 GPU, 8 vCPUs, 61 GiB RAM.
* Pros: Scalability, reliability, specialized software optimizations.
* Cons: Recurring costs, potential limitations on customization.

**Home Rig Option: Multiple RTX 4090s**

* Cost: Around $1,600 for each 4090, but I'd own them.
* Specifications: Even higher TFLOPs than a V100, and memory isn't a constraint (24GB per card).
* Pros: One-time investment, flexibility, potentially higher raw computational power.
* Cons: Need to handle cooling, power, and system integration myself

I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and recommendations. Here are some specific questions:

1. Performance: How many RTX 4090s would roughly equal the computational power of an AWS p3.2xlarge instance for ML tasks?
2. Cost-Effectiveness: Given that we're a startup with limited resources, does it make more financial sense to invest upfront in hardware?
3. Reliability and Maintenance: For those who have run multi-GPU setups at home, how reliable are they, and what maintenance work is required?
4. Other Considerations: Are there factors I haven't considered that you think are critical?

We need ways to inspect whether they really ""know"" something is true or not so we can reduce hallucinations.

In a new paper, researchers found that LLMs contain an internal ""truth vector"" - **an emergent linear structure that represents factual truth values.**

They had the insight to visualize how GPT represents simple true/false sentences. The true ones clustered together, while false ones clustered elsewhere - suggesting some kind of 'truth direction' in its learned representations.

To test this, they trained linear ""probes"" on one dataset, and found they could generalize to accurately detect truth values in totally different datasets about other topics.

They also directly modified the models to add or subtract the identified truth vectors from its processing of statements. This could flip assessments of truth value, showing the vector causally influences reasoning.

Together, these findings provide evidence that neural networks can create emergent, linear structures that represent factual truth. This finding could eventually help make AI systems less prone to hallucinations and falsehoods.

**TLDR: LLMs can create emergent linear representations of truth. This sheds light on how AI represents abstract concepts and could help us reduce hallucinations.**

199,machinelearning,llm,comments,2023-12-22 10:54:20,[P] I tried to teach Mistral 7B a new language (Sundanese) and it worked!

I'll start by saying I am not a machine learning expert and I am new to this since getting into LLMs as it got popular since LLaMa release. So, I don't know much of the technicalities although I am willing to learn.

Seeing that even Bing chat which is powered by chatGPT-4 couldn't speak in Sundanese when asked, I thought of trying to teach Mistral-7B Sundanese using just QLora training. It surprisingly worked out pretty well for how little data I had to train it with.

Why Sundanese? Because I can speak it and it is a regional language in Indonesia that isn't used much if at all on the internet so there was basically almost no chance it was trained well on any of these LLM models coming out.

This is more of an exercise to see if a small open-source model like Mistral 7B can be trained to learn a new very obscure language that is apparently never there in the original dataset. More details on the dataset and training settings are in the huggingface model card. Please ask me if you have any questions. Also, I have no idea how I am supposed to name the version, but I just called this 1.0 because the 0.x versions are basically me trial and erroring burning up electricity and heating my place for quite a while.

The resulting model is actually surprisingly coherent and translates knowledge in English to Sundanese decently. Although it is a bit unstable in that sometimes it replies with incorrect information or irrelevant information, which is probably because of the limited dataset. Next steps are going to be to get more datasets to train on, maybe translating the alpaca dataset to Sundanese and training on that.

For the comparisons, I understand that almost no one here understands Sundanese so it's best if you copy paste these to google translate to see what it's saying if you're interested.

**Comparisons**

We can see that without the finetune the model just defaults to replying in Indonesian even though the character card is in Sundanese and says to only reply in Sundanese. This is probably because the model is trained on data that correlates that Sundanese is spoken in Indonesia where people speak Indonesian. It also definitely works best on answering random questions if you asked trivia questions that has a chance to be on Wikipedia.

But why?

LLMs are impressive; they can play chess, emulate a Linux terminal, perform mathematical calculations, convert code, and more. However, in most cases, they perform these tasks poorly, which means they cannot be used as is, at least *not for now*. While we come across numerous cool demos, the results are often cherry-picked and not applicable to real business use cases.

I can only identify a few limited use cases where LLMs truly shine: QA, summarization, and acting as a co-pilot for tasks such as coding, writing, and education etc. In essence, they excel in seq2seq tasks.

There are some notable drawbacks that should be acknowledged:

* Cost: The cost of using LLMs will never be cheaper than specialized solutions.
* Latency: Building real-time applications with LLMs is extremely challenging.
* Quality and Accuracy: For now, LLMs lack strong reasoning capabilities.
* Reliability: Hallucinations are still an issue. Occasionally, the model fails to follow instructions.
* Quotas: Currently, the quotas imposed on LLMs are too low for large-scale production applications.

It is possible that most of these problems will be resolved in the future. However, the question remains: how long will it take? Will it be 1 year, 5 years, or even 10 years? Unfortunately, we need to see a ROI this year.

Anyway, just want to remind you that [there is no free lunch!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem)"

\>  It is also important to consider the evaluation metrics used to measure emergent abilities (BIG-Bench, 2022). For instance, using exact string match as the evaluation metric for long-sequence targets may disguise compounding incremental improvements as emergence. Similar logic may apply for multi-step or arithmetic reasoning problems, where models are only scored on whether they get the final answer to a multi-step problem correct, without any credit given to partially correct solutions. However, the jump in final answer accuracy does not explain why the quality of intermediate steps suddenly emerges to above random, and using evaluation metrics that do not give partial credit are at best an incomplete explanation, because emergent abilities are still observed on many classification tasks (e.g., the tasks in Figure 2D–H).

What do people think? Is emergence ""real"" or substantive?"

They assessed the LLM on 302 real-world case reports from the New England Journal of Medicine. These case reports are known to be highly complex diagnostic challenges.

The LLM produced differential diagnosis lists that included the final confirmed diagnosis in the top 10 possibilities in 177 out of 302 cases, a top-10 accuracy of 59%. **This significantly exceeded the performance of experienced physicians, who had a top-10 accuracy of just 34% on the same cases when unassisted.**

According to assessments from senior specialists, the LLM's differential diagnoses were also rated to be **substantially more appropriate and comprehensive** than those produced by physicians, when evaluated across all 302 case reports.

This research demonstrates the potential for LLMs to enhance physicians' clinical reasoning abilities for complex cases.

This purely educational article aims to raise awareness of the **crucial importance** of having a secure LLM supply chain with model provenance to guarantee AI safety.

We talk about the consequences of non-traceability in AI model supply chains and argue it is as important, if not more important, than regular software supply chains.

Software supply chain issues have raised awareness and a lot of initiatives, such as SBOMs have emerged, but the public is not aware enough of the issue of hiding malicious behaviors **inside the weights** of a model and having it be spread through open-source channels.

Even **open-sourcing** the whole process does not solve this issue. Indeed, due to the **randomness** in the hardware (especially the GPUs) and the software, it is [practically impossible to replicate the same weights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02326.pdf?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io) that have been open source.

It's MIT licensed.

[Code at Github.](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster)

[Test it out.](https://bot.co/tokenmonster.html)

The general-english-65535 vocabulary, and the code versions are already complete. The general-english-32000 should be finished within a few hours. Then I'm going test a non-greedy version which should do even better.

**Intro from README:**

tokenmonster is a novel approach to tokenization with broad-ranging use potential, but its primary motivation is to increase the inference speed and context-length of large language models by choosing better tokens. By selecting more optimal tokens, text can be represented with 20-30% less tokens compared to other modern tokenizing methods, increasing the speed of inference, training and the length of text by 20-30%. The code-optimized tokenizers do even better, [see it for yourself](https://bot.co/tokenmonster.html).

I also believe that tokenmonster vocabularies will improve the comprehension of Large Language Models. For more details see [How and Why](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster#how-and-why).

## Features

* Longer text generation at faster speed
* Determines the optimal token combination for a greedy tokenizer (non-greedy support coming)
* Successfully identifies common phrases and figures of speech
* Works with all languages and formats, even binary
* Quickly skims over HTML tags, sequential spaces, tabs, etc. without wasting context
* Does not require normalization or preprocessing of text
* Averages > 5 tokens per character
* No GPU needed

Edit: There is some misunderstanding about my ""performance"" claim, that claim is speed performance, not quality performance. By optimally tokenizing this increases the speed of inference and training (because there are less tokens to train and infer on), and it increases the total amount of text that can be output within the context-length (because the tokens decode to more text). It will probably make zero difference to LLM quality, however you could run a better model within the same time, so all these things are related."

[video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

# The general intelligence factor in humans

In the early 1900s, Charles Spearman observed that children's performance across diverse school subjects was positively correlated (pictured below). He proposed the concept of a ""general intelligence factor,"" or *g*, to account for this correlation. This is why factor analysis was invented, it was invented by Spearman to quantify *g*.

&#x200B;

[The OG correlation matrix of school subjects](https://preview.redd.it/ohzhx16h6sub1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e0dd8e7b33571618cc2aa3399edabfbd873c12)

A century of research later, *g* has proven to be a robust and reliable construct. The positive correlations between various mental abilities, known as the positive manifold, have become one of the most replicated findings in differential psychology. The *g* factor typically accounts for over 40% of the variance in cognitive ability tests and serves as a strong predictor for various life outcomes.

While Spearman's original two-factor model suggested that intelligence comprises a general factor *g* and specific factors *s* unique to each test, contemporary research has refined this view. Current consensus holds that *g* sits atop a hierarchical model akin to the one shown below, underpinned by several first-order factors.

https://preview.redd.it/9cheo29n6sub1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2eadc486f9727933b24d9f808c3f7effc1b5fd0

# The general intelligence factor in non-human animals

The notion of general intelligence in non-human animals has been a subject of interest since the 1930, shortly after Spearman's concept gained traction. Empirical evidence suggests that *g* is not exclusive to humans. For instance, in rodents like mice, a *g* factor accounts for approximately 35% of the variance in cognitive performance. In a comprehensive meta-analysis covering non-human primates, a single factor explained 47% of the variance across 62 species, indicating a *g* factor similar to that in humans. Even in some bird species, such as bowerbirds, *g* explains over 44% of the variance in cognitive abilities.

However, it's worth noting that *g* may not be universal across all species. For example, evidence suggests that fish may not possess a *g* factor. Despite limitations like low sample size or limited task diversity in research on non-human animals, these findings indicate that *g* is not unique to humans and can sometimes be observed in various non-human species.

# Does g exist in language models?

I suspected *g* might exist in language models and prove itself to be both a powerful explanatory variable and an invaluable tool for measuring LLM ability.

To test for it's existence, I analyzed 1,232 models from the Open LLM Leaderboard and 88 models from the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) Leaderboard. A variety of cognitive subtests were used to assess the models, including ARC Challenge, Hellaswag,  TruthfulQA, MMLU subtests seen in the images below. Factor analysis techniques, specifically principal axis factoring, were employed to extract *g* from the performance data.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oz2yb78x6sub1.png?width=1103&format=png&auto=webp&s=92a853321e015fe17ba89637e0c3c3bf9d71cd14

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9q0an7k07sub1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=e18f216e1b880117a819ca17cda038d66889dcf9

As can be seen, correlations are uniformly positive (and extremely high) between all subtests, showing the existence of a ""positive manifold"". The average correlation in the matrices is .84, exactly the same for both datasets.

There was agreement for all statistical tests across both datasets that a single factor should be extracted (with only a single exception which was dismissed, as discussed in detail in the paper).

After factor analysis was performed, *g* loadings for subtests were obtained. Loosely speaking, the *g* loading is a correlation between *g* and the specific subtest.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m9xuj5c97sub1.png?width=435&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aad5fdaa2dbfa015fb317004c4d6af1dfc163bd

For the sake of brevity I won't post the subtest loading table for GLUE, but that's in the original paper as well. In there, loadings are .78 to .97 approximately.

Now here is an example of how we can rank models according to their general ability:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hrrbvwkg7sub1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=9afa927a7f0674a8946c6b6f5beaae9d1bb63099

In conclusion, both datasets showed an existence of *g* in language models. We now have a new unified method of ranking models based on how generally capable they are across tasks.

# How ""strong"" is g in language models?

About twice as strong as in humans and some animals.

The *g* factor in language models explains 85% of the variance on all tasks, in contrast to roughly 40% for humans and some animals. The number 85% is exactly replicated in both datasets.

The subtask *g* loading averages about .92, significantly higher than about .6 for humans.

# How reliable is g in language models?

After confirming that *g* is reliable across populations (i.e. it exists in both datasets), the study also included reliability analyses to assess the stability of *g* across test batteries and methods of extraction. In short, I wanted to see if we are actually measuring the same thing when we extract *g* from the same language models tested on 2 completely different test batteries.

I'll spare you the details on this one, but the correlation between *g* extracted from disjoint test batteries is basically 1. Same goes for different methods of extraction of *g*, like using PCA instead of FA. The *g* factor is therefore unique and highly reliable.

# Correlation between model size and g

Finally, the relationship between model size and *g* was explored. In short, the correlation was found to be r = .48 (p < .0001; 95% CI \[.44, .52\]). So, there exists a moderate/strong positive relationship between model size and *g*.

# Implications & Future Research

The identification of *g* in language models firstly allows us to measure what we actually want to measure (and compare) in language models, that is general ability. It allows the whole field to have a unified metric that can be used whenever we care more about general ability than some specific ability (like virology knowledge), which is almost always the case.

Another benefit of using *g* as the primary measure of ability in language models is that it prevents researchers fiddling with the administered test(s) until you find the specific test which seems to show that your model is better than the rest. It standardizes ability measurements in LLMs.

Plus, even if your improvement in a specific ability is real and not HARKed / p-hacked to death, it may still be just that, an improvement in specific abilities that don't affect general intelligence at all. This is obviously important to know when an improvement is discussed, and *g* is the measure that can tell us which is it. As an example of specific non-*g* improvements in humans, look up ""Flynn effect"".

I'd argue there's a big resource efficiency gain too, because now you can evaluate your model on a few carefully chosen *g*\-loaded subtests, derive *g* and infer the model's performance on all other tasks instead of testing your model on 200 tests each with 50+ items (like BigBench does, for example).

Apart from that, this method also allows for an objective ranking of various tests based on their *g* loading, which in turn provides a standardized measure of test relevance for specific populations of language models.

As for future research, there's tons of things to do. I'm personally interested in confirming the factor structure of general intelligence in LLMs or seeing impact of fine-tuning and RLHF on *g*. One can also examine which variables other than model size explain variance in *g* or how general ability and social bias correlate. I'd have loved to do these things, and it wouldn't even be hard, but I couldn't because of resource constraints. If you're looking for a paper idea, feel free to continue where I left off.

# Summary / Abstract

This study uncovers the factor of general intelligence, or *g*, in language models, extending the psychometric theory traditionally applied to humans and certain animal species. Utilizing factor analysis on two extensive datasets—Open LLM Leaderboard with 1,232 models and General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) Leaderboard with 88 models—we find compelling evidence for a unidimensional, highly stable *g* factor that accounts for 85% of the variance in model performance. The study also finds a moderate correlation of .48 between model size and *g*. The discovery of the general intelligence factor in language models offers a unified metric for model evaluation and opens new avenues for more robust, *g*\-based model ability assessment. These findings lay the foundation for understanding and future research on artificial general intelligence from a psychometric perspective and have practical implications for model evaluation and development.

# Arxiv enjoyers, I have a small request

In all of this research I have yet to come across a valid and usable metric to measure not only if a LLM is hallucinating but how to show a user where in a LLM output the model hallucinated. Also I have found very few metrics or evaluations that rely solely on a provided context and its summary with no other human annotated support for their evaluations.

In this context I quantify a hallucination as a fact or string of facts that (i.e. Marshall visited the store, Marshall bought Kleenex, Marshall returned home) where in the original source text there is no evidence that ""Marshall"" in this context bought Kleenex or any specific items other then ""groceries"". So thus the model interpreted its meaning of groceries and substituted Kleenex in.

It is also important to state I am only referring in this context to the output of Summarization specific models. I would love to see what this community knows regarding this topic as well as any code or systematic ways to detect this variation in output text and determine its nature as being hallucinated by the model and being unfaithful to the given context."

You might have come across the paper [Mamba paper](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba) in the last days, which was the first attempt at scaling up state space models to 2.8B parameters to work on language data.

Contrary to transformers, this kind of architecture's computational complexity does not scale quadratically with input length, so it would be awesome if it could replace transformers in the long term.  
We were super excited about this paper and the published model, but unfortunately, no training code was provided with it, so we've decided to write it and train a model ourselves. As a result of this, we've just released mamba-chat, which is probably **the best existing LLM that does not rely on transformers.** Honestly, I am super surprised by how well the model performs, given that it's only 2.8B parameters and the base model was only trained on the Pile. Quite exciting to think if these models might dethrone transformers at some point.

Feel free to check out our [Github](https://github.com/havenhq/mamba-chat) or [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/havenhq/mamba-chat) repository! Our Github repo includes a cli chat script, so you can easily run the model if you have access to a GPU."

Just wanted to chat about a project I've got going on at my job. It's a bit out there – we're working on a program to bring back, virtually, someone who's passed away using AI. Specifically, we're creating a virtual character with the same voice and talking style as the person we want to bring back. The idea is to have a conversation with this virtual character, as if we're talking to the person who's no longer with us.

So, I'm using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the text, and we're planning to use Text-To-Speech for the voice. But here's the snag: tweaking the language style and personality of the virtual character in the LLM to get the text to really sound like the person we're emulating is proving tricky.

I gave Gemini/Chat-GPT a shot, but the results are a bit off. The virtual character tends to sound more like a bot assistant, even though I've tried to avoid that. The kicker? I'm the only AI engineer in the company, and I'm strapped for resources and time to fine-tune and hunt for more data.

So, is this project doable? And if it is, any tips or articles you could throw my way would be awesome.

* with scraping context data from a docs website
* chunking it, getting embeddings via the openAI API
* loading it into pinecone
* and finally a simple Q&A interface with streamlit on top of it

**Here's a quick summary:**

* LangChain and LlamaIndex are great tools for quick exploration
* But aren't perfect for production-grade use
* I think we all know the ""LangChain is pointless"" debate, but there's a lot of real meat to it, and Pat describes a few of them (a lot of LangChains extractors are super basic, 2-3 liners without retries etc.)
* LLM applications are all about moving data, extracting and enriching data (creating embeddings!) are the most expensive ones of those steps
* A bunch of data engineering tools are out there that make these two steps much easier, versionable, robust, and reproducible.
* Meltano is one such tool and Pat implemented the above described pipeline with it

**FWIW**: The GitHub project that comes with the post is super easy to run and super modular. I just tested it and was able to modify everything for my own application within 30 mins."

1. Don't do anything, just send the dialog and context to LLM (will not work for 7B models, as they have small context window and will hallucinate/mix up the context and dialog)
2. Ask LLM. The pipeline would look like: user sends a message - send the whole dialog to LLM, ask it ""do you need additional info like \[vector database info example\] to answer last message?"", after that either add info from database, or more messages from the dialog, and send it all to LLM
3. A pipeline I came up myself: Summarize the dialog into one query to LLM based on last message; send this query to LLM, but also send context from vector database - ask LLM whether the info from database helps to answer the question or not; based on the answer, either send the query with database context to LLM as final query, or send it the dialog as context, no data from database.

However, what seems strange is that this no code out of the box solution (Copilot Studio - just as an example of one) seems overwhelmingly to be the better option if you wanted to build a RAG app i.e If you compare the cost to build and productionise a custom RAG app vs the cost of using Copilot Studio, it's almost an order of magnitude lower (no matter how you cut it with the developer time and duration). 

My question is, it seems to me we are moving towards a situation where enterprise solutions will make custom RAG apps redundant (not in all cases of course, but most cases), however there seems to be very little discussion of this relative to the activity in the open source community.

My  key issue is: after making a request to the LLM there is often a long  delay for the model to produce the output and return, this can be  mitigated by streaming options, but are there any others? for example,  pre-tokenisation in the browser, prepared submissions, etc.

Sometimes chatgpt seems so fast to respond, just so fast, i'm interested if anybody knows of specific integration optimisations.

Any pointers welcome!"

Why not just use “small” (millions vs billion size) models that are specifically fine-tuned for these final tasks instead? Any benchmarks on how LLMs perform on these down stream tasks ? or it's just that smaller models are not as accessible as an OpenAPI is ?

I hear a lot from practitioners in the community the difficulty of LLM price tracking.

Counting tokens is deceptively hard. And it's challenging to know how much you're spending until after you look at your bills. 

So, we built an OSS token-price tracking library called Tokencost. Tokencost lets you easily calculate the estimated cost of an LLM call before you send a request to a major provider; this gives you a clearer picture on just how much you're spending. 

It's basically an updated price dictionary + cost calculator, all as a simple python library.

They find that GPT-4’s ratings agree as much with a human rater as a human annotator agrees with another one (>80%). Further, they observe that the agreement with a human annotator increases as the response rating gets clearer. Additionally, they investigated how much the evaluating LLM overestimated its responses and found that GPT-4 and Claude-1 were the only models that didn’t overestimate themselves.

Another general-purpose way to evaluate any LLM call is to measure how relevant the generated response is to the given query. But instead of using an LLM to rate the relevancy on a scale, the [**RAGAS: Automated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15217) paper suggests using an LLM to generate multiple questions that fit the generated answer and measure the cosine similarity of the generated questions with the original one.

Given that many API-based LLMs, such as GPT-4, don’t give access to the log probabilities of the generated tokens, assessing the certainty of LLM predictions via perplexity isn’t possible. The [**SelfCheckGPT: Zero-Resource Black-Box Hallucination Detection for Generative Large Language Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08896) paper suggests measuring the average factuality of every sentence in a generated response. They generate additional responses from the LLM at a high temperature and check how much every sentence in the original answer is supported by the other generations. The intuition behind this is that if the LLM knows a fact, it’s more likely to sample it. The authors find that this works well in detecting non-factual and factual sentences and ranking passages in terms of factuality. The authors noted that correlation with human judgment doesn’t increase after 4-6 additional generations when using gpt-3.5-turboto evaluate biography generations.

The [**LM vs LM: Detecting Factual Errors via Cross Examination**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13281) paper proposes using another LLM to assess an LLM response’s factuality. To do this, the examining LLM generates follow-up questions to the original response until it can confidently determine the factuality of the response. This method outperforms prompting techniques such as asking the original model, “Are you sure?” or instructing the model to say, “I don’t know,” if it is uncertain.

In its simplest form, a RAG application consists of retrieval and generation steps. The retrieval step fetches for context given a specific query. The generation step answers the initial query after being supplied with the fetched context.

The following is a collection of evaluation metrics to evaluate the retrieval and generation steps in an RAG application.

## [​](https://docs.parea.ai/blog/eval-metrics-for-llm-apps-in-prod#relevance-of-context-to-query)Relevance of Context to Query

For RAG to work well, the retrieved context should only consist of relevant information to the given query such that the model doesn’t need to “filter out” irrelevant information. The RAGAS paper suggests first using an LLM to extract any sentence from the retrieved context relevant to the query. Then, calculate the ratio of relevant sentences to the total number of sentences in the retrieved context.

Code: [**here**](https://github.com/parea-ai/parea-sdk-py/blob/main/parea/evals/rag/context_query_relevancy.py).

## [​](https://docs.parea.ai/blog/eval-metrics-for-llm-apps-in-prod#context-ranked-by-relevancy-to-query)Context Ranked by Relevancy to Query

Another way to assess the quality of the retrieved context is to measure if the retrieved contexts are ranked by relevancy to a given query. This is supported by the intuition from the [**Lost in the Middle paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172), which finds that performance degrades if the relevant information is in the middle of the context window. And that performance is greatest if the relevant information is at the beginning of the context window.

The RAGAS paper also suggests using an LLM to check if every extracted context is relevant. Then, they measure how well the contexts are ranked by calculating the mean average precision. Note that this approach considers any two relevant contexts equally important/relevant to the query.

Code: [**here**](https://github.com/parea-ai/parea-sdk-py/blob/main/parea/evals/rag/context_ranking_pointwise.py).

Instead of estimating the relevancy of every rank individually and measuring the rank based on that, one can also use an LLM to rerank a list of contexts and use that to evaluate how well the contexts are ranked by relevancy to the given query. The [**Zero-Shot Listwise Document Reranking with a Large Language Model**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02156) paper finds that listwise reranking outperforms pointwise reranking with an LLM. The authors used a progressive listwise reordering if the retrieved contexts don’t fit into the context window of the LLM.

Aman Sanger (Co-Founder at [**Cursor**](https://cursor.sh/)) mentioned ([**tweet**](https://twitter.com/amanrsanger/status/1732145826963828997)) that they leveraged this listwise reranking with a variant of the Trueskill rating system to efficiently create a large dataset of queries with 100 well-ranked retrieved code blocks per query. He underlined the paper’s claim by mentioning that using GPT-4 to estimate the rank of every code block individually performed worse.

Code: [**here**](https://github.com/parea-ai/parea-sdk-py/blob/main/parea/evals/rag/context_ranking_listwise.py).

## [​](https://docs.parea.ai/blog/eval-metrics-for-llm-apps-in-prod#faithfulness-of-generated-answer-to-context)Faithfulness of Generated Answer to Context

Once the relevance of the retrieved context is ensured, one should assess how much the LLM reuses the provided context to generate the answer, i.e., how faithful is the generated answer to the retrieved context?

One way to do this is to use an LLM to flag any information in the generated answer that cannot be deduced from the given context. This is the approach taken by the authors of [**Evaluating Correctness and Faithfulness of Instruction-Following Models for Question Answering**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16877). They find that GPT-4 is the best model for this analysis as measured by correlation with human judgment.

Code: [**here**](https://github.com/parea-ai/parea-sdk-py/blob/main/parea/evals/rag/answer_context_faithfulness_binary.py).

A classical yet predictive way to assess the faithfulness of a generated answer to a given context is to measure how many tokens in the generated answer are also present in the retrieved context. This method only slightly lags behind GPT-4 and outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo (see Table 4 from the above paper).

Code: [**here**](https://github.com/parea-ai/parea-sdk-py/blob/main/parea/evals/rag/answer_context_faithfulness_precision.py).

The RAGAS paper spins the idea of measuring the faithfulness of the generated answer via an LLM by measuring how many factual statements from the generated answer can be inferred from the given context. They suggest creating a list of all statements in the generated answer and assessing whether the given context supports each statement.

Code: [**here**](https://github.com/parea-ai/parea-sdk-py/blob/main/parea/evals/rag/answer_context_faithfulness_statement_level.py).

## [​](https://docs.parea.ai/blog/eval-metrics-for-llm-apps-in-prod#ai-assistant-chatbot-specific-evaluation-metrics)AI Assistant/Chatbot-Specific Evaluation Metrics

Typically, a user interacts with a chatbot or AI assistant to achieve specific goals. This motivates to measure the quality of a chatbot by counting how many messages a user has to send before they reach their goal. One can further break this down by successful and unsuccessful goals to analyze user & LLM behavior.

Concretely:

1. Delineate the conversation into segments by splitting them by the goals the user wants to achieve.
2. Assess if every goal has been reached.
3. Calculate the average number of messages sent per segment.

Code: [**here**](https://github.com/parea-ai/parea-sdk-py/blob/main/parea/evals/chat/goal_success_ratio.py).

## [​](https://docs.parea.ai/blog/eval-metrics-for-llm-apps-in-prod#evaluation-metrics-for-summarization-tasks)Evaluation Metrics for Summarization Tasks

Text summaries can be assessed based on different dimensions, such as factuality and conciseness.

## [​](https://docs.parea.ai/blog/eval-metrics-for-llm-apps-in-prod#evaluating-factual-consistency-of-summaries-w-rt-original-text)Evaluating Factual Consistency of Summaries w.r.t. Original Text

The [**ChatGPT as a Factual Inconsistency Evaluator for Text Summarization**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15621) paper used gpt-3.5-turbo-0301to assess the factuality of a summary by measuring how consistent the summary is with the original text, posed as a binary classification and a grading task. They find that gpt-3.5-turbo-0301outperforms baseline methods such as SummaC and QuestEval when identifying factually inconsistent summaries. They also found that using gpt-3.5-turbo-0301leads to a higher correlation with human expert judgment when grading the factuality of summaries on a scale from 1 to 10.

Code: [**binary classification**](https://github.com/parea-ai/parea-sdk-py/blob/main/parea/evals/summary/factual_inconsistency_binary.py) and [**1-10 grading**](https://github.com/parea-ai/parea-sdk-py/blob/main/parea/evals/summary/factual_inconsistency_scale.py).

## [​](https://docs.parea.ai/blog/eval-metrics-for-llm-apps-in-prod#likert-scale-for-grading-summaries)Likert Scale for Grading Summaries

Among other methods, the [**Human-like Summarization Evaluation with ChatGPT**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02554) paper used gpt-3.5-0301to evaluate summaries on a Likert scale from 1-5 along the dimensions of relevance, consistency, fluency, and coherence. They find that this method outperforms other methods in most cases in terms of correlation with human expert annotation. Noteworthy is that [**BARTScore**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11520) was very competitive to gpt-3.5-0301.

I'm not really well-versed in ML so I want to ask a few question on fine-tuning LLM if that's ok. I'm looking to fine tune some 7B models like llama or mistral 7B.

I'm trying to understand how to get an LLM to imitate someone, say Shakespeare. It's easy enough to get all of [Shakespeare's work](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/65).

If I've understood the current state of play for LLMs, there are three options:

* Fine tune an LLM
* Vectorize your knowledge using something like ChromaDB. Do a similarity search after each prompt and get the LLM to ""read"" the top n docs
* Do both

I have a feeling that to imitate Shakespeare, fine tuning an LLM might work best.

However, if my understanding is correct, the inputs to finetune an LLM must be formatted this way:

    <human>: ""To be""
    <system>: ""Or not to be""
The gap I'm having trouble bridging is how do I go from a large text file to this input format? The only idea I've come across is format all of the text like so:

    <human>: ""sentence_1""
    <system>: ""sentence_2""

    <human>: ""sentence_2""
    <system>: ""sentence_3""
Are there best practices around this problem? How should I be thinking about this?

I've seen companies like character.ai create bots that imitate [Elon Musk] (https://c.ai/c/6HhWfeDjetnxESEcThlBQtEUo0O8YHcXyHqCgN7b2hY) accurately for example so I know it's doable. I just wonder if they've done it by finetuning an LLM or training one from scratch or something else entirely."

I want GPT API (well, of course I hope to replace it with local model in 2024) to to write a code of a web scraper extraction logic (bs4 or cheerio for node.js) for a particular HTML page, for me.Honestly, most of the ""AI-powered web scrapers"" I've seen on the market in 2023 are just flashy landing pages with loud words that collect leads, or they only work on simple pages.

As far as I understand, the main problem is that the HTML document structure is a huge tree (sometimes with very significant nesting, if we are talking about real web pages - take a look at the Amazon product page, for example), which prevents you from using naive chunking algorithms to split this HTML document into smaller pieces so that ChatGPT can analyse it effectively - you need the whole HTML structure to fit into the context window of the LLM model, all the time.Another problem is that state-of-the-art LLMs with 100K+ token windows are still expensive (although they will become much more affordable over time).So my current (simplified) approach is:

1. Compress HTML heavily before passing it into GPT API
2. Ask GPT API to generate web scraper code, instead of passing each new web page into LLM again and again (this is not cost effective, and is \_very\_ slow)3. Automatically test the web scraper code and ask LLM to analyse the results over several (similar) web pages.

This works in my MVP with gpt-4-1106-preview model (no chance it could work with 16K tokens), but the real workflow which gives me acceptable results is much more complex than these 3 steps above, and involves multiple LLM passes and HTML document analysis, so I am wondering if I am inventing a bicycle here.

Do you see interesting projects and approaches in AI web scraping space recently?"
