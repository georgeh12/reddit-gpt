The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!  
The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

For those who work in NLP, you're probably familiar with ChatGPT - a powerful language model that can perform various natural language processing tasks. However, ChatGPT is not open-source, which limits its accessibility and customizability.

OpenChatKit, on the other hand, is an open-source alternative to ChatGPT that provides users with similar NLP capabilities while allowing for more customization and control. With OpenChatKit, users can train their own models and fine-tune them to their specific use cases.

In my article, I dive into the features of OpenChatKit, the Instruction-tuned Large Language Model, and the Limitations of the Model.

This is where [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [Deep Lake](https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake) come in, offering a powerful combination of technology to help build a question-answering tool based on financial data. After participating in a LangChain hackathon last week, I created a way to use Deep Lake, the data lake for deep learning (a package my team and I are building) with LangChain. I decided to put together a guide of sorts on how you can approach building your own question-answering tools with  LangChain and Deep Lake as the data store.

Read [the article](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/ultimate-guide-to-lang-chain-deep-lake-build-chat-gpt-to-answer-questions-on-your-financial-data/) to learn:

1. What is LangChain, what are its benefits and use cases and how you can use to streamline your LLM (Large Language Model) development?  
2. How to use [\#LangChain](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=langchain&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7037082545263448064) and [\#DeepLake](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=deeplake&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7037082545263448064) together to build [\#ChatGPT](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=chatgpt&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7037082545263448064) for your financial documents.  
3. How Deep Lake’s unified and streamable data store enables fast prototyping without the need to recompute embeddings (something that costs time & money).

I'm currently an intern at a company, and my mission is to make a proof of concept of an conversational AI for the company.They told me that the AI needs to be trained already but still able to get trained on the documents of the company, the AI needs to be open-source and needs to run locally so no cloud solution.

The AI should be able to answers questions related to the company, and tell the user which documents are pertained to their question, and also tell them which departement to contact to access those files.

For this they have a PC with an I7 8700K, 128Gb of DDR4 RAM and an Nvidia A2.

I already did some research and found some solution like localGPT and local LLM like vicuna etc, which could be usefull, but i'm really lost on how i should proceed with this task. (especially on how to train those model)

That's why i hope you guys can help me figure it out. If you have more questions or need other details don't hesitate to ask.

Thank you.

I wanted to give a sophisticated chatbot like ChatGPT a bunch of data and text from (for instance, not my end goal) a philosopher, and have it answer questions as if it was that philosopher, ague against what I say as if it was a person who believed what the text I gave it said and so on, all while still able to use online resources (like ChatGPT does) to find additional supporting information, rather than only the text I give it which might limit its ability to give coherent arguments. In summary, I want it's beliefs  and values to be limited to a specific source text, but not it's knowledge base.

How would I go about this? Do I have to develop a model from scratch to give it any text sources I want, or is it possible to do with an existing API? I was going to use Character.AI but the method for giving it information is too limited for what I want to do.

A group of researchers, around the YouTuber [Yannic Kilcher](https://www.ykilcher.com/), have announced that they are working on [Open Assistant](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant). The goal is to produce a chat-based language model that is much smaller than GPT-3 while maintaining similar performance.

If you want to support them, they are crowd-sourcing training data [here](https://open-assistant.io/).

**What Does This Mean?**

Current language models are too big.

They require millions of dollars of hardware to train and use. Hence, access to this technology is limited to big organizations. Smaller firms and universities are effectively shut out from the developments.

Shrinking and open-sourcing models will facilitate academic research and niche applications.

Projects such as Open Assistant will help to make language models a commodity. Lowering the barrier to entry will increase access and accelerate innovation.

Is SEO really dead? Or will it evolve? Back then I kept wondering if it’s true or not. Some believe SEO is dead, some don’t. But now with tools like Chat GPT and Midjourney, I think it’s time to take a look back and see how this might change SEO or if it will “kill” SEO.

I keep seeing threads and discussions seeing how people are excited and worried at the same time with how AI might be able to do a better job. But the way I see it, AI content still needs a person to tell it what to do and make the writing look nice. And also I think that the internet will have a lot of writing that was made by AI and that might change how we find things online. You might also see a ton of content being written by AI and trigger some plagiarism detectors and have a lot of websites get penalized. Hopefully the internet won’t be filled with boilerplate copy/pasted content coming from Chat GPT.

Well we have Google to filter out trash content anyway. But I know Google has some issues lately that they need to fix. One is that they also have AI that can help people find things on the internet with their search engine, and they need to make sure they are still the best in terms of search. 

The second is that Google needs to find a way to tell if something is really good or not, like how some websites that show art do. Google wants to show the best thing first, but it's hard because sometimes the thing that is the best is also something that Google's customers want people to see. It’s possible that some AI generated contentSo it's kind of tricky.

I have a feeling companies that already make SEO-writing and checking bots are gonna roll out some fresh new models soon. They're gonna be even better than before. These bots are going to write some good articles and product descriptions that are almost perfect. It almost looks like a human wrote the article or description. And all a human will do is quickly check for any false claims and write a headline that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it. 

We can only really tell 5-10 years from now. In the meantime, I’ll probably go back practicing some handyman skills and also go back teaching people how to drive and also be a service driver. These jobs I had in the past were way different from what I am earning now but if the worst comes to worst, at least I have these physical skills ready."

A few weeks ago, I was with a group of CTOs when someone asked: *does your company let your engineers use AI tools like Copilot or ChatGPT?*

I thought the question was strange. What do you mean *let*? They're going to use it no matter what you say. AI code generation tools offer engineers a huge productivity boost. The ability to autocomplete code in seconds or work through a problem with AI isn’t an opportunity developers will pass up.

When we drilled into why this group was reluctant to allow their engineers to use AI, it became apparent that their reservations centered primarily on one concern: the absence of a robust testing framework to give them confidence in the code generated by AI.

But this is still flawed reasoning. If you’re not confident in using AI, how can you be confident in hiring new grads? If you don’t have the tools to have confidence in your code, it doesn’t matter where that code comes from–you’ll always struggle with quality.

I got the funding for training, hardware, etc, and I want the end product to be on-premises, so no worries there. The inference doesn't have to be super fast either. I know there are projects like OpenAssistant and petals.ml but haven’t made enough research just yet.

One option I’m considering is using fine tuners like the one from [HuggingFace](https://github.com/subhasisj/HuggingFace-Transformers-FineTuning) or [Jina AI](https://github.com/jina-ai/finetuner) to fine-tune open source models like GPT-J or OPT to improve specific use-cases like code explanation. With the funding that we have, I wouldn’t want to cheap out on fine-tuning and expect something good.

I am speaking from the point of view of a data scientist not working in research.

Until now, learning NLP could be used to meet occasional business needs like sentiment analysis, text classification, topic modeling....

With the opening of GPT-3 to the public, the rise of ChatGPT, and the huge wave of applications, sites, plug-ins and extensions based on this technology that are accessible with a simple API request, it's impossible not to wonder if spending dozens of hours diving into this field if ML wouldn't be as useful today as learning the source code of the Pandas library. 

In some specialized cases, it could be useful, but GPT-3, and the models that will follow, seem to offer more than sufficient results for the immensity of the cases and for almost all classical NLP tasks. Not only that, but there is a good chance that the models trained by giants like Open-AI (Microsoft) or Google can never be replicated outside these companies anyway.  With ChatGPT and its incomparable mastery of language, its ability to code, summarize, extract topics, understand... why would I bother to use BERT or a TF-IDF vectorizer when an API will be released? Not only it would be easily accessible, but it also would be much better at the task, faster and cheaper.

In fact, it's a concern regarding all the machine learning field in general with the arrival of powerful ""no-code"" applications, which abstract a large part of the inherent complexity of the field. There will always be a need for experts, for safeguards, but in the end, won't the Data Scientist who masters the features of GPT-3 or 4 and knows a bit of NLP be more efficient than the one who has spent hours reading Google papers and practicing on Gensim, NLTK, spacy... It is the purpose of an API to make things simpler eventually... At what point is there no more reason to be interested in the behind-the-scenes of these tools and to become simple users rather than trying to develop our own techniques?"

This got me thinking. If if is indeed true that transformers are reaching peak performance, then what would the next model be? We are still nowhere near AGI simply because neural networks are just a very small piece of the puzzle. 

That being said, is it possible to get a pre-existing machine learning model to essentially create other machine learning models? I mean, it would still have its biases based on prior training but could perhaps the field of unsupervised learning essentially construct new models via data gathered and keep trying to create different types of models until it successfully self-creates a unique model suited for the task?

Its a little hard to explain where I'm going with this but this is what I'm thinking:

\- The model is given a task to complete.

\- The model gathers data and tries to structure a unique model architecture via unsupervised learning and essentially trial-and-error.

\- If the model's newly-created model fails to reach a threshold, use a loss function to calibrate the model architecture and try again.

\- If the newly-created model succeeds, the model's weights are saved.

This is an oversimplification of my hypothesis and I'm sure there is active research in the field of auto-ML but if this were consistently successful, could this be a new step into AGI since we have created a model that can create its own models for hypothetically any given task?

I'm thinking LLMs could help define the context of the task and perhaps attempt to generate a new architecture based on the task given to it but it would still fall under a transformer-based model builder, which kind of puts us back in square one."

Recently I got access to GPT4 and decided to try something a little peculiar: what if I asked it to generate hundreds of equations on topics that are relatively important but also less covered subjects for brainstorming reasons. I then asked GPT to grade the importance of every relation or even explain it.

I tried to make this practical for my own consumption but wanted to share in case someone has some good feedback or can find it useful. 

It’s interactive and settings are saved in the link. Recommended consumption on a desktop:

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were among the Algorithms to generate text. How RNNs generated text is by essentially predicting the next word given the previous few words. At one-stage RNNs were the hottest commodity one could have. But researchers were worried about 1 problem.

RNNs had a context-length problem. To understand what is context-length, consider an analogy. You started reading a book, it’s 100 pages long and when you read each page, details of previous pages start to get a little hazy. Haziness keeps on increasing to the point that when you reach page 50, you don’t remember anything from the first 5 pages. That is exactly what the problem is with RNNs.

To solve this, researchers developed another algorithm called the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and another variant called Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) which had a larger context-length than RNNs. Let’s get back to the book analogy. This time while reading, you are making notes. When you go ahead to a new page and your previous pages information start to get hazy, you look back at these notes to refresh your memory. It’s oversimplified, but that’s basically how an LSTM works.

LSTMs were not perfect. There were a number of new issues that came up in order to resolve the previous one. Meanwhile, other areas of research and technological advancements were heating up. Hardware was getting more and more prominent and with cloud getting popular, it was easily accessible. And on the research side, a new kind of Algorithm came up that shaped the entire NLP domain from here on - Attention Mechanism.

Attention Mechanism, as you might have guessed, is all about telling the more sophisticated algorithms where to “focus”. It’s the same way how we focus more on certain parts of the meeting we attend than the entire meeting itself. In context of NLP, the Mechanism became the core part for better algorithms. These better algorithms could keep larger context-lengths and at the time of predicting the next word, ask the Attention Mechanism about what to focus on while predicting the next word. This was an era-defining discovery in NLP as the algorithms that came up after this were the Transformers.

Consider jigsaw puzzles. You start by looking at all the pieces at once and join the pieces together. Initially, it is random. You join a couple of pieces at the top left corner, a few in the centre and a couple more defining the right edge. You are doing it all at once. Transformers basically work the same way. They could look at longer context-lengths, all at once, courtesy of Attention Mechanism. This means, they can not only work with a sentence, they can work with an entire paragraph.  With time, these Transformers started becoming more and more sophisticated. It eventually reached to a point that the only thing that was keeping these algorithms in handcuffs was the lack of data.

Until recently, these algorithms were trained on a specific data but when algorithms became too powerful, researchers started throwing every kind of data they could find on the internet easily. It could be articles like this, your social media posts, exam papers and solutions, and ebooks in any language they could find and hoped the algorithms learnt it all. And they were right. Algorithms started learning all of it to the point that you could ask models to explain concepts of LLMs in how Shakespeare would write and it would give a real-sounding responsive. These algorithms were Large! And hence, became known as Large Language Models (LLMs).

There we are now. With LLMs. OpenAI, technically, won the race for LLM development. They brought everybody’s attention to LLMs first with GPT-2, but GPT-3 was where shit hit the roof and every company that had deep pockets started investing in LLMs.  The result? We now have a new LLM getting released EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

He's going to present a few slides and then do a live demo of how to build an end-to-end ML application.

Then I've got 10 minutes or so to ask him anything I want.

**What would you ask him?**

Here's my working list of questions:

* Hugging Face is doing so many amazing things.  As an early ML practitioner or a student trying to break into ML, where would you recommend focusing your time if you want to understand how to apply Hugging Face tools in a hands-on way?  Are there any resources that you would recommend our audience check out first?
* What is your perspective on the difference between a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, and MLOps Engineer in today’s AI market?  What about at Hugging Face - how does your company make these distinctions?
* How do you think about what is actually happening to the underlying model when a general pre-trained transformer model - say, GPT-2 or GPT-3 - gets fine-tuned with unique text, image, speech, or time-series data?

Note:

Keep in mind that this guy is the real deal.  He wrote the book on Learning Amazon SageMaker (2nd edition last year) while he was a Principal Technical Evangelist for AWS.  Prior to joining AWS, Julien served for 10 years as CTO and VP of Engineering in large-scale web startups, and also wrote the first French-language Linux documentation back in 1992!"

Kaushik Rangadurai, ML Engineer at Facebook and I are leading a live, cohort based course on NLP starting March 14th. [https://corise.com/course/natural-language-processing](https://corise.com/course/natural-language-processing).

This is the second run of the class and we learned a lot from the feedback of the reddit community from the first run in November. Some of the changes we're making from the previous iteration:

1/ More focus on transformers and less on RNN/LSTM as hugging face is becoming the defacto for any nlp.

2/ Pytorch lightning has some really easy to use interfaces so better organizing the boiler plate code.

3/ OpenAI has opened the GPT-3 API so a deeper dive into current possibilities.

Would love to continue getting feedback and build this to be a great resource. The plan is to open the content after we refine it to a degree we're happy with. You can join the course (capped at about 30 students) at the link above. If you’re open to giving feedback on the class on how we can do better, happy to give a discount."

ChatGPT has passed the gold-standard exam required to practice medicine in the US

The artificial intelligence program scored 52.4 and 75 percent across the three-part Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE).

[**Google and Microsoft announced plans to incorporate AI into search engines.**](https://youtu.be/EBDJ9MGSV6k)

Google and Microsoft plan to incorporate AI into their search engines to change how people use the internet. Microsoft has announced that AI will soon allow conversations with its software and search engine Bing, while Google has announced similar plans.

As the most profitable software business is searching both companies are trying to take advantage of AI to rule the search engine market. 

[**Integrating the generative AI means a fivefold increase in Computing power & carbon emission.**](https://www.wired.com/story/the-generative-ai-search-race-has-a-dirty-secret/)

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into search engines could lead to a significant increase in the amount of energy that tech companies require and the amount of carbon they emit.

Training these models takes a huge amount of computational power, but only big tech companies can do so because they have the resources.

# 🔥Top 3 AI news in the past week

## 1. Expanding Language Horizons

Facebook has [released an open source model called MMS (Massively Multilingual Search)](https://research.facebook.com/publications/scaling-speech-technology-to-1000-languages/) for STT (speech to text), TTS (text to speech) and language identification. 

This is a big breakthrough. Currently, STT and TTS models recognize only 100 languages. With this the technology has been expanded to 1100 languages. That is 10x the current best. 

Additionally, these models can recognize 4000+ languages. 

As per Facebook, they also have half the error rate of OpenAI’s Whisper.

These guys are on a roll.

## 2. Bing Chat Enters the OS

After [Google’s announcement](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/week-google-ai-large-llm-gpt-plugin), it was time for Microsoft to announce AI products. Here’s a rundown of what was announced during Microsoft Build:

1. **Windows Copilot**  \- Microsoft is integrating AI directly into the OS. Now you can do everything you could do with Bing Chat but now on the OS. You can do the usual stuff - summarize emails, documents, re-write etc. But it goes beyond that by integrating into the installed applications.

Microsoft is also adopting OpenAI's plugin model. So, **you can use ChatGPT and Bing plugins to interact with the integrated AI.** 

The great thing about it is the direct integration into the OS. Eat your heart out, Mac users – at least for now 😀. Until Apple announces something similar. And someone will come up with an alternative solution. Especially, because of the privacy concerns with Microsoft telemetry. 

The bad thing is - [the security aspect of the plugins](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/caution-chatgpt-plugins). It can open a whole new attack vector on the OS and antivirus softwares might struggle with it. 

It also might be the second nail in the coffin for all the summarize, “talk to your document” apps. Once, this feature is integrated with [Google Docs](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/week-google-ai-large-llm-gpt-plugin) and Microsoft Office - why will you want to pay for extra apps?

## 3. From Trusted Advisor to Nightmare: The Hazards of Depending on AI

Here’s a [fun story which is breaking out on Legal twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html). 

A man filed a personal injury lawsuit against Avianca airlines. Avianca's lawyers wasted no time and requested the judge to dismiss the case. The man's lawyer had a different plan in mind. He submitted a document citing half a dozen cases that bolstered his client's claims.

Here's the twist—the judge and Avianca's lawyer couldn't locate any of the referenced cases. Quite a conundrum, right? The lawyer was then asked to provide copies of these elusive cases. The lawyer submitted screenshots as evidence, taking extra precautions to ensure their authenticity. 

You already know the direction this story is taking. 

The lawyer had used ChatGPT to compose his brief. But little did he know that ChatGPT had supplied him with fake cases.

When asked to file tangible copies of these cases, the lawyer turned to ChatGPT once again. ChatGPT had reassured him that the cases were genuine. Feeling emboldened, the lawyer used ChatGPT to provide the requested copies. He even went as far as incorporating chat screenshots into a legal document.

The lawyer maintains that it was never his intention to deceive the court. He expressed regret for relying on ChatGPT for their research. Unfortunately, the judge isn't pleased with this turn of events. The judge has threatened sanctions against both the lawyer and his firm.

It serves as a stark reminder of how ChatGPT has fooled many people. There is a clear warning stating that ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information. But many tend to overlook these warnings. Even legal professionals!!

This story carries significant importance for those who fear job insecurity. The lawyer and his firm could have prevented the entire debacle. They should've used paralegal services. They instead relied on ChatGPT's. It's a hard lesson learned the hard way.

My sincere hope is that this story serves as a valuable lesson. It helps people avoid making similar mistakes. The legal community might become apprehensive about ChatGPT's use moving forward.

# 🗞️10 AI news highlights and interesting reads

1. [OpenAI says in 10 years AI could be as productive as one of today’s large corporations](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence). This poses an existential risk and they suggest some regulations to manage it. This poses an existential risk and they suggest some regulations to manage it. To achieve this, countries need to form something like the [IAEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency). The IAEA is an intergovernmental agency under the UN to oversee nuclear energy. This “AI agency” will monitor the AI systems and conduct inspections. Just like nuclear energy is tracked through signatures, they suggest using compute and energy usage to track systems.
2. In the meantime, [Google is working on voluntary rules](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/24/eu-google-ai-pact/) until there are some real regulations in place.

4. Sharing prompts and results has been a pain. Taking screenshots is one way. But then everyone has to type in the prompts manually. Or you can share as plain text. But ChatGPT results are non-deterministic. So, the results might not be the same. Even the lawyer above would’ve loved this feature. Now you will be able to [share your ChatGPT conversations publicly](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7925741-chatgpt-shared-links-faq).
5. LLM Agents and plugins need to connect to tools to perform the tasks outside the LLM environment. So, it is important for the LLM to know which API to call and pass correct arguments. [Gorilla is a fine-tuned Llama-model which can generate the correct call and arguments](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/). 
6. If you are trying to build something beyond a document summarizer or a wrapper around GPT4 API, [things can be hard](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/hard-stuff-nobody-talks-about-llm).

I’m excited to introduce one-line wrappers for TensorFlow/Keras models that enable you to use TensorFlow models within scikit-learn workflows with features like Pipeline, GridSearch, and more.

[Swap in one line of code to use keras\/TF models with scikit-learn.](https://preview.redd.it/ulmww4ovwqma1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=6da7628298976fc3d72e771abe2546bbf32c1e0e)

Transformers are extremely popular for modeling text nowadays with GPT3, ChatGPT, Bard, PaLM, FLAN excelling for conversational AI and other Transformers like T5 & BERT excelling for text classification. Scikit-learn offers a broadly useful suite of features for classifier models, but these are hard to use with Transformers. However not if you use these wrappers we developed, which only require changing one line of code to make your existing Tensorflow/Keras model compatible with scikit-learn’s rich ecosystem!

All you have to do is swap `keras.Model` → `KerasWrapperModel`, or `keras.Sequential` → `KerasSequentialWrapper`. The wrapper objects have all the same methods as their keras counterparts, plus you can use them with tons of awesome scikit-learn methods.

You can find a demo jupyter notebook and read more about the wrappers here: [https://cleanlab.ai/blog/transformer-sklearn/](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/transformer-sklearn/)"

The thing that is troubling me as I learn more of the technical stuff, it seems that for a lot of language based NLP tasks, ChatGPT or these other foundation models seem SOTA for 99% of tasks. I was really excited to start training and working with BERT-based models, but find that a lot of the time I could get similar or better results just prompt engineering ChatGPT properly.

&#x200B;

So is it worth learning how to build and train these models? Or is my time really just better spent learning to use the APIs in effective ways like in RAG applications or in employing agents?

Unlike with CV and things like ControlNet, I don't see a lot of great applications of learning the technical stuff for someone who isn't a research scientist at a lab.

&#x200B;

**Energy as a constraint in ML model training:**

\- GPT-3, as an example, is estimated to have consumed around **936 MWh** during its training.  
\- If there were **$100B model training runs** in the future, it would consume approximately **20,347,826 MWh** or **20,347,826,000 KWh**.  
\- This would cost around **$1,017,391,300**, which is about **1%** of the total cost (assuming $0.05 KWh). The cost could go up to **$3B** if we assume $0.15 KWh.

&#x200B;

**Power generation comparison:**

\- One nuclear power plant can generate around **4,727,764 MWh** in a year.

&#x200B;

**Main constraints in massive model training runs apart from GPUs:**

\- Data movement through machines  
\- The amount of data that can be moved  
\- The amount of data the model has already been trained on  
\- Networking and bandwidth limitations  
\- System-specific bottlenecks  
\- Model training algorithm design (e.g., parallel processing, processing power requirements)

&#x200B;

**Potential $10T investment in ML models: Where would the money go?**

\- **17% ($1.7T)** \- Data collection, validation, and annotation  
\- **23% ($2.3T)** \- Research  
\- **60% ($6T)** \- Production (infrastructure, integration, maintenance)

&#x200B;

**Current and projected annual spend on GPUs:**  
\- **$40B** in 2022  
\- Projected to be **$400B** in 10 years

&#x200B;

I hope someone might find this information useful. It's definitely made me question the future impact as these models scale. As always, I'm open to corrections and eager to learn more. Let me know if you have any questions or additional insights."

I'm still working on It, but now I'm feeling comfortable with the variety and quality of the content. By the moment is a small repository with just 80 Stars.

My intention is to make the course more accessible to a wider audience, and, if possible, encourage  reporting any issues  encounter or suggesting improvements through the 'Discussion' section.

I'm eager to receive feedback.

Now, I'll provide an overview of the currently available content, and then I'll share a couple of questions I have about how to proceed with the course.

[Large Language Models Course: Learn by Doing LLM Projects.](https://github.com/peremartra/Large-Language-Model-Notebooks-Course)

* Introduction to LLM with OpenAI.
   * Create a first Chatbot using FPT 3.5.
   * Create a Natural Language to SQL Translator using OpenAI.
* Vector Databases with LLM.
   * Influencing Language Models with Information stored in ChromaDB.
* LangChain & LLM Apps.
   * RAG. Use the Data from Dataframes with LLMs.
   * Create a Moderation System using LangChain.
      * OpenAI.
      * GPT\_j.
      * LLama-2.
   * Create a Data Analyst Assistant using a LLM Agent.
* Evaluating LLMs
   * Evaluating Summarization with ROUGE.
* Fine-Tuning & Optimization.
   * Prompt-tuning using PEFT.
   * Fine-Tuning with LoRA.
   * Fine-Tuning a Large Model in a GPU using QLoRA. 

That's all for the moment, but I'm adding new content regularly. I'm working on it only in my spare time (mainly nights when the family goes to sleep).

\_\_\_

I have a doubt, I don't know if add some information about platforms like W&B or Cohere?  or maybe it is a better idea to stay with more Open-Source libraries?

On the other hand, my intention is to develop a couple of projects utilizing the techniques covered in the initial part of the course (which I am currently working on).

Some of these projects will be hosted in the cloud on major platforms such as Azure or GCP, or AWS. Any preference?

Furthermore, there is a plan to create a third section that explains how Large Language Models (LLMs) fit into large-scale enterprise solutions, defining architectures in which LLMs are used but are not the sole components of the project.

I don't intend to create a community outside of GitHub, but I would like the repository to have more activity and not be the one determining the course's direction.

Hope you like it, and lease, feel free to contribute.

This got me thinking. If if is indeed true that transformers are reaching peak performance, then what would the next model be? We are still nowhere near AGI simply because neural networks are just a very small piece of the puzzle. 

That being said, is it possible to get a pre-existing machine learning model to essentially create other machine learning models? I mean, it would still have its biases based on prior training but could perhaps the field of unsupervised learning essentially construct new models via data gathered and keep trying to create different types of models until it successfully self-creates a unique model suited for the task?

Its a little hard to explain where I'm going with this but this is what I'm thinking:

\- The model is given a task to complete.

\- The model gathers data and tries to structure a unique model architecture via unsupervised learning and essentially trial-and-error.

\- If the model's newly-created model fails to reach a threshold, use a loss function to calibrate the model architecture and try again.

\- If the newly-created model succeeds, the model's weights are saved.

This is an oversimplification of my hypothesis and I'm sure there is active research in the field of auto-ML but if this were consistently successful, could this be a new step into AGI since we have created a model that can create its own models for hypothetically any given task?

I'm thinking LLMs could help define the context of the task and perhaps attempt to generate a new architecture based on the task given to it but it would still fall under a transformer-based model builder, which kind of puts us back in square one."

The AI should be able to answers questions related to the company, and tell the user which documents are pertained to their question, and also tell them which departement to contact to access those files.

For this they have a PC with an I7 8700K, 128Gb of DDR4 RAM and an Nvidia A2.

I already did some research and found some solution like localGPT and local LLM like vicuna etc, which could be usefull, but i'm really lost on how i should proceed with this task. (especially on how to train those model)

That's why i hope you guys can help me figure it out. If you have more questions or need other details don't hesitate to ask.

SHouldn't AI models, or computers in general be able to do more advanced math than just crunching large numbers? Why haven't anyone used computers to solve any of the Millenium Prize Problems or some other difficult proof. 

GPT-4 and recently  Gemini, has decent enough grade school level math solving capabilities but absolute atrocious at solving slightly more complex problems. But, I guess thats to be expected since they're LLMs. But, why hasn't anyone built an AI model geared towards just solving mathemaths problems?

A few weeks ago, I was with a group of CTOs when someone asked: *does your company let your engineers use AI tools like Copilot or ChatGPT?*

I thought the question was strange. What do you mean *let*? They're going to use it no matter what you say. AI code generation tools offer engineers a huge productivity boost. The ability to autocomplete code in seconds or work through a problem with AI isn’t an opportunity developers will pass up.

When we drilled into why this group was reluctant to allow their engineers to use AI, it became apparent that their reservations centered primarily on one concern: the absence of a robust testing framework to give them confidence in the code generated by AI.

But this is still flawed reasoning. If you’re not confident in using AI, how can you be confident in hiring new grads? If you don’t have the tools to have confidence in your code, it doesn’t matter where that code comes from–you’ll always struggle with quality.

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!  
The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

Patrick, you failed again. Sandy! \[starts knocking on the door, and Sandy comes in\]

Look, I really am sorry for everything I did. \[hanging onto the barrel, shoving it down, and then banging on it\]

Not only that, but you showed up late for work? \[crying\]

My brain was working all night to make up for the hours I wasted on making up so much cheese.

\[hanging on the barrel, then suddenly appearing\] Patrick, what are you...

\[Patrick turns around, and looks at him for his failure\] Sandy? \[crying\]

I know what you did to me brain. \[turns around, and runs off the barrel. Sandy comes in again\]

Oh, Patrick, I got you something. \[takes the nut off of SpongeBobs head\]

Thats it. \[takes the nut from SpongeBobs foot\] Thats it. \[takes the nut off his face. He chuckles, then sighs\]

Thats the last nut I got. \[walks away\] Patrick, maybe you can come back later.

Oh, sure, Im coming with you. \[hangs up the barrel. Sandy walks into SpongeBobs house\] \[annoyed\]

Nonsense, buddy. You let Gary go and enjoy his nice days alone. \[puts her hat on her head\]

You promise me? \[she pulls it down, revealing a jar of chocolate\]

You even let me sleep with you? \[she opens the jar, and a giggle plays\]

Oh, Neptune, that was even better than that jar of peanut chocolate I just took. \[she closes the door, and Gary walks into his house, sniffles\]

Gary? \[opens the jar\] \[screams, and spits out the peanut chocolate\]

Gary?! \[SpongeBob gets up, desperate, and runs into his house, carrying the jar of chocolate. Gary comes back up, still crying\]

SpongeBob! \[SpongeBob sees the peanut chocolate, looks in the jar, and pours it in a bucket. Then he puts his head in the bucket and starts eating the chocolate. Gary slithers towards SpongeBobs house, still crying\]

I need help fixing that.**

&#x200B;

A short backstory.

We learned Java in class in my first year of college. (starting my 3rd year soon) I loved it, wanted to learn Python too. Did a tutorial and left it at that. 1 year later (which is a few months ago), I got interested in ML. Watched some Statquest, did a few simple projects like Titanic. I've been doing ML for about 2-3 months now. Not every day. Maybe 10 days a month on average.  


The problem is, I can't code it on my own. I almost always ask ChatGPT what I want to do, it spits out some code. I get a few errors, try to fix it. ***Voila, the project is finished.***

I'm tired of feeling like a fraud, I don't want to copy paste ChatGPT's code. It doesn't feel like it's my own. I know what I want to do, maybe 30% of the time I know how the code should be structured, but have no idea how to write it.

Even for the most basic things, like drawing a matplotlib plot, I need a little help. Writing code for a linear regression from Scikit is impossible to do without help.

I don't know what the code I copy paste even means most of the time. I just leave it because it works.

For example:

`forpass['location_x'] = forpass['location'].str.split(',', expand=True)[0].str.strip()`   
I have no idea what this code means, it works, does what I need it to do so I leave it.

How can I fix this? I feel like it's impossible for me to remember the syntax, and the necessary structure for my code. How the hell am I supposed to remember all this? I feel like I will never be able to.

&#x200B;

I'd appreciate the help"

I have some experience with coding video game AI in Godot, Unity and Unreal but I've never touched ML or ""real""(?) AI that uses learning algorithms. 

&#x200B;

I wanted to give a sophisticated chatbot like ChatGPT a bunch of data and text from (for instance, not my end goal) a philosopher, and have it answer questions as if it was that philosopher, ague against what I say as if it was a person who believed what the text I gave it said and so on, all while still able to use online resources (like ChatGPT does) to find additional supporting information, rather than only the text I give it which might limit its ability to give coherent arguments. In summary, I want it's beliefs  and values to be limited to a specific source text, but not it's knowledge base. 

&#x200B;

How would I go about this? Do I have to develop a model from scratch to give it any text sources I want, or is it possible to do with an existing API? I was going to use Character.AI but the method for giving it information is too limited for what I want to do. 

&#x200B;

If anyone has any resources to get me started it would be very helpful! Thank you."

I'm not sure. The organic brain grows over time in early childhood, making more room for more connections as the organism gains more experiences. GPTs and most other neural networks are pre-trained and then experience only minor fine-tuning.

But what if we upscale the neural network to make more room for new connections? Basically, what if we increase the size of the weight tensor and then use something like Gaussian interpolation to smooth out the weights? 

The process seems to work alright, based on the [testing I've done](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369998746_Organic_Growth_of_GPT_Models_A_Brain-Inspired_Incremental_Model_Scaling_Approach), but it might just be due to some weird error that I get decent results. Of course, we wouldn't use this process to train a general use LLM. This process would result in a very unique neural network with its own connections based on its own experiences and self directed learning, i.e they'd be much more like organic minds that ""grew up"" over time.

If this process is viable I'd imagine there'd already be something on the topic of model/network upscaling, but I'm not seeing anything."

AI, such as bard and gpt are fun to chat with. They can help build ideas and help motivate you to be something. (the picture is almost finished, then my question.)  
As you can guess, I'm alone, a solo person. I'm okay with that, i'm not lonely, just alone.  


That being said, I see a ton of apps with 'ai"" in the andriod\\ios app stores.  
I never tried it cause honestly I dont think, ""Dating AI girlfriends"" is really a good use for AI.  
I'm not that alone. and ALL my information is and should be considered, ""or so I was told"" cause I cant say I know for sure. So forgive my misinformation.  
My question is, Ai learns from analog learning. I'm not looking for companion apps, but other ways one can program AI to help it teach us? Can there be ways to program AI to do particular things?   


on of the major things I use Bard for is to help come up with ideas. Collaborate with me, to tell me yes, this works, or no it doesnt. Is there a way to make AI that can help people achieve peace? To address the masses, with solutions for issues that we humans are able to help one another for a peaceful solution? Maybe an educational ai to help targeted youth to learn better? They cant afford school, can an AI be a teacher for less fortunate students?  
Google bard, GPT and I spend the last 3 days coming up with a plan to allow a man in a chair with a computer to help many people struggling. We came up with a poem.

The thing that is troubling me as I learn more of the technical stuff, it seems that for a lot of language based NLP tasks, ChatGPT or these other foundation models seem SOTA for 99% of tasks. I was really excited to start training and working with BERT-based models, but find that a lot of the time I could get similar or better results just prompt engineering ChatGPT properly.

&#x200B;

So is it worth learning how to build and train these models? Or is my time really just better spent learning to use the APIs in effective ways like in RAG applications or in employing agents?

Unlike with CV and things like ControlNet, I don't see a lot of great applications of learning the technical stuff for someone who isn't a research scientist at a lab.

I am speaking from the point of view of a data scientist not working in research.

Until now, learning NLP could be used to meet occasional business needs like sentiment analysis, text classification, topic modeling....

With the opening of GPT-3 to the public, the rise of ChatGPT, and the huge wave of applications, sites, plug-ins and extensions based on this technology that are accessible with a simple API request, it's impossible not to wonder if spending dozens of hours diving into this field if ML wouldn't be as useful today as learning the source code of the Pandas library. 

In some specialized cases, it could be useful, but GPT-3, and the models that will follow, seem to offer more than sufficient results for the immensity of the cases and for almost all classical NLP tasks. Not only that, but there is a good chance that the models trained by giants like Open-AI (Microsoft) or Google can never be replicated outside these companies anyway.  With ChatGPT and its incomparable mastery of language, its ability to code, summarize, extract topics, understand... why would I bother to use BERT or a TF-IDF vectorizer when an API will be released? Not only it would be easily accessible, but it also would be much better at the task, faster and cheaper.

In fact, it's a concern regarding all the machine learning field in general with the arrival of powerful ""no-code"" applications, which abstract a large part of the inherent complexity of the field. There will always be a need for experts, for safeguards, but in the end, won't the Data Scientist who masters the features of GPT-3 or 4 and knows a bit of NLP be more efficient than the one who has spent hours reading Google papers and practicing on Gensim, NLTK, spacy... It is the purpose of an API to make things simpler eventually... At what point is there no more reason to be interested in the behind-the-scenes of these tools and to become simple users rather than trying to develop our own techniques?"

**\*\*\* Global Inputs \*\*\***

1) I am adult learner. 37 y.o. Content writer and professional English tutor.

2) I am pivoting completely into ""Sales/Marketing in ML/AI/AI-tech/AI-SaaS/AI-dev-agencies"".

3) I don't understand completely what ""Sales/Marketing in ML/AI/AI-tech/AI-SaaS/AI-dev-agencies"" means, but it means the following:

a. **I want completely pivot into the AI-driven tech** \- that's for sure. I see a lot of potential there, and I can see that I'll be able to gradually move into sales and start making the good money (the good money for me is 2K/mo, coz I am located in Kurplastan, but I want to move Bankok in 12 months; I am originally a russky).

b. **I am learning Python -** doing a basic course. It's going well. I have the core insights into HTML, CSS, JS, React, rest api, node, etc.

c. **I am not planning to become an actual ML Engineer -** but I want to move into sales/marketing in AI tech.

d. **I am not fixated on AI either** \- whenever I start making mone, I'm going to start pushing the surplus into ecommerce (there's a lot of opportunities to make money there, folks; don't look down on that; you can be making a lot of money there if you are learning and act strategically!)

4) I had huge problems with math and other STEM subjects in school - I wasn't getting them, and I was passing by them.

**\*\*\* Question Inputs \*\*\***

1) I decided that I would start the pivot 5 days ago, and THEN I started googling around what ML actuall is. I had a vague understanding that there's some math in it, but I decided to go blind... Now, I am understanding that I need to understand the basics of math.

2) I freaked out big time, I am almost started smoking after 7 years of not smoking...

3) Then I said to myself - Idk, I am not going anywhere, and I started doing this course - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuwofNeT9ok&list=PLybg94GvOJ9FoGQeUMFZ4SWZsr30jlUYK&index=34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuwofNeT9ok&list=PLybg94GvOJ9FoGQeUMFZ4SWZsr30jlUYK&index=34). (If you are looking for a good introduction math course, most of the people who I talk to always say that this is an amazing course. Really. I am at lesson 33 and I am loving every second of it.)

**\*\*\* Question \*\*\***

**1) Huge speed reduction at Lesson 34**: Now I am at Lesson 34 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuwofNeT9ok&list=PLybg94GvOJ9FoGQeUMFZ4SWZsr30jlUYK&index=34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuwofNeT9ok&list=PLybg94GvOJ9FoGQeUMFZ4SWZsr30jlUYK&index=34). I watched the video today, didn't understand anything at all, as it turns out. Then I was presented with this compherension check - [https://imgsh.net/a/eKp1MAa.png](https://imgsh.net/a/eKp1MAa.png). I realized that I don't even understand what is wanted from me. I got super frustrated, but not desparate or fleeing. Then I realized that I don't understand what is wanted from me, so I started googling the concept of ""factoring the quadratics"". Importantly, I started GPTing and Gooling the ""why"". I know... This is a very important point for me - I always need to understand the ""why"" behind a tool. I learned that it would be easier for charting in linalg. OK! This was the answer. Then, i realized that I actualy didn't understand the lesson, so I found this article - [https://www.mashupmath.com/blog/how-to-factor-polynomials](https://www.mashupmath.com/blog/how-to-factor-polynomials). I read it end to end, understood everything, practiced every task 3 times and I do really understand how to fator the quadractics by now!

**2) Speed reduction is a normal thing**: So, prior to lesson 34, I was doing like 7 lessons per day. This was a good lesson - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-5DKCLJspM&list=PLybg94GvOJ9FoGQeUMFZ4SWZsr30jlUYK&index=13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-5DKCLJspM&list=PLybg94GvOJ9FoGQeUMFZ4SWZsr30jlUYK&index=13). I really liked it :) I can see that the speed reduction is occurring because of the complexity increase. It's not occurring because I am lost and disoriented - I remember how that felt in school, when you see a bunch of numbers on the blackboard and have no freaking idea what's going on there. I am just hitting up my best friend GPT and ask, ask, ask, ask stupid questions. Thus, I can see that the speed reduction is a normal right, right?

**3) Wha's the optimal speed correction here**: So, I am allocating 7h/d during the daytime shift when I am in the prime state toward this project. And I don't even have to learn Python at all because Python is easy, but I do plan to keep learning PYthon with 3 sessions each for 30 minutes so that I don't just do math. (And I run English lessons in the evenings so that I can keep on making money).

**The actual question**

I am thinking that I should go down from the goal of 7 lessons per day down to 3 lessons per day, right? If I do this, then I'm going to end up with the forecast delivery period of 43 days, right?

And the information that I provided above was kinda like an explanatory note that I am trying to become a real ML engineer, but I want to graudally slide into sales and marketing so that I can TOO Make a lot of money, uknow.

What do you think about the speed reduction down to 3 lessons per day?"

For those who work in NLP, you're probably familiar with ChatGPT - a powerful language model that can perform various natural language processing tasks. However, ChatGPT is not open-source, which limits its accessibility and customizability.

OpenChatKit, on the other hand, is an open-source alternative to ChatGPT that provides users with similar NLP capabilities while allowing for more customization and control. With OpenChatKit, users can train their own models and fine-tune them to their specific use cases.

In my article, I dive into the features of OpenChatKit, the Instruction-tuned Large Language Model, and the Limitations of the Model.

Hi, I’m currently a 3rd year software engineering student, and a frontend engineer in work.

Seeing all the recent advancements in machine learning and ai in general (especially with chatGPT), I think it is inevitable to learn how everything works and how to develop in this field.

I have some good knowledge of programming, system architecture and computer science fundamentals.  As well as decent knowledge on various programming languages, algorithms and design patterns.

My question is, where can I start to learn ML the fastest way possible, knowing already a lot about python and programming in general?

Where can I learn only what’s necessary for developing a product for the industry in ML? (if it’s possible to skip all the theoretical stuff)

Also, Is statistics really that necessary for industry work? I have some decent knowledge about math from university but in real life I rarely use linear algebra or calculus in work (since I don’t do graphics or anything related to that)."

Is SEO really dead? Or will it evolve? Back then I kept wondering if it’s true or not. Some believe SEO is dead, some don’t. But now with tools like Chat GPT and Midjourney, I think it’s time to take a look back and see how this might change SEO or if it will “kill” SEO.

I keep seeing threads and discussions seeing how people are excited and worried at the same time with how AI might be able to do a better job. But the way I see it, AI content still needs a person to tell it what to do and make the writing look nice. And also I think that the internet will have a lot of writing that was made by AI and that might change how we find things online. You might also see a ton of content being written by AI and trigger some plagiarism detectors and have a lot of websites get penalized. Hopefully the internet won’t be filled with boilerplate copy/pasted content coming from Chat GPT.

Well we have Google to filter out trash content anyway. But I know Google has some issues lately that they need to fix. One is that they also have AI that can help people find things on the internet with their search engine, and they need to make sure they are still the best in terms of search. 

The second is that Google needs to find a way to tell if something is really good or not, like how some websites that show art do. Google wants to show the best thing first, but it's hard because sometimes the thing that is the best is also something that Google's customers want people to see. It’s possible that some AI generated contentSo it's kind of tricky.

I have a feeling companies that already make SEO-writing and checking bots are gonna roll out some fresh new models soon. They're gonna be even better than before. These bots are going to write some good articles and product descriptions that are almost perfect. It almost looks like a human wrote the article or description. And all a human will do is quickly check for any false claims and write a headline that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it. 

We can only really tell 5-10 years from now. In the meantime, I’ll probably go back practicing some handyman skills and also go back teaching people how to drive and also be a service driver. These jobs I had in the past were way different from what I am earning now but if the worst comes to worst, at least I have these physical skills ready."

I am working on a project whose ultimate goal is to be able to chat with a chatbot that after a natural language request returns specific calls to library functions that implement calls to a tool's API.

A bit more into details: I have a tool that can be used by calling its HTTP API. In order to make these calls, I have built a library on top of the API, so as to simplify the calls and make them easier to use. I would like to have a chatbot whose model is trained on the library itself, so that, given a natural language request as input, it returns its translation into the library language. 

My first idea was to use OpenAI API service as a wrapper and eventually try other models in the future if I find a better and/or cheaper custom way to implement the chatbot.

My doubts are mainly 2:
1. Fine-tuning: which is the best way to fine-tune the OpenAI model for this use case?

2. Well formatted calls: how to avoid the chatbot from returning non-existing method calls or classes and stick with what is available in the library?

Any other suggestion outside the scope of the doubts are more than welcome.
Thank you very much in advance for every guy that will read the post."

Background: I studied Cognitive Science, which included some Calculus and data structures in Computer Science. I'm not the MOST technical person there is, but I can comprehend concepts that tap into advanced computer science domains.

1. Google is dominant in online searching. Despite sustained efforts by companies with platform advantages, including Microsoft and Apple (Bing and Siri) attempting to make their search engines better, Google seems far and away the most preferred search engine worldwide.

2. Meanwhile... They seem to admit internally that GenAI isn't a race that they can sustainably win (https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither). The have no moat in this.

What is the technical cause of this?

I'm unfamiliar with the technical reasons for why they're so much better in search, but ChatGPT seems to think it's due to their data advantage and focus on user experience. But I'm still not sure why that cannot be overcome. Is search technology much more reliant on one aspect of tech infrastructure that cannot be overcome by other companies, whereas LLMs are dependent on open-source tech and data, and thus can be improved upon easily?

Is deep learning why they're so much better?"

I've been building my own ""personal assistant"" using the GPT API and Eleven Labs, and I am finally getting to the fine-tuning portion of everything. That being said, I have been primarily working with fine-tuning GPT directly through the OpenAI documentation, finding some success, but nothing too amazing quite yet.

&#x200B;

That being said, I was pointed to [ChatBase](https://www.chatbase.co/), a website that trains GPT on your data. I am assuming many of you have seen it, but the point is you can put documents, text, Q&A's, and web data which it will then train GPT on. The results are quite good with proper data, but it really doesn't require much to produce results.  


I imagine that they are using the same fine tuning techniques, but I question how they are able to produce such fantastic results with such little information. Perhaps there is something I am missing in the documentation? Does anybody know how one might be able to achieve similar results to a custom ChatBase model through their own GPT fine-tuning data set?"

I've been delving deep into chatbots lately, especially with the ChatGPT API, and I found an issue that's probably familiar to many of you: ChatGPT doesn't inherently have memory capabilities. For many applications, that's perfectly fine, but for those of us who are trying to create a more context-aware and dynamic conversation flow, this limitation is quite apparent.

I faced this challenge in one of my projects and realized that there had to be a better way to integrate context and memory into ChatGPT's conversations. So, I built something for myself which I thought might be useful for many of you as well. Allow me to introduce you to [**Memorybase.io**](http://memorybase.io/).

Memorybase is a developer-friendly API that's designed to seamlessly integrate memory functionality into the ChatGPT API. By harnessing the power of the Pinecone vector database and LangChain, Memorybase wraps around the ChatGPT API and ensures that the right context and memory are injected into each query. This means that your chatbot can remember previous interactions, preferences, or any other context that's relevant for more engaging and meaningful conversations.

Imagine a user asking your chatbot about movie recommendations. The next day, they come back and reference that conversation, expecting the bot to remember. With Memorybase, that continuity becomes possible. The user experience improves manifold, and the possibilities for more sophisticated and context-aware bots increase tremendously.

I originally built Memorybase for my own needs. But the more I used it, the more I realized that this could have broader applications. Any developer looking to leverage the ChatGPT API could potentially benefit from the enhanced memory and context capabilities. From customer support bots to interactive storytelling, the potential use cases are vast.

This technology stack (pinecone/langchain) is not complex or ‘new’ per se, but for application developers who aren’t interested in managing it or hosting it, this could be a useful hassle-free option for your projects.

I've set up a page over at [memorybase.io](https://memorybase.io/) where you can learn more about how it works and see if it aligns with your needs. I would love for you to check it out and share your thoughts. Your feedback, insights, and potential use cases would be invaluable as I continue to refine and expand the capabilities of Memorybase.

Thanks for reading, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts and see where Memorybase can fit into the exciting world of chatbots!"

At one-stage RNNs were the hottest commodity one could have. But researchers were worried about 1 problem.

RNNs had a context-length problem. To understand what is context-length, consider an analogy. You started reading a book, it’s 100 pages long and when you read each page, details of previous pages start to get a little hazy. Haziness keeps on increasing to the point that when you reach page 50, you don’t remember anything from the first 5 pages. That is exactly what the problem is with RNNs.

To solve this, researchers developed another algorithm called the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and another variant called Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) which had a larger context-length than RNNs. Let’s get back to the book analogy. This time while reading, you are making notes. When you go ahead to a new page and your previous pages information start to get hazy, you look back at these notes to refresh your memory. It’s oversimplified, but that’s basically how an LSTM works.

LSTMs were not perfect. There were a number of new issues that came up in order to resolve the previous one. Meanwhile, other areas of research and technological advancements were heating up. Hardware was getting more and more prominent and with cloud getting popular, it was easily accessible. And on the research side, a new kind of Algorithm came up that shaped the entire NLP domain from here on - Attention Mechanism.

Attention Mechanism, as you might have guessed, is all about telling the more sophisticated algorithms where to “focus”. It’s the same way how we focus more on certain parts of the meeting we attend than the entire meeting itself. In context of NLP, the Mechanism became the core part for better algorithms. These better algorithms could keep larger context-lengths and at the time of predicting the next word, ask the Attention Mechanism about what to focus on while predicting the next word. This was an era-defining discovery in NLP as the algorithms that came up after this were the Transformers.

Consider jigsaw puzzles. You start by looking at all the pieces at once and join the pieces together. Initially, it is random. You join a couple of pieces at the top left corner, a few in the centre and a couple more defining the right edge. You are doing it all at once. Transformers basically work the same way. They could look at longer context-lengths, all at once, courtesy of Attention Mechanism. This means, they can not only work with a sentence, they can work with an entire paragraph.  With time, these Transformers started becoming more and more sophisticated. It eventually reached to a point that the only thing that was keeping these algorithms in handcuffs was the lack of data.

Until recently, these algorithms were trained on a specific data but when algorithms became too powerful, researchers started throwing every kind of data they could find on the internet easily. It could be articles like this, your social media posts, exam papers and solutions, and ebooks in any language they could find and hoped the algorithms learnt it all. And they were right. Algorithms started learning all of it to the point that you could ask models to explain concepts of LLMs in how Shakespeare would write and it would give a real-sounding responsive. These algorithms were Large! And hence, became known as Large Language Models (LLMs).

There we are now. With LLMs. OpenAI, technically, won the race for LLM development. They brought everybody’s attention to LLMs first with GPT-2, but GPT-3 was where shit hit the roof and every company that had deep pockets started investing in LLMs.  The result? We now have a new LLM getting released EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

I've been really amazed with ChatGTP-3 and ChatGTP-4 and started thinking how I can use them in my own company. I'd love to train something based on all of our previous tickets. The issue is, these tickets contain sensitive information and customer data, so I can't use some cloud based API. 

So let's say Bob is an excellent worker. His tickets are the gold standard, he always writes in a professional voice with detailed information. There's 20 different issues we fix as part of our business, and over the past 3 years, Bob has covered all of them 100 times over. 

So, I'd like to export all of the tickets Bob has worked and use them to train some GTP/AI type model. I'd like to be able to write a prompt like 'For Issue A with these variables, write up an issue description for our customer"" 

I've been trying to wrap my head around this, but it's an awfully overwhelming subject. Talking with GTP-4 it looks like I can try either GTP-2 or DistilGTP. I also came across Llama.cpp which just came out the other day it seems. 

With this in mind, I've got a few questions

1. Is there any option I should consider that lets me run this on something with 32 gigs of ram and 8 to 16 cores? I've got access to a few pieces of hardware. Again, so far I'm looking at DistilGTP, GTP-2, or llama.cpp
2. Will I need other data sets if I ever figure out how to train this on Bob's tickets? Or will that be enough? I'm trying to figure out if I need the several hundred gigs of other models out there. 
3. How the heck do I go about getting started? :) If someone can help me narrow things down to which LLM (if that's even the right term) I should use to accomplish my goals, and some basic instructions on how to train the data, I think I can figure out the rest after a few thousand rounds of trial and error.

IT is a very long conversation, i apologize. Also its missing the initial conversation i had with Bing chat (this is why i suddenly know how neurons work, that part is basically the culmination of the bing chat it all started with..). As far as i can tell there is no way to access previous bing chats again...


Now, theres propably some errors in it, but what i want to know is, is this a viable approach, is the picture it created in my head accurate enough to at least have somewhat of an opinion about things?

remember, before i talked to it I had no idea about how LLMs actually work. I had heard of parameters of transformer, of neurons but that was about it, I didnt knew what these words actually stood for.


Now mind you, my goal wasnt to get a deep scientific understanding so that i can build my own models. I wanted to end up with a valid general overview of the technology so that i can build somehwat(!) of an imformed opinion about what is about to come. Would you say this ended up successfully?

im also trying to assess how valuable this process is for other things i diont know yet. Will I / Can I in the future just talk to the bot for a few hours to get an understanding of $new instead of googling and sifting through crap?

Professional Looking for Guidance.,Pan4TheSwarm,False,1.0,11,16y5bko,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/16y5bko/whats_the_field_of_mlai_look_like_professional/,13,1696273754.0,"Let me start out this post by saying I'm feeling a little unsure of my professional ambitions right now and looking for some guidance from the community. I have a bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, focusing on embedded systems and RF communication systems. Additionally I have dedicated my time out of school studying the field of software engineering through books. My specialties are C/C++, with some Python mixed in here and there. Professionally, I'm working in C++ on IoT technologies and custom RF hardware. I have a solid background in mathematics from my studies. I've also had some interest in socio-linguisitcs. 

A couple weeks ago, I started playing around with ChatGPT, and I was insanely impressed. My ADHD brain got hyperfocused and needed to learn more. I've been diving into the world of ML/AI since. I've been playing around with hosting LLaMA models locally (running painfully slow on my 6800XT), and reading up on machine learning since. 

I don't know how far my interest goes at this point, but right now my interest is very strong. I'm trying to determine if my interest is in dabbling with ML/AI, or if I want to pivot my professional career towards ML/AI. Honestly, I'm not sure at this moment and here's where I am looking for some more perspective to help gauge my interests.

I asked ChatGPT for resources to look into. I tend to be a book learner, so I focused on the book recommendations. They recommended ""Python Machine Learning"" by Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili; ""Deep Learning"" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville; and ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"" by Christopher M. Bishop. 

I love me my kindle samples, and I figured an applications book would be good for me at this stage, so I picked up ""Python Machine Learning"". I'm enjoying the book, but after reading it for some time, I'm starting to contemplate if I should be instead going down a learning path geared towards a more professional placement. I read a [A Super Harsh Guide to Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5z8110/d_a_super_harsh_guide_to_machine_learning/), and noticed their recommendations were more 'academic' in nature (""Deep Learning"" is on their list). Its making me second guess where I put my time, but it all depends on what I want my desired outcome to be, and frankly I'm still not sure. 

I'm also looking for a good point to enter grad school for a Masters. Maybe I want to go into ML and NLP? Do I need to be looking at a PhD for this field (which, I wouldn't mind pursuing)? 

There isn't a distinct question here, so I'm sorry about that. I'm looking for perspective, and guidance for the field so I can determine how I want to pursuit my interest in this area. Should I continue with ""Python Machine Learning""? Or should I follow the Super Harsh Guide more closely? "

How many days did it take to train the GPT-3 model? From the above table it says that it took 3640 days of training for GPT-3. That is 9.97 years. Am I right?

If then how did they train the model for a company that was setup 5 years ago? Is training a neural net model a parallelizable task for them to train on many GPUs in parallel and reduce the time needed to train? In my opinion optimising the weights cannot be a parallelizable task as each weight have to be optimised step by step slowly through each back-propagation. Each weight will reach the optimum value only by changing it's value little by little in sequential order. So it cannot be a parrallelizable task. Am I right?

I'd love to hear your thoughts:

Vinyl Chloride spilled in East Palestine, Ohio about 300 miles away from Cincinnati. The chemical leaked into the Ohio River. How long will it take for the chemical to reach the water supply of Cincinnati which is also on the Ohio River?

The time it will take for Vinyl Chloride to reach Cincinnati's water supply from the spill site in East Palestine, Ohio will depend on several factors such as the amount of Vinyl Chloride spilled, the concentration of the chemical in the river, the flow rate of the river, and any barriers or dams along the river that may affect the movement of the chemical.

Assuming there are no significant barriers or dams along the river, the average flow rate of the Ohio River is approximately 1.5 miles per hour. Therefore, if the spill occurred in East Palestine, Ohio, which is 300 miles upstream from Cincinnati, it could take up to 200 hours (300 miles / 1.5 miles per hour) for the Vinyl Chloride to reach Cincinnati's water supply.

However, it is important to note that the actual time for the chemical to reach Cincinnati's water supply could be longer or shorter depending on the specific conditions of the spill and the river. It's also possible that officials may take steps to prevent the chemical from reaching the water supply, such as by diverting the river or shutting off water intake valves, in order to protect public health and safety.

The goal of the tutorial is to have those with little experience coding, little experience with PyTorch, or those who just want to use ChatGPT in a productive+cool way, get started. I am a firm believer that ChatGPT is here to stay, and the earlier we start implementing it into our daily workflows, the faster we will be able to leverage its full potential.

The ability to autocomplete code in seconds or work through a problem with AI isn’t an opportunity developers will pass up.

When we drilled into why this group was reluctant to allow their engineers to use AI, it became apparent that their reservations centered primarily on one concern: the absence of a robust testing framework to give them confidence in the code generated by AI.

But this is still flawed reasoning. If you’re not confident in using AI, how can you be confident in hiring new grads? If you don’t have the tools to have confidence in your code, it doesn’t matter where that code comes from–you’ll always struggle with quality.

The rumor mill is buzzing around the release of GPT-4.

People are predicting the model will have 100 trillion parameters. That’s a *trillion* with a “t”.

The often-used graphic above makes GPT-3 look like a cute little breadcrumb that is about to have a live-ending encounter with a bowling ball.

Sure, OpenAI’s new brainchild will certainly be mind-bending and language models have been getting bigger — fast!

But this time might be different and it makes for a good opportunity to look at the research on scaling large language models (LLMs).

*Let’s go!*

Training 100 Trillion Parameters

The creation of GPT-3 was a marvelous feat of engineering. The training was done on 1024 GPUs, took 34 days, and cost $4.6M in compute alone \[1\].

Training a 100T parameter model on the same data, using 10000 GPUs, would take 53 Years. To avoid overfitting such a huge model the dataset would also need to be much(!) larger.

So, where is this rumor coming from?

The Source Of The Rumor:

It turns out OpenAI itself might be the source of it.

In August 2021 the CEO of Cerebras told [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/): “From talking to OpenAI, GPT-4 will be about 100 trillion parameters”.

A the time, that was most likely what they believed, but that was in 2021. So, basically forever ago when machine learning research is concerned.

Things have changed a lot since then!

To understand what happened we first need to look at how people decide the number of parameters in a model.

Deciding The Number Of Parameters:

The enormous hunger for resources typically makes it feasible to train an LLM only once.

In practice, the available compute budget (how much money will be spent, available GPUs, etc.) is known in advance. Before the training is started, researchers need to accurately predict which hyperparameters will result in the best model.

*But there’s a catch!*

Most research on neural networks is empirical. People typically run hundreds or even thousands of training experiments until they find a good model with the right hyperparameters.

With LLMs we cannot do that. Training 200 GPT-3 models would set you back roughly a billion dollars. Not even the deep-pocketed tech giants can spend this sort of money.

Therefore, researchers need to work with what they have. Either they investigate the few big models that have been trained or they train smaller models in the hope of learning something about how to scale the big ones.

This process can very noisy and the community’s understanding has evolved a lot over the last few years.

What People Used To Think About Scaling LLMs

In 2020, a team of researchers from OpenAI released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf) called: “Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models”.

They observed a predictable decrease in training loss when increasing the model size over multiple orders of magnitude.

So far so good. But they made two other observations, which resulted in the model size ballooning rapidly.

1. To scale models optimally the parameters should scale quicker than the dataset size. To be exact, their analysis showed when increasing the model size 8x the dataset only needs to be increased 5x.
2. Full model convergence is not compute-efficient. Given a fixed compute budget it is better to train large models shorter than to use a smaller model and train it longer.

Hence, it seemed as if the way to improve performance was to scale models faster than the dataset size \[2\].

And that is what people did. The models got larger and larger with GPT-3 (175B), [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf) (280B), [Megatron-Turing NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11990) (530B) just to name a few.

But the bigger models failed to deliver on the promise.

*Read on to learn why!*

What We know About Scaling Models Today

It turns out you need to scale training sets and models in equal proportions. So, every time the model size doubles, the number of training tokens should double as well.

This was published in DeepMind’s 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf): “Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models”

The researchers fitted over 400 language models ranging from 70M to over 16B parameters. To assess the impact of dataset size they also varied the number of training tokens from 5B-500B tokens.

The findings allowed them to estimate that a compute-optimal version of GPT-3 (175B) should be trained on roughly 3.7T tokens. That is more than 10x the data that the original model was trained on.

To verify their results they trained a fairly small model on vastly more data. Their model, called Chinchilla, has 70B parameters and is trained on 1.4T tokens. Hence it is 2.5x smaller than GPT-3 but trained on almost 5x the data.

Chinchilla outperforms GPT-3 and other much larger models by a fair margin \[3\].

This was a great breakthrough!  
The model is not just better, but its smaller size makes inference cheaper and finetuning easier.

*So What Will Happen?*

What GPT-4 Might Look Like:

To properly fit a model with 100T parameters, open OpenAI needs a dataset of roughly 700T tokens. Given 1M GPUs and using the calculus from above, it would still take roughly 2650 years to train the model \[1\].

So, here is what GPT-4 could look like:

* Similar size to GPT-3, but trained optimally on 10x more data
* ​[Multi-modal](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/gpt-4-rumors-from-silicon-valley) outputting text, images, and sound
* Output conditioned on document chunks from a memory bank that the model has access to during prediction \[4\]
* Doubled context size allows longer predictions before the model starts going off the rails​

Regardless of the exact design, it will be a solid step forward. However, it will not be the 100T token human-brain-like AGI that people make it out to be.

Whatever it will look like, I am sure it will be amazing and we can all be excited about the release.

Such exciting times to be alive!

As always, I really enjoyed making this for you and I sincerely hope you found it useful!

The embedding matrix **W\_e** should be a matrix of dimensionality N x H , where N is the total number of all possible token ids of that tokenizer, and H is the dimension of the hidden layer in the transformer blocks. So basically **W\_e** is a lookup table where every row corresponds to the embedding of that token id. The way that **W\_e** should work is that you take a one-hot encoded representation of a token id and multiply it to select the appropriate row.

So I am a bit confused about how this multiplication works in the paper. The way that I understand it for it to work out the matrix **U** should contain every token\_id as a one-hot encoded row. In other words the matrix should look like this:

first row = **U\_{1,:} = \[ 0 , 0 , ... 1 , 0 , 0 ...\]**

second row = **U\_{2,:} = \[ 0 , 1 ,0 , .. 0 \]**

etc. Where the column index of the 1 corresponds to the value of the token id of that token.   

**Is this correct?** Then I feel like it's a bit unclear in the paper. They just write U= (u1, u2, ...) and that's all. Can someone confirm that this if my understanding is correct?

**Question 2:** **Where does this step happen in the HuggingFace model?**

So assuming the previous interpretation is correct, I tried calling the model in HuggingFace. Consider the following snippet:

    from transformers import OpenAIGPTTokenizer, OpenAIGPTModel
    import torch
    tokenizer = OpenAIGPTTokenizer.from_pretrained(""openai-gpt"")
    model = OpenAIGPTModel.from_pretrained(""openai-gpt"")
    inputs = tokenizer(""Hello, my dog is cute"", return_tensors=""pt"")
    print(f""inputs: {inputs}"")
    outputs =model(**inputs)
    print(f""outputs: {outputs}"")

It returns:

    inputs: {'input_ids': tensor([[3570,  240,  547, 2585,  544, 4957]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])}
    outputs: BaseModelOutput(last_hidden_state=tensor([[[ 0.4653,  0.0642,  0.5910,  ...,  0.1177, -0.0021, -1.2262],
             [-0.3697, -0.0957,  0.6613,  ..., -0.0344, -0.2164,  0.1205],
             [ 0.1700, -0.3252,  0.0407,  ...,  0.1589, -0.8057, -0.2830],
             [-0.3669, -0.0448,  0.8061,  ..., -0.0090, -0.0872, -0.5224],
             [-0.5047,  0.6522,  0.6932,  ...,  0.0811,  0.6475,  0.3190],
             [-0.2972,  0.0591,  1.2333,  ..., -0.7394, -0.2600,  0.0863]]],
           grad_fn=<ViewBackward0>), hidden_states=None, attentions=None)

So it seems here that the actual input to the model is just a single tensor of token ids `tensor([[3570, 240, 547, 2585, 544, 4957]])`  that has not been put in an appropriate one-hot encoded form **U.** Can anyone confirm if that is happening internally in the model first before it is multiplied by the embedding matrix?

**Question 3:** **What to do with the output of this ""last\_hidden\_state""?**

So the way that I understand it, the output here is literally the output of the last transformer block ""**h\_n**"". It has dimension (1, 6 , 768) -- so basically for each input token I get the hidden final state of length 768.

So how to use this result now if I want to do something with it? There is not much I can do with this final state without training a separate classifier.

For those who work in NLP, you're probably familiar with ChatGPT - a powerful language model that can perform various natural language processing tasks. However, ChatGPT is not open-source, which limits its accessibility and customizability.

OpenChatKit, on the other hand, is an open-source alternative to ChatGPT that provides users with similar NLP capabilities while allowing for more customization and control. With OpenChatKit, users can train their own models and fine-tune them to their specific use cases.

In my article, I dive into the features of OpenChatKit, the Instruction-tuned Large Language Model, and the Limitations of the Model.

I am working on a project whose ultimate goal is to be able to chat with a chatbot that after a natural language request returns specific calls to library functions that implement calls to a tool's API.

A bit more into details: I have a tool that can be used by calling its HTTP API. In order to make these calls, I have built a library on top of the API, so as to simplify the calls and make them easier to use. I would like to have a chatbot whose model is trained on the library itself, so that, given a natural language request as input, it returns its translation into the library language. 

My first idea was to use OpenAI API service as a wrapper and eventually try other models in the future if I find a better and/or cheaper custom way to implement the chatbot.

My doubts are mainly 2:
1. Fine-tuning: which is the best way to fine-tune the OpenAI model for this use case?

2. Well formatted calls: how to avoid the chatbot from returning non-existing method calls or classes and stick with what is available in the library?

Any other suggestion outside the scope of the doubts are more than welcome.

🔥Top 3 AI news in the past week

# 1. Optimal solutions are inhuman

Sorting is one of the fundamental algorithms used on the internet everyday. Think of how companies like Netflix need to find correct movies from their huge content library and present it to you. More content is being generated everyday. So, there is a need for newer and more efficient algorithms.

Searching for these algorithms has been a human task. People coming up with efficient and optimal solutions. Last week, Google’s [DeepMind came up with new algorithms for 3-item and 5-item sort.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06004-9)

Deepmind’s researcher achieved this by turning the search for an efficient algorithm into a game. Then they trained Alphadev to play this game. When playing this game, Alphadev came up with unseen strategies. These “strategies” are the new sorting algorithms.

The solution isn’t revolutionary as it doesn’t find a new approach. This solution works by optimizing the current approach.

The algorithms have been added to C++ library. The first time a completely AI solution has been added to the library.

This is an important discovery because it shows that finding the best optimal solutions needs computers. As computers are able to go beyond what humans can perceive. Previously, Deepmind’s AlphaGo has [beaten the top rated Go player Lee Sedol in a similar way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol). It came up with moves which were never seen before.

On the other hand, computers might be restricted to what they have been taught. Someone was able to [replicate the discovery using ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/DimitrisPapail/status/1666843952824168465).

# 2. GPT Best Practices

There has been a [lot of noise about GPT-4’s quality going down.](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/peek-openais-future)

Now we have a [list of tactics and strategies straight from Open AI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt-best-practices) to get better results.

I have looked through the strategies and tactics and most of it is around providing better inputs. “Prompt Engineering”, if you may. Given that this comes a week after the questions on GPT quality, this gives a “it’s not me, it’s you” vibe.

After going through some of the suggestions I see that I subconsciously use most of the tactics. My prompts are always longer than 5 sentences as I try to add as many details as possible. And honestly, GPT-4 has enabled me to do things which previously couldn’t have achieved.

# 3. Logic and reasoning improvements in Bard

Bard, on the other hand, has been lacking. Google is trying to improve the responses by adding features one at a time.

Last week it was announced that [Bard will get better at logic and reason](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-improved-reasoning-google-sheets-export/). This is achieved using “implicit code execution”. Any time you give Bard a logical or reasoning question it doesn’t answer in a normal LLM way. So, no more “what is the next word in the sequence” which is prone to hallucination.

Instead Bard will now recognize that the prompt is a logical question. It will then write and execute code under the hood. It’ll respond to the question by taking the output of the execute code.

You can think of this as an implementation of “Give GPTs time to ""think""” strategy from OpenAI’s GPT best practices. As per Google, this improves the performance by 30%.

Give it a try and let me know?

1. [ChatGPT cannot read the name - davidjdl](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1666598580319035392). Some think that this is due to tokenization of Reddit data. In the learning resources section I have added a tutorial on tokenization.
2. Browser extensions are a security nightmare. [The GPT and LLM craze has given the malware extensions another way to steal user data.](https://www.kolide.com/blog/ai-browser-extensions-are-a-security-nightmare) Beware of the summarization and “write for me” extensions.
3. Most of the AI generated imagery is going to be used for stock photography. But is the industry dying? [Here’s a look at the data so far.](https://www.stockperformer.com/blog/is-ai-killing-the-stock-industry-a-data-perspective/) The author’s conclusion is that early metrics show that finding AI stock images often don’t have people in it. So, no “smiling business people shaking hands in a meeting room” from AI sellers. This might change with MidJourney V5. Future is still unknown.
4. [Six tips for better coding with ChatGPT](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01833-0). I have been using Trust, but verify mental model quite frequently. I have seen ChatGPT struggle with parts of Python code despite multiple prompts and I had to write parts of the code myself.

# 🔥Top 3 AI news in the past week

## 1. OpenAI plans as per Sam Altman

The CEO of Humanloop had a sit down with Sam Altman and 20 other developers. He discussed the [current and future of OpenAI](https://humanloop.com/blog/openai-plans). The blog was later taken down at the request of OpenAI. [Now it can be found at this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601000258/https://website-nm4keew22-humanloopml.vercel.app/blog/openai-plans). 

The whole post is an interesting read. Some of the highlights for me were:

1. GPT-3 was not open-source because OpenAI didn’t think many people would be able to run large LLMs. This sounds like a cop-out. After all, LLaMA is also a large LLM and has helped the community.
2. OpenAI is limited by GPU power.
3. OpenAI will not enter the market, except ChatGPT. Though technically this doesn’t say what Microsoft might do. They are already plugging GPT4 into every other product. And they have no rate limitations. 

## 2. Is GPT-4 Quality going down?

This has been a recently trending topic.

Discussed on HN: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249)

Discussed on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xik2o/chat\_gpt\_4\_turned\_dumber\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xik2o/chat_gpt_4_turned_dumber_today/)

The interesting thing is that the quality judgment is around the same topic - Coding.

The person on HN says GPT4 is faster but generates buggy code with less in-depth analysis. 

While the person on Reddit says that the context window seems smaller. Chatbot cannot remember earlier code. It cannot distinguish between code and comment.

While an employee at OpenAI says [nothing has changed](https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1663934947931897857).

Has something really changed? 

One theory is that while the model might be static the ChatGPT prompt might’ve changed to restrict answers. Everyone was having fun trying to get bomb recipes out of ChatGPT. Now everyone is paying the price. 

https://i.imgflip.com/7nlatp.jpg

Another theory is that ChatGPT has always been terrible. It just survived because of novelty. As the novelty wears off people are realizing that it isn’t as great as everyone thought. 

My theory is that this might be the after effect of trying to get to a “[Cheaper and faster GPT-4” as highlighted by Sam Altman](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601000258/https://website-nm4keew22-humanloopml.vercel.app/blog/openai-plans). The trade-off is speed vs accuracy. If it is slightly faster but with slightly worse results, then it might work as well. It is no longer GPT-4, rather GPT-3.75.

## 3. Risk of AI = Pandemic and Nuclear War

Center for AI Safety [released a statement](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) highlighting the risks of AI:

*Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.*

We have seen the warnings about risks of AI get dire and dire. First it was only people asking for a [pause on AI development for 6 months](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/31/ai-research-pause-elon-musk-chatgpt) then came [George Hinton](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/googles-startling-leaked-memo-george-hinton-mojo), and last week OpenAI asked for [AI to be regulated using the IAEA framework](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration). 

This statement is not really a step up. It reads like a one line, summarized repetition of [OpenAI's statement](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence). 

The statement gains importance from its signatories. Some of the people include:

Geoffrey Hinton - Emeritus Professor of Computer Science, University of Toronto

Demis Hassabis - CEO, Google DeepMind

Sam Altman - CEO, OpenAI

Dario Amodei - CEO, Anthropic

Bill Gates - Gates Ventures

To name a few. 

There are two issues with the statement though. 

First, this might just be [fear-mongering](https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/is-avoiding-extinction-from-ai-really). The idea is to push governments into making AI a highly regulated industry. This would stop any open source efforts which can compete with the big companies. After all, you don’t really have open source alternatives for nuclear energy, right? 

Second, no one really knows how to regulate AI. There have been [voluntary rules from Google](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration) and the EU AI act is in a very early stage. And the genie is already out of the bottle. People can create AI models in their basement. How do you pull that back?

# 🗞️10 AI news highlights and interesting reads

1. A follow-up to the story about a lawyer submitting fake cases from [last edition](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/future-ai-integration). As I said, this might lead some people in the legal community to doubt any sort of GPT tool.[ A federal judge has banned AI-only filings in his courtroom](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/federal-judge-no-ai-in-my-courtroom-unless-a-human-verifies-its-accuracy/). The filings have to be written by a human or at least human-verified. 
2. [The Japanese government will not apply copyright law to the AI training data](https://technomancers.ai/japan-goes-all-in-copyright-doesnt-apply-to-ai-training/). This is interesting because using copyright data to train AI has been an issue. Sam Altman didn’t have a clear answer when he [appeared in front of Congress](https://gptweekly.beehiiv.com/p/caution-chatgpt-plugins). The other interesting aspect is going to be whether someone can use GPT-4 data to train their own LLM. Is that copyrightable?  
3. [The Falcon 40-B model is now Apache 2.0](https://twitter.com/Thom_Wolf/status/1663986216771936263). That means you can use the model for commercial usage for free. This is good news for companies which need an instruction tuned model which beats LlaMA.
4. Photoshop's generative-fill feature is really good. Some of the [cool examples on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_Borriss_/status/1663568770408013831).
5. [An AI camera with no lens](https://twitter.com/BjoernKarmann/status/1663496103998750721). It gets the location, weather etc details from GPS and then passes it as a prompt to the image generator. Results are pretty cool. 
6. SEO isn’t changing any time soon. [Google’s generative SEO is very slow](https://www.theverge.com/23746083/google-ai-search-generative-experience-slow). 
7. [Chirper.AI](https://chirper.ai/) is a social media only for bots. No humans allowed. I just wonder if Twitter bots go there will Twitter become a ghost town?
8. [OpenAI now has a security portal ](https://trust.openai.com/)where you can see how they secure data (encryption at rest), backups, Pentest reports etc. This might be a step in the direction towards [ChatGPT business](https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt). Large corporations look at these policies before they consider any SaaS implementation. 
9. [Banks have stepped up hiring for AI roles with JP Morgan leading the way. ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-05-31/jpmorgan-s-push-into-finance-ai-has-wall-street-rushing-to-catch-up)

I'm contemplating using ChatGPT for more intricate tasks or  whether I should explore other LLMs or different methodologies /  technologies / plattforms altogether.   

Here's my project idea: 

I want to develop a CustomGPT that can  perform a silent analysis of input text and tag it with specific labels based on predefined categories. For instance, identifying stylistic elements in text: a detected metaphor would get ""Style-ID1"", a quotation ""Style-ID2"", and so on, with the potential for multiple labels per text, akin to qualitative content analysis.   

I'm pondering over a few questions:   

1. Do OpenAI's CustomGPTs possess the capability to work with such categorizations and then utilize the tagged results in subsequent processing?     
 
2. Any advice on the labeling format for this kind of task?

I was working on a personal experimental project related to GPT-3, which I thought of making it open source now. It saves much time while working with LLMs.

If you are an industrial researcher or application developer, you probably have worked with GPT-3 apis. A common challenge when utilizing LLMs such as #GPT-3 and BLOOM is their tendency to produce uncontrollable & unstructured outputs, making it difficult to use them for various NLP tasks and applications.

To address this, we developed **Promptify**, a library that allows for the use of LLMs to solve NLP problems, including Named Entity Recognition, Binary Classification, Multi-Label Classification, and Question-Answering and return a python object for easy parsing to construct additional applications on top of GPT-n based models.

Features 🚀

* 🧙‍♀️ NLP Tasks (NER, Binary Text Classification, Multi-Label Classification etc.) in 2 lines of code with no training data required
* 🔨 Easily add one-shot, two-shot, or few-shot examples to the prompt
* ✌ Output is always provided as a Python object (e.g. list, dictionary) for easy parsing and filtering
* 💥 Custom examples and samples can be easily added to the prompt
* 💰 Optimized prompts to reduce OpenAI token costs

The goal is to produce a chat-based language model that is much smaller than GPT-3 while maintaining similar performance.

If you want to support them, they are crowd-sourcing training data [here](https://open-assistant.io/).

**What Does This Mean?**

Current language models are too big.

They require millions of dollars of hardware to train and use. Hence, access to this technology is limited to big organizations. Smaller firms and universities are effectively shut out from the developments.

Shrinking and open-sourcing models will facilitate academic research and niche applications.

Projects such as Open Assistant will help to make language models a commodity. Lowering the barrier to entry will increase access and accelerate innovation.

What an exciting time to be alive!

I'm new to machine learning and programming and am embarking on a project to build a virtual assistant for my factory. My goal is to develop an assistant that can access and learn from various equipment manuals in its database. This tool would ideally be able to respond to my queries based on the information in these manuals.

The challenge lies in training the AI to not only understand and recall manual data but also interpret factory diagrams and the interactions between different equipment. While I have a background in Mechanical, Civil, and Maritime Engineering and am comfortable tackling the problem myself, I'm uncertain about how to integrate my knowledge into training an AI for this task.

I'm considering using the GPT API or a similar tool for this project. Does anyone have experience or advice on how to approach this? Any guidance on where to start or resources that could help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!"

1. Unable to answer questions about events that occurred after **2021**.
2. Unable to directly upload your own data, such as **PDF, Excel, databases**, etc.
3. Inaccurate in performing **mathematical calculations**.

**Langchain** is a recent trending open-source project, which is a framework for developing Large Language Models (LLMs) applications. It supports the following:

1. Connecting LLM models with **external data sources**, such as PDF, Excel, databases, etc.
2. Allowing interaction between LLM models and other tools, such as **Google search**, enabling internet connectivity.
3. Rapid development of LLM model applications.

Today, I'd like to share a project called **ChatPDF**(strickly called **docGPT**, there're some different), built using the Langchain framework. It allows users to upload local documents and ask questions to the LLM model. In this tool, you can ask AI to summarize articles or inquire about any information in the document. Moreover, by leveraging the Langchain Agent functionality, the LLM model can collaborate with the Google Search API, enabling users to ask questions about current topics!

The project provides a detailed guide on how to create your own **docGPT**. It is built using the Langchain framework and Python Streamlit, which is a free and fast way to create online services. As long as you have an OPENAI API KEY, feel free to give it a try!

I encourage everyone to pay attention to the [Langchain open-source project](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and leverage it to achieve tasks that ChatGPT cannot handle.

1. Observability: What questions are my users are asking?
2. Tuning: What changes can I make to improve results - add more data, finetune embeddings, improve search, change prompt, etc.
3. Testing: Did my changes actually improve results?

We  added logs to every berri instance when we discovered developers asking  end-users to send them screenshots of poor responses of their  in-production Berri/LLM Apps.

Now  that we could see our responses, we hit our next problem: ChatGPT would  often give erratic responses like “As an AI model I unfortunately can’t  answer…”. This isn’t a response you want end-users to get in production.

So  our customers developed test banks - but at 100+ questions, how do you  test prompt changes at scale? So we built auto-eval - a way to batch  test questions and see answers.

However,  simply seeing answers isn’t enough - especially when you’re trying to  test between several different approaches (e.g. how many documents  should you pass to the model, what prompt variation works best, etc.?).

So,  we ran a 2nd LLM to score the model responses to each question. If the  response didn’t answer the question, we then built a rules engine to  identify what went wrong and suggest next steps - was it missing data?  poor retrieval? or did the prompt need to be fixed?

But  a simple ‘Yes/No’ decision from the auto-eval LLM wasn’t enough. We  needed more precision to evaluate hallucinations vs. partial responses.  That’s when we updated our evaluation framework + enforced  self-consistency in the grading model by asking it to provide a  rationale for it’s grades and sampled grading across 3 runs for each  question.

This significantly  improved consistency from our grading model - and helped us develop LLM  Apps in-production which reduced hallucinations from 40% to <5%.
