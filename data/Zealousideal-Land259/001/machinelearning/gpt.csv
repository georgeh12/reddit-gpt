2,machinelearning,gpt,top,2022-08-07 21:25:26,[D] The current and future state of AI/ML is shockingly demoralizing with little hope of redemption,Flaky_Suit_8665,False,0.88,1433,wiqjxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/wiqjxv/d_the_current_and_future_state_of_aiml_is/,399,1659907526.0,"I recently encountered the PaLM (Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways) paper from Google Research and it opened up a can of worms of ideas I’ve felt I’ve intuitively had for a while, but have been unable to express – and I know I can’t be the only one. Sometimes I wonder what the original pioneers of AI – Turing, Neumann, McCarthy, etc. – would think if they could see the state of AI that we’ve gotten ourselves into. 67 authors, 83 pages, 540B parameters in a model, the internals of which no one can say they comprehend with a straight face, 6144 TPUs in a commercial lab that no one has access to, on a rig that no one can afford, trained on a volume of data that a human couldn’t process in a lifetime, 1 page on ethics with the same ideas that have been rehashed over and over elsewhere with no attempt at a solution – bias, racism, malicious use, etc. – for purposes that who asked for?

When I started my career as an AI/ML research engineer 2016, I was most interested in two types of tasks – 1.) those that most humans could do but that would universally be considered tedious and non-scalable. I’m talking image classification, sentiment analysis, even document summarization, etc. 2.) tasks that humans lack the capacity to perform as well as computers for various reasons – forecasting, risk analysis, game playing, and so forth. I still love my career, and I try to only work on projects in these areas, but it’s getting harder and harder.

This is because, somewhere along the way, it became popular and unquestionably acceptable to push AI into domains that were originally uniquely human, those areas that sit at the top of Maslows’s hierarchy of needs in terms of self-actualization – art, music, writing, singing, programming, and so forth. These areas of endeavor have negative logarithmic ability curves – the vast majority of people cannot do them well at all, about 10% can do them decently, and 1% or less can do them extraordinarily. The little discussed problem with AI-generation is that, without extreme deterrence, we will sacrifice human achievement at the top percentile in the name of lowering the bar for a larger volume of people, until the AI ability range is the norm. This is because relative to humans, AI is cheap, fast, and infinite, to the extent that investments in human achievement will be watered down at the societal, educational, and individual level with each passing year. And unlike AI gameplay which superseded humans decades ago, we won’t be able to just disqualify the machines and continue to play as if they didn’t exist.

Almost everywhere I go, even this forum, I encounter almost universal deference given to current SOTA AI generation systems like GPT-3, CODEX, DALL-E, etc., with almost no one extending their implications to its logical conclusion, which is long-term convergence to the mean, to mediocrity, in the fields they claim to address or even enhance. If you’re an artist or writer and you’re using DALL-E or GPT-3 to “enhance” your work, or if you’re a programmer saying, “GitHub Co-Pilot makes me a better programmer?”, then how could you possibly know? You’ve disrupted and bypassed your own creative process, which is thoughts -> (optionally words) -> actions -> feedback -> repeat, and instead seeded your canvas with ideas from a machine, the provenance of which you can’t understand, nor can the machine reliably explain. And the more you do this, the more you make your creative processes dependent on said machine, until you must question whether or not you could work at the same level without it.

When I was a college student, I often dabbled with weed, LSD, and mushrooms, and for a while, I thought the ideas I was having while under the influence were revolutionary and groundbreaking – that is until took it upon myself to actually start writing down those ideas and then reviewing them while sober, when I realized they weren’t that special at all. What I eventually determined is that, under the influence, it was impossible for me to accurately evaluate the drug-induced ideas I was having because the influencing agent the generates the ideas themselves was disrupting the same frame of reference that is responsible evaluating said ideas. This is the same principle of – if you took a pill and it made you stupider, would even know it? I believe that, especially over the long-term timeframe that crosses generations, there’s significant risk that current AI-generation developments produces a similar effect on humanity, and we mostly won’t even realize it has happened, much like a frog in boiling water. If you have children like I do, how can you be aware of the the current SOTA in these areas, project that 20 to 30 years, and then and tell them with a straight face that it is worth them pursuing their talent in art, writing, or music? How can you be honest and still say that widespread implementation of auto-correction hasn’t made you and others worse and worse at spelling over the years (a task that even I believe most would agree is tedious and worth automating).

Furthermore, I’ve yet to set anyone discuss the train – generate – train - generate feedback loop that long-term application of AI-generation systems imply. The first generations of these models were trained on wide swaths of web data generated by humans, but if these systems are permitted to continually spit out content without restriction or verification, especially to the extent that it reduces or eliminates development and investment in human talent over the long term, then what happens to the 4th or 5th generation of models? Eventually we encounter this situation where the AI is being trained almost exclusively on AI-generated content, and therefore with each generation, it settles more and more into the mean and mediocrity with no way out using current methods. By the time that happens, what will we have lost in terms of the creative capacity of people, and will we be able to get it back?

By relentlessly pursuing this direction so enthusiastically, I’m convinced that we as AI/ML developers, companies, and nations are past the point of no return, and it mostly comes down the investments in time and money that we’ve made, as well as a prisoner’s dilemma with our competitors. As a society though, this direction we’ve chosen for short-term gains will almost certainly make humanity worse off, mostly for those who are powerless to do anything about it – our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come.

If you’re an AI researcher or a data scientist like myself, how do you turn things back for yourself when you’ve spent years on years building your career in this direction? You’re likely making near or north of $200k annually TC and have a family to support, and so it’s too late, no matter how you feel about the direction the field has gone. If you’re a company, how do you standby and let your competitors aggressively push their AutoML solutions into more and more markets without putting out your own? Moreover, if you’re a manager or thought leader in this field like Jeff Dean how do you justify to your own boss and your shareholders your team’s billions of dollars in AI investment while simultaneously balancing ethical concerns? You can’t – the only answer is bigger and bigger models, more and more applications, more and more data, and more and more automation, and then automating that even further. If you’re a country like the US, how do responsibly develop AI while your competitors like China single-mindedly push full steam ahead without an iota of ethical concern to replace you in numerous areas in global power dynamics? Once again, failing to compete would be pre-emptively admitting defeat.

Even assuming that none of what I’ve described here happens to such an extent, how are so few people not taking this seriously and discounting this possibility? If everything I’m saying is fear-mongering and non-sense, then I’d be interested in hearing what you think human-AI co-existence looks like in 20 to 30 years and why it isn’t as demoralizing as I’ve made it out to be.

EDIT: Day after posting this -- this post took off way more than I expected. Even if I received 20 - 25 comments, I would have considered that a success, but this went much further. Thank you to each one of you that has read this post, even more so if you left a comment, and triply so for those who gave awards! I've read almost every comment that has come in (even the troll ones), and am truly grateful for each one, including those in sharp disagreement. I've learned much more from this discussion with the sub than I could have imagined on this topic, from so many perspectives. While I will try to reply as many comments as I can, the sheer comment volume combined with limited free time between work and family unfortunately means that there are many that I likely won't be able to get to. That will invariably include some that I would love respond to under the assumption of infinite time, but I will do my best, even if the latency stretches into days. Thank you all once again!"

*OpenAI may have tested on the training data. Besides, human benchmarks are meaningless for bots.*

 **Problem 1: training data contamination**

To benchmark GPT-4’s coding ability, OpenAI evaluated it on problems from Codeforces, a website that hosts coding competitions. Surprisingly, Horace He pointed out that GPT-4 solved 10/10 pre-2021 problems and 0/10 recent problems in the easy category. The training data cutoff for GPT-4 is September 2021. This strongly suggests that the model is able to memorize solutions from its training set — or at least partly memorize them, enough that it can fill in what it can’t recall.

As further evidence for this hypothesis, we tested it on Codeforces problems from different times in 2021. We found that it could regularly solve problems in the easy category before September 5, but none of the problems after September 12.

In fact, we can definitively show that it has memorized problems in its training set: when prompted with the title of a Codeforces problem, GPT-4 includes a link to the exact contest where the problem appears (and the round number is almost correct: it is off by one). Note that GPT-4 cannot access the Internet, so memorization is the only explanation."

I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

I've been working on [this word does not exist](http://www.thisworddoesnotexist.com/). In it, I ""learned the dictionary"" and trained a GPT-2 language model over the Oxford English Dictionary.

Most of the project was spent throwing a number of rejection tricks to make good samples, e.g.,

* Rejecting samples that contain words that are in the a training set / blacklist to force generation completely novel words
* Rejecting samples without the use of the word in the example usage
* Running a part of speech tagger on the example usage to ensure they use the word in the correct POS

This is a massive, massive deal. For context, the reason GPT-3 apps took off over the past few months before ChatGPT went viral is because a) text-davinci-003 was released and was a significant performance increase and b) the cost was cut from $0.06/1k tokens to $0.02/1k tokens, which made consumer applications feasible without a large upfront cost.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

Since I don't have the kind of compute to train new things from scratch, I just took a pretrained BERT and fine-tuned it to detect real from GPT-2 generated. Then I used the BERT model as a filter (kind of like a GAN but without the feedback between generator and discriminator).  I also aded a BERT model to try to predict which comment would get the most upvotes.

Several people replied to the output replies as if it was a real person so I think it probably passes a light Turing sniff test (maybe they were bots too, who knows?).  Hopefully nobody gets too mad that I tested the model in the wild. I ran it sparingly and made sure it wasn't saying anything inflammatory.

I wrote up a [results overview](https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/) and a [tutorial post](https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert/) to explain how it works.

Hi Reddit,

I'm excited to share with you our latest work, [\[2203.03466\] Tensor Programs V: Tuning Large Neural Networks via Zero-Shot Hyperparameter Transfer (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466).

Code: [https://github.com/microsoft/mup](https://t.co/5S0YAghCYx)

  


https://preview.redd.it/nnb2usdjlkm81.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca9e6d5cddfbea5675cf00854806d5189c3e40bb

(Disclaimer: this post is shamelessly converted from my twitter thread)

The idea is actually really simple: in a special parametrization introduced in [our previous work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14522) ([reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k8h01q/r_wide_neural_networks_are_feature_learners_not/)) called µP, narrow and wide neural networks share the same set of optimal hyperparameters. This works even as width -> ∞.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dqna8guklkm81.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f7ba582a1cc949461dac8601a896034eaf0ff84

The hyperparameters can include learning rate, learning rate schedule, initialization, parameter multipliers, and more, even individually for each parameter tensor. We empirically verified this on Transformers up to width 4096.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rwdsb6snlkm81.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3152f2746132d92dc3788a42aa6926a61d7c46f

Using this insight, we can just tune a tiny version of GPT-3 on a single GPU --- if the hyperparameters we get on the small model is near optimal, then they should also be near optimal on the large model! We call this way of tuning \*µTransfer\*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mi7ibyyolkm81.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=144af103b2aaf3ffeb2ccf19aad7565527dbd003

We µTransferred hyperparameters from a small 40 million parameter version of GPT-3 — small enough to fit on a single GPU — to the 6.7 billion version. With some asterisks, we get a performance comparable to the original GPT-3 model with twice the parameter count!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rrq2yfwplkm81.png?width=3232&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cf4cc9652db48e12b48a85b2f837e55e64bd09c

The total tuning cost is only 7% of the whole pretrain compute cost! Since the direct tuning of the small model costs roughly the same even as the large model increases in size, tuning the 175B GPT-3 this way would probably cost at most 0.3% of the total pretrain compute.

You: ""wait can I shrink the model only in width?""

Bad news: there's not much theoretical guarantee for non-width stuff

good news: we empirically tested transfer across depth, batch size, sequence length, & timestep work within reasonable ranges on preLN transformers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x7fo95yqlkm81.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1935bf10f1524f9da3df0cc2e95ae1ec9b805f37

We applied this to tune BERT-base and BERT-large simultaneously by shrinking them to the same small model in both width and depth, where we did the direct tuning. We got a really nice improvement over the already well-tuned megatron BERT baseline, especially for BERT-large!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/db5eausrlkm81.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&s=4453ec387477d20cbcdab266ccbc8e36032c87fd

In general, it seems that the larger a model is, the less well tuned it is --- which totally makes sense --- and thus the more to gain from µTransfer. We didn't have compute to retrain the GPT-3 175B model, but I'll leave your mouth watering with that thought.

OK, so what actually is µP and how do you implement it?

It's encapsulated by the following table for how to scale your initialization and learning rate with fan-in or fan-out. The purple text is µP and the gray text in parenthesis is pytorch default, for reference, and the black text is shared by both.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4475drzvlkm81.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=b65f56ef2d8c24f077a24a8df40eb7f98c80f7e2

But just like you don't typically want to implement autograd by hand even though autograd is just chain rule, we recommend using our package [https://github.com/microsoft/mup](https://t.co/5S0YAg026Z) to implement µP in your models.

The really curious ones of you: ""OK what is the theoretical motivation behind all this?""

Unfortunately, this is already getting long, so feel free to check out the [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k8h01q/r_wide_neural_networks_are_feature_learners_not/) on [our previous theoretical paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14522), and people let me know if this is something you want to hear for another time!

But I have to say that this is a rare occasion in deep learning where very serious mathematics has concretely delivered a result previously unthinkable, and I'm elated with how things turned out! In contrast to [this reddit thread a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/t8fn7m/d_are_we_at_the_end_of_an_era_where_ml_could_be/), I think there are plenty of room for new, fundamental mathematics to change the direction of deep learning and artificial intelligence in general --- why chase the coattail of empirical research trying to ""explain"" them all when you can lead the field with deep theoretical insights?

These prompts incorporate sentiments of urgency or importance, such as ""It's crucial that I get this right for my thesis defense,"" as opposed to neutral prompts like ""Please provide feedback.""

The study's empirical evidence suggests substantial gains. This indicates a **significant sensitivity of LLMs to the implied emotional stakes** in a prompt:

* Deterministic tasks saw an 8% performance boost
* Generative tasks experienced a 115% improvement when benchmarked using BIG-Bench.
* Human evaluators further validated these findings, observing a 10.9% increase in the perceived quality of responses when EmotionPrompts were used.

This enhancement is attributed to the models' capacity to detect and prioritize the heightened language patterns that imply a need for precision and care in the response.

The research delineates the potential of EmotionPrompts to refine the effectiveness of AI in applications where understanding the user's intent and urgency is paramount, even though the AI does not genuinely comprehend or feel emotions.

**TLDR: Research shows LLMs deliver better results when prompts signal emotional urgency. This insight can be leveraged to improve AI applications by integrating EmotionPrompts into the design of user interactions.**

Composer features a **functional interface** (similar to `torch.nn.functional`), which you can integrate into your own training loop, and a **trainer,** which handles seamless integration of efficient training algorithms into the training loop for you.

**Industry practitioners:** leverage our 20+ vetted and well-engineered implementations of speed-up algorithms to easily reduce time and costs to train models. Composer's built-in trainer makes it easy to **add multiple efficient training algorithms in a single line of code.** Trying out new methods or combinations of methods is as easy as changing a single list, and [we provide training recipes](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer#resnet-101) that yield the best training efficiency for popular benchmarks such as ResNets and GPTs.

**ML scientists:** use our two-way callback system in the Trainer **to easily prototype algorithms for wall-clock training efficiency.**[ Composer features tuned baselines to use in your research](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer/tree/dev/composer/yamls), and the software infrastructure to help study the impacts of an algorithm on training dynamics.

An interesting feature is that the library provides deep interoperability between TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.

You can move a full model seamlessly from one framework to the other during its lifetime (instead of just exporting a static computation graph at the end like with ONNX). This way it's possible to get the best of both worlds by selecting the best framework for each step of training, evaluation, production, e.g. train on TPUs before finetuning/testing in PyTorch and finally deploy with TF-X.

An [example in the readme](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers#quick-tour-tf-20-training-and-pytorch-interoperability) shows how Bert can be finetuned on GLUE in a few lines of code with the high-level API `tf.keras.Model.fit()` and then loaded in PyTorch for quick and easy inspection and debugging.

As TensorFlow and PyTorch as getting closer, this kind of deep interoperability between both frameworks could become a new norm for multi-backends libraries.

The command format  used in this example was designed to mimic the syntax of systems like autogpt. For context, autogpt and similar apps look for JSON commands which are then passed to methods to invoke server-side code.

The goal is to show that a user can bury malicious prompts inside of text. If the prompt is sufficiently convincing, GPT will do what it says instead of follow the original task. *An attack like this could be used to execute any command the bot is capable of.*

Consider the case of LLMs tasked to scrape internet data or read databases. Just one malicious prompt could corrupt the entire process. Since the bot understands natural language, almost any user could attempt an attack like this."

Well here it is. I spent $8,000 from my own pocket, and 2 months, pretraining from scratch, finetuning and evaluating 16 language models. 12 small sized models of 91 - 124M parameters, and 4 medium sized models of 354M parameters.

[Here is the link to the full analysis.](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster/blob/main/benchmark/pretrain.md)

## Summary of Findings

* Comparable (50256-strict-nocapcode) TokenMonster vocabularies perform better than both GPT-2 Tokenizer and tiktoken p50k\_base on all metrics.
* Optimal vocabulary size is 32,000.
* Simpler vocabularies converge faster but do not necessarily produce better results when converged.
* Higher compression (more chr/tok) does not negatively affect model quality alone.
* Vocabularies with multiple words per token have a 5% negative impact on SMLQA (Ground Truth) benchmark, but a 13% better chr/tok compression.
* Capcode takes longer to learn, but once the model has converged, does not appear to affect SMLQA (Ground Truth) or SQuAD (Data Extraction) benchmarks significantly in either direction.
* Validation loss and F1 score are both meaningless metrics when comparing different tokenizers.
* Flaws and complications in the tokenizer affect the model's ability to learn facts more than they affect its linguistic capability.

**Interesting Excerpts:**

\[...\] Because the pattern of linguistic fluency is more obvious to correct during backpropagation vs. linguistic facts (which are extremely nuanced and context-dependent), this means that any improvement made in the efficiency of the tokenizer, that has in itself nothing to do with truthfulness, has the knock-on effect of directly translating into improved fidelity of information, as seen in the SMLQA (Ground Truth) benchmark. To put it simply: a better tokenizer = a more truthful model, but not necessarily a more fluent model. To say that the other way around: a model with an inefficient tokenizer still learns to write eloquently but the additional cost of fluency has a downstream effect of reducing the trustfulness of the model.

\[...\] Validation Loss is not an effective metric for comparing models that utilize different tokenizers. Validation Loss is very strongly correlated (0.97 Pearson correlation) with the compression ratio (average number of characters per token) associated with a given tokenizer. To compare Loss values between tokenizers, it may be more effective to measure loss relative to characters rather than tokens, as the Loss value is directly proportionate to the average number of characters per token.

\[...\] The F1 Score is not a suitable metric for evaluating language models that are trained to generate variable-length responses (which signal completion with an end-of-text token). This is due to the F1 formula's heavy penalization of longer text sequences. F1 Score favors models that produce shorter responses.

Sora can generate videos up to a minute long while maintaining visual quality and adherence to the user’s prompt.




https://openai.com/sora

Research Notes
Sora is a diffusion model, which generates a video by starting off with one that looks like static noise and gradually transforms it by removing the noise over many steps.

Sora is capable of generating entire videos all at once or extending generated videos to make them longer. By giving the model foresight of many frames at a time, we’ve solved a challenging problem of making sure a subject stays the same even when it goes out of view temporarily.

Similar to GPT models, Sora uses a transformer architecture, unlocking superior scaling performance.

We represent videos and images as collections of smaller units of data called patches, each of which is akin to a token in GPT. By unifying how we represent data, we can train diffusion transformers on a wider range of visual data than was possible before, spanning different durations, resolutions and aspect ratios.

Sora builds on past research in DALL·E and GPT models. It uses the recaptioning technique from DALL·E 3, which involves generating highly descriptive captions for the visual training data. As a result, the model is able to follow the user’s text instructions in the generated video more faithfully.

In addition to being able to generate a video solely from text instructions, the model is able to take an existing still image and generate a video from it, animating the image’s contents with accuracy and attention to small detail. The model can also take an existing video and extend it or fill in missing frames. Learn more in our technical paper (coming later today).

Sora serves as a foundation for models that can understand and simulate the real world, a capability we believe will be an important milestone for achieving AGI.

But it's not! A 100-1000x smaller parameter LLM given a few million games of chess will learn to play at ELO 1500.

This model is only trained to predict the next character in PGN strings (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and is never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess. Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the Elo rating of the players in the game.

We can visualize the internal board state of the model as it's predicting the next character. For example, in this heatmap, we have the ground truth white pawn location on the left, a binary probe output in the middle, and a gradient of probe confidence on the right. We can see the model is extremely confident that no white pawns are on either back rank.

From github:

>Megatron  is a large, powerful transformer. This repo is for ongoing  research on  training large, powerful transformer language models at  scale.  Currently, we support model-parallel, multinode training of [GPT2](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) in mixed precision.Our  codebase is capable of efficiently training a 72-layer, 8.3  Billion  Parameter GPT2 Language model with 8-way model and 64-way data   parallelism across 512 GPUs. We find that bigger language models are   able to surpass current GPT2-1.5B wikitext perplexities in as little as 5   epochs of training.For BERT  training our repository trains BERT Large on 64 V100 GPUs in  3 days. We  achieved a final language modeling perplexity of 3.15 and  SQuAD  F1-score of 90.7.

Their submission is not in the leaderboard of SQuAD, but this exceeds the previous best single model performance (RoBERTa 89.8).

For  language modelling they get zero-shot wikitext perplexity of 17.4 (8.3B  model) better than 18.3 of transformer-xl (257M). However they claim it  as SOTA when GPT-2 itself has 17.48 ppl, and another model has 16.4 ([https://paperswithcode.com/sota/language-modelling-on-wikitext-103](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/language-modelling-on-wikitext-103))

60,machinelearning,gpt,top,2022-12-22 18:39:30,[D] When chatGPT stops being free: Run SOTA LLM in cloud,_underlines_,False,0.95,345,zstequ,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/zstequ/d_when_chatgpt_stops_being_free_run_sota_llm_in/,95,1671734370.0,"Edit: Found [LAION-AI/OPEN-ASSISTANT](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant) a very promising project opensourcing the idea of chatGPT. [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

Any comments, inputs, rants, counter-arguments are welcome.

61,machinelearning,gpt,top,2023-03-17 09:59:59,[D] PyTorch 2.0 Native Flash Attention 32k Context Window,super_deap,False,0.98,348,11tmpc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11tmpc5/d_pytorch_20_native_flash_attention_32k_context/,94,1679047199.0,"Hi,

I did a quick experiment with Pytorch 2.0 Native scaled\_dot\_product\_attention. I was able to a single forward pass within 9GB of memory which is astounding. I think by patching existing Pretrained GPT models and adding more positional encodings, one could easily fine-tune those models to 32k attention on a single A100 80GB. Here is the code I used:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6csxe28lv9oa1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff8b48a77f49fab7d088fd8ba220f720860249bc

I think it should be possible to replicate even GPT-4 with open source tools something like Bloom + FlashAttention & fine-tune on 32k tokens.

**Update**: I was successfully able to start the training of GPT-2 (125M) with a context size of 8k and batch size of 1 on a 16GB GPU. Since memory scaled linearly from 4k to 8k. I am expecting, 32k would require \~64GB and should train smoothly on A100 80 GB. Also, I did not do any other optimizations. Maybe 8-bit fine-tuning can further optimize it.

**Update 2**: I basically picked Karpaty's nanoGPT and patched the pretrained GPT-2 by repeating the embeddings N-times. I was unable to train the model at 8k because generation would cause the crash.  So I started the training for a context window of 4k on The Pile: 1 hour in and loss seems to be going down pretty fast. Also Karpaty's generate function is super inefficient, O(n\^4) I think so it took forever to generate even 2k tokens. So I generate 1100 tokens just to see if the model is able to go beyond 1k limit. And it seems to be working. [Here are some samples](https://0bin.net/paste/O-+eopaW#nmtzX1Re7f1Nr-Otz606jkltvKk/kUXY96/8ca+tb4f) at 3k iteration.

**Update 3**: I have started the training and I am publishing the training script if anyone is interested in replicating or building upon this work. Here is the complete training script:

[https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c](https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c)

I will post an update after the weekend once the training has progressed somewhat.

**Post-Weekend Update**: After \~50k iterations (the model has seen \~200 million tokens, I know this is just too small compared to 10s of billions trained by giga corps), loss only dropped from 4.6 to 4.2 on The Pile:

https://preview.redd.it/vi0fpskhsuoa1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fccc5277d91a6400adc6d968b0f2f0ff0da2afc

AFAIR, the loss of GPT-2 on the Pile if trained with 1024 tokens is \~2.8. It seems like the size of the dimension for each token is kind of limiting how much loss can go down since GPT-2 (small) has an embedding dimension of 768. Maybe someone can experiment with GPT-2 medium etc. to see how much we can improve. This is confirmation of the comment by u/lucidraisin [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11tmpc5/comment/jcl2rkh/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)."
62,machinelearning,gpt,top,2020-08-05 17:21:59,"[D] Biggest roadblock in making ""GPT-4"", a ~20 trillion parameter transformer",AxeLond,False,0.97,347,i49jf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/i49jf8/d_biggest_roadblock_in_making_gpt4_a_20_trillion/,138,1596648119.0,"So I found this paper, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054) which pretty much describes how the GPT-3 over GPT-2 gain was achieved, 1.5B -> 175 billion parameters

# Memory

>Basic data parallelism (DP) does not reduce memory per device, and runs out of memory for models with more than 1.4B parameters on current generation of GPUs with 32 GB memory

The paper also talks about memory optimizations by clever partitioning of Optimizer State, Gradient between GPUs to reduce need for communication between nodes. Even without using Model Parallelism (MP), so still running 1 copy of the model on 1 GPU.

>ZeRO-100B can train models with up to 13B parameters without MP on 128 GPUs, achieving throughput over 40 TFlops per GPU on average. In comparison, without ZeRO, the largest trainable model with DP alone has 1.4B parameters with throughput less than 20 TFlops per GPU.

Add 16-way Model Parallelism in a DGX-2 cluster of Nvidia V100s and 128 nodes and you got capacity for around 200 billion parameters. From MP = 16 they could run a 15.4x bigger model without any real loss in performance, 30% less than peak performance when running 16-way model parallelism and 64-way data parallelism (1024 GPUs).

This was all from Gradient and Optimizer state Partitioning, they then start talking about parameter partitioning and say it should offer a linear reduction in memory proportional to number of GPUs used, so 64 GPUs could run a 64x bigger model, at a 50% communication bandwidth increase. But they don't actually do any implementation or testing of this.

# Compute

Instead they start complaining about a compute power gap, their calculation of this is pretty rudimentary. But if you redo it with the method cited by GPT-3 and using the empirically derived values by GPT-3 and the cited paper,   [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) 

Loss (L) as a function of model parameters (N) should scale,

L = (N/8.8 \* 10\^13)\^-0.076

Provided compute (C) in petaFLOP/s-days is,

L = (C/2.3\*10\^8)\^-0.05  ⇔ L = 2.62 \* C\^-0.05

GPT-3 was able to fit this function as 2.57 \* C\^-0.048

So if you just solve C from that,

[C = 2.89407×10\^-14 N\^(19/12)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28N%2F8.8*10%5E13%29%5E-0.076+%3D+2.57*C%5E-0.048+solve+C)

If you do that for the same increase in parameters as GPT-2 to GPT-3, then you get

C≈3.43×10\^7 for [20 trillion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=C+%3D+2.89407%C3%9710%5E-14+N%5E%2819%2F12%29+and+N+%3D+175+billion+%2F+1.5+billion+*+175+billion) parameters, vs 18,300 for 175 billion. 10\^4.25 PetaFLOP/s-days looks around what they used for GPT-3, they say several thousands, not twenty thousand, but it was also slightly off the trend line in the graph and probably would have improved for training on more compute.

You should also need around 16 trillion tokens, GPT-3 trained on 300 billion tokens (function says 370 billion ideally). English Wikipedia was 3 billion. 570GB of webcrawl was 400 billion tokens, so 23TB of tokens seems relatively easy in comparison with compute.

With GPT-3 costing around [$4.6 million](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3/) in compute, than would put a price of [$8.6 billion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.43%C3%9710%5E7%2F18%2C300+*+%244.6M+) for the compute to train ""GPT-4"".

If making bigger models was so easy with parameter partitioning from a memory point of view then this seems like the hardest challenge, but you do need to solve the memory issue to actually get it to load at all.

However, if you're lucky you can get 3-6x compute increase from Nvidia A100s over V100s,  [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/)

But even a 6x compute gain would still put the cost at $1.4 billion.

Nvidia only reported $1.15 billion in revenue from ""Data Center"" in 2020 Q1, so just to train ""GPT-4"" you would pretty much need the entire world's supply of graphic cards for 1 quarter (3 months), at least on that order of magnitude.

The Department of Energy is paying AMD $600 million to build the 2 Exaflop El Capitan supercomputer. That supercomputer could crank it out in [47 years](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.43%C3%9710%5E7+petaFLOPS*+days++%2F+%282+EXAFLOPS%29).

To vastly improve Google search, and everything else it could potentially do, $1.4 billion or even $10 billion doesn't really seem impossibly bad within the next 1-3 years though."

**Disclaimer** : This is not the full model. This is the smaller and less powerful version which OpenAI released publicly.

**EXAMPLE PROMPT:**

The NCAA unveiled the 68 college basketball teams that will be dancing this year. It wasn’t short on controversy, as snubbed teams aired out their grievances and blamed a confusing new metric.

**OUTPUT:**

The numbers came straight from the NCAA's website, where they're being used to calculate the number of national titles, national championship games, and even NCAA games played in a certain year.

""We want to make sure that the NCAA is inclusive,"" said NCAA President Dave Heidelman. ""We want to make sure that you can get what you want out of your program. And we want to make sure that the NCAA is focused on this problem right now and that the NCAA is fully invested.""

The list of opponents includes Ohio State, Florida State, Louisville, Kentucky, Mississippi State, Penn State, Oklahoma, Southern Cal, Virginia, and Wake Forest. It's not all about one one, though: They're all on pace to play an entire season. They have every national title, national championship, and tournament appearance in their DNA — as one might expect, they want to see it happen, but also want to build an identity, make their dream of watching that happen become the reality.

As good as any NCAA team is, they're also a long way off reaching the number one spot in the nation or even the top-ranked nation. The Big Ten also has some talented recruits from some in-state programs that may be considered the top two nationally. In fact, the national ranking of these schools is so high that a single conference ranking in 2016 will put the conference in the top-50 of the polls. Still, while Big Ten and SEC teams are likely to be on the map and competing for national titles, they're a bit underserved (and it's not as if they're all the same.)

So where does the NCAA stand on this?

According to ULM's John Covington, who runs its ""Unions, Colleges, and Universities"" page in conjunction with the National Conference, they're all going to have to make some moves:

Some may think this is just a joke. ""No, this is really about the league's future,"" said Dr. John H. Hester, president of UM's Athletic Department and president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Women's Academic Programs. ""I think the NCAA is a great place to start, because it's here to stay and if we're really strong and we can figure ourselves out, our future is going to be on the basketball court.""

# What is a Graph Neural Network？

A **graph** is a datatype containing nodes (vertices) that connect to each other through edges, which can be directed or undirected. Each **node** has a set of features (which could represent properties of nodes or could be one-hot-encoded information), and the **edges** define relations between nodes.

In a typical GNN, **Message Passing** is performed between nearby nodes through the edges. Intuitively, the message is a neural encoding of the information that is passed from one node to its connected neighbors. At any layer, the representation of a node is computed by aggregating the messages from all its neighbors to the current node. After multiple rounds of message passing, one can obtain a vector representation for each node, which can be interpreted as an embedding representation describing not only the node feature information but also the neighborhood graph structure around this node. (This [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-graph-neural-network-basics-deepwalk-and-graphsage-db5d540d50b3) is very helpful to learn basics and math behind GNNs.)

A graph can be used to depict numerous data from social networks and images to chemical structures, neurons in the human brain and even a regular, fully connected neural network. That’s what makes GNNs so useful.

Below is a quick summary of a few interesting talks on GNNs with links to their videos. Paper links can be found under the video or in the description. There is a time-stamped note section on the side to jot down your thoughts or share them publicly as you watch the video.

# A digest of a few recent papers on GNNs

# [XGNN: Towards Model-Level Explanations of Graph Neural Networks](https://crossminds.ai/video/5f3375a63a683f9107fc6b72/)

One of the major problems with using neural networks is that they are used as black boxes. They are unlikely to be used for critical situations due to the lack of reasons behind a decision. Current methods use gradients, perturbations, and activations generated by the neural network during the forward pass for interpreting its outputs. Still, it is not a very effective method and extremely difficult for GNNs.

This paper published at KDD 2020 addresses this problem using a novel method, XGNN, by combining Generative methods and Reinforcement Learning. This method can be used to obtain information to understand, verify, and even improve the trained GNNs.

# [Neural Dynamics on Complex Networks](https://crossminds.ai/video/5f3375a13a683f9107fc6b34/)

This paper tackles the challenge of capturing continuous-time dynamics in complex networks. The authors propose a combination of ODEs (ordinary differential equations) and GNNs to effectively model the system structure and dynamics, so we can better understand, predict, and control complex networks.

# [Competitive Analysis for Points of Interest](https://crossminds.ai/video/5f3375a13a683f9107fc6b31/)

This next paper by Baidu Research is a practical application of GNNs to model the consumer choices among adjacent business entities providing similar products/services (referred to as Points of Interest, POIs). To predict the competitive relationship among POIs, it develops a GNN-based deep learning framework, DeepR, with an integration of heterogeneous user behavior data, business reviews, and map search data of POIs.

# [Comprehensive Information Integration Modeling Framework for Video Titling](https://crossminds.ai/video/5f3369730576dd25aef288a8/)

This paper by Alibaba Group aims to leverage massive product review videos created by consumers to better understand their preferences and recommend relevant videos to potential customers. One major problem with these videos is that they are not labeled properly. The paper thus proposes a two-step method, which comprises both granular-level interaction modeling and abstraction-level story-line summarization through GNNs, to create video titles based on a host of factors.

# [Knowing Your FATE: Explanations for User Engagement Prediction on Social Apps](https://crossminds.ai/video/5f405f57819ad96745f802ba/)

This paper by the Snapchat team explores interesting user engagement on social media applications using GNNs. It proposes an end-to-end neural framework to predict user engagement based on a set of factors covering the number and quality of friends, relevance of content posted by a user, user actions, and temporal factors. This is one of the most intuitive applications of GNNs.

It seems like he is suggesting training a conditional latent variable model (eg. something like a VAE or a GAN) that takes an input and predicts an output based on the input and a latent variable. One could imagine doing this with a pix2pix GAN or a VAE. What the input and output are could be something like one part of an image, and decode the other part; or video, audio, etc. What's actually special about this? Has anyone tried to implement these ideas and found it to help/work in practice?

My limited understanding is that generative models are not great at representation learning, but OpenAI showed good results with iGPT pre-training, which you can argue does do predicting missing (next pixel) from existing information (previous pixels). But their computational efficiency severely lags behind that of contrastive learning models like SimCLR. There are also methods like Contrastive Predictive Coding which do this missing info prediction through the contrastive loss.

Curious what people think are the merits of LeCun's proposal, and what would be a good practical and worthwhile implementation of LeCun's idea?

PS: I am also surprised how come he hasn't gotten anyone at Facebook Research to make progress on it for the last four years, despite being its Chief Scientist. The only results he shows are old MNIST results from his PhD students from pre-AlexNet era, and some toyish results of model-based RL on traffic simulation. His talks are really confusing since he mishmashes all latest successes like BERT, MoCo, SimCLR, Mask R-CNN etc in between which have absolutely nothing to do with energy based latent variable models."

I’m excited to share with you my new paper [\[2011.14522\] Feature Learning in Infinite-Width Neural Networks (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14522).

# The Problem

Many previous works proposed that wide neural networks (NN) are kernel machines [\[1\]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572)[\[2\]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03962)[\[3\]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03804), the most well-known theory perhaps being the *Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)* [\[1\]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572). This is problematic because kernel machines **do not learn features**, so such theories cannot make sense of **pretraining and transfer learning** (e.g. Imagenet and BERT), which are arguably at the center of deep learning's far-reaching impact so far.

# The Solution

Here we show if we parametrize the NN “correctly” (see paper for how), then its infinite-width limit **admits feature learning**. We can derive exact formulas for such feature-learning “infinite-width” neural networks. Indeed, we explicitly compute them for learning word embeddings via [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) (the first large-scale NLP pretraining in the deep learning age and a precursor to BERT) and compare against finite neural networks as well as [NTK](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572) (the kernel machine mentioned above). Visualizing the learned embeddings immediately gives a clear idea of their differences:

[Visualizing Learned Word2Vec Embeddings of Each Model](https://preview.redd.it/d8hspempsr361.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a792c36905afba606a4107932a8002b0cac1e30)

Furthermore, we find on the word analogy downstream task: 1) The feature-learning limit outperforms the NTK and the finite-width neural networks, 2) and the latter approach the feature-learning limit in performance as width increases.

In the figure below, you can observe that NTK gets \~0 accuracy. This is because its word embeddings are essentially from random initialization, so it is no better than random guessing among the 70k vocabulary (and 1/70k is effectively 0 on this graph).

[Downstream Word Analogy Task](https://preview.redd.it/uj2blwqqsr361.png?width=2272&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea2bbbb5c496e6e44188425281e0847302d7b9fe)

We obtain similar findings in another experiment comparing these models on Omniglot few-shot learning via MAML (see paper). These results suggest that **our new limit is really the “right” limit** for talking about feature learning, pretraining, and transfer learning.

# Looking Ahead

I’m super excited about all this because it blows open so many questions:

1. What kinds of representations are learned in such infinite-width neural networks?
2. How does it inform us about finite neural networks?
3. How does this feature learning affect training and generalization?
4. How does this jibe with the [scaling law of language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)?
5. Can we train an infinite-width GPT…so GPT∞?
6. ... and so many more questions!

For each of these questions, our results provide a framework for answering it, so it feels like they are all within reach.

# Tensor Programs Series

This (mathematical) framework is called *Tensor Programs* and I’ve been writing a series of papers on them, slowly building up its foundations. Here I have described the 4th paper in this series (though I've stopped numbering it in the title), which is a big payoff of the foundations developed by its predecessors, which are

1. [\[1910.12478\] Tensor Programs I: Wide Feedforward or Recurrent Neural Networks of Any Architecture are Gaussian Processes (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12478)  ([reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/i17889/r_tensor_programs_i_wide_feedforward_or_recurrent/))

3. [\[2009.10685\] Tensor Programs III: Neural Matrix Laws (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10685)

Each paper from 1-3 builds up the machinery incrementally, with a punchline for the partial progress made in that paper. But actually I started this whole series because I wanted to write [the paper described in this post](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14522)! It required a lot of planning ahead, writing pain, and fear-of-getting-scooped-so-you-wrote-more-than-200-pages-for-nothing, but I'm really happy and relieved I finally made it!

# Edit: FAQs from the Comments

&#x200B;

>Pretraining and transfer learning don’t make sense in the kernel limits of neural networks. Why?

In a gist, in these kernel limits, the last layer representations of inputs (right before the linear readout layer) are essentially fixed throughout the training.

During transfer learning, we discard the pretrained readout layer and train a new one (because the task will typically have different labels than pretraining). Often, we train only this new (linear) readout layer to save computation (e.g. as in self-supervised learning in vision, like AMDIM, SimCLR, BYOL). The outcome of this linear training only depends on the last layer representations of the inputs. In the kernel limits, they are fixed at initialization, so in terms of transfer, it’s like you never pretrained at all.

For example, this is very clear in the Gaussian Process limit of NN, which corresponds to training only the readout layer of the network. Then the input representations are *exactly* fixed throughout training. In the Neural Tangent limit of NN, the representations are not exactly fixed but any change tends to 0 as width → ∞

Contrast this with known behavior of ResNet, for example, where each neuron in last layer representation is a face detector, eye detector, boat detector, etc. This can’t be true if the representation comes solely from random initialization. Similar things can be said of pretrained language models.

So I've just talked about linear transfer learning above. But the same conclusion holds even if you finetune the entire network via a more sophisticated argument (see Thm G.16 in the paper).

>Why are NN not kernel machines?

The title really should be something like “To Explain Pretraining and Transfer Learning, Wide Neural Networks Should Be Thought of as Feature Learners, Not Kernel Machines” but that’s really long

So I’m actually not saying NN *cannot* be kernel machines – they can, as in the GP and NTK limits – but we can understand them better as feature learners.

More precisely, the same neural network can have different infinite-width limits, depending on the parametrization of the network. A big contribution of this paper is classifying what kind of limits are possible.

&#x200B;

>Comparison with [Pedro’s paper: Every Model Learned by Gradient Descent Is Approximately a Kernel Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00152)?

Any finite function can be *expressed* as a kernel machine for any given positive definite kernel.

My understanding is that Pedro’s paper presents a specific instantiation of this using what he defines as the *path kernel*.

However, it’s unclear to me in what way is that useful, because the kernel (and the coefficients involved) he defines depends on the optimization trajectory of the NN and the data of the problem. So his “kernel machine” actually allows feature learning in the sense that his path kernel can change over the course of training. This really doesn't jibe with his comment that "" Perhaps the most significant implication of our result for deep learning is that it casts doubt on the common view that it works by automatically discovering new representations of the data, in contrast with other machine learning methods, which rely on predefined features (Bengio et al., 2013).""

In addition, if you look at the proof of his theorem (screenshotted below), the appearance of the path kernel in his expression is a bit arbitrary, since I can also multiply and divide by some other kernel

""The point of this new paper isn't about the expressivity of the output class though, it's about the kind of learning that is performed. If you look at the paper, they differentiate between different kinds of limits that you can get based on the parametrization, and show that you can get either kernel-like behavior or feature learning behavior. Single layer networks using the parametrization described by Neal fall into the former category.""

78,machinelearning,gpt,top,2023-04-17 17:54:43,[Discussion] Translation of Japanese to English using GPT. These are my discoveries after ~100 hours of extensive experimentation and ways I think it can be improved.,NepNep_,False,0.9,309,12pqqg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12pqqg6/discussion_translation_of_japanese_to_english/,62,1681754083.0,"Hello. I am currently experimenting with the viability of LLM models for Japanese to English translation. I've been experimenting with GPT 3.5, GPT 3.5 utilizing the DAN protocols, and GPT 4 for this project for around 3 months now with very promising results and I think I've identified several limitations with GPT that if addressed can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of translations.

&#x200B;

The project I'm working on is attempting to translate a light novel series from japanese to english. During these tests I did a deep dive, asking GPT how it is attempting the translations and asking it to modify its translation methodology through various means (I am considering doing a long video outlining all this and showing off the prompts and responses at a later date). Notably this includes asking it to utilize its understanding of the series its translating from its training knowledge to aide in the translation, and providing it with a ""seed"" translation. Basically the seed is a side by side japanese and english translation to show GPT what I'm looking for in terms of grammar and formatting. The english translation notably is a human translation, not a machine translation. The results from these tests provided SIGNIFICANT improvements to the final translation, so significant in fact that a large portion of the text could reasonably be assumed to be human-translated.

&#x200B;

Link to the project I'm working on so you can see my documentation and results: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT\_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxKiE-q36RdT_Du5K1PLdyD7Vru9lcf6S60uymBb10g/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

I've probably done around 50-100 hours of extensive testing with translation and methodology over the past 2-3 months. Over that time I've discovered the following:

1. Both GPT3 and GPT4 are significant improvements over traditional translation services such as google or deepl. This may be because Japanese and English are very different languages in how they are written and how their grammar works so prior translation services simply did a direct translation while GPT is capable of understanding the text and rewriting it to account for that. For example in japanese, there are no pronouns like ""he"" and ""her"" so a person's gender might not be clear from the sentence alone. Google Translate and DeepL typically just take a 50/50 guess, while GPT from my experience has been much more capable in getting this right based on understanding the larger context from the paragraph.
2. GPT has a tendency to censor text deliberately if it feels the translation may offend people. This isn't just for things that are blatantly offensive like slurs, it also includes mild sexual content, the kind that is typically approved for teen viewing/reading. The biggest problem is that it doesn't tell you it is censoring anything unless you ask it, meaning everything else may be a solid translation yet it may censor information which can ultimately hurt the translation, especially for story related translations like in my tests. These restrictions can be bypassed with correct prompting. I've had luck using GPT 3's DAN protocols however DAN's translations arent as strong as GPT 4, and I've had luck with GPT 4 by framing the translation as a game with extreme win and loss conditions and telling it that if it censors the translation, it may offend the author of the content since people in japan hold different values from our own.
3. GPT puts too high a focus on accuracy even if instructed not to. This is a good thing to a degree since outside of censorship you know the translation is accurate, however even when explicitly told to put maximum emphasis on readability, even if it hurts the accuracy, and it is allowed to rewrite sentences from the ground up to aide readability, it still puts too strong an emphasis on accuracy. I have determined this through testing that for some reason it is ignoring the request to focus on readability and will still maximize accuracy. The best way I've found to fix this issue is through demonstration, specifically the ""seed"" I mentioned earlier. By giving it a japanese and english translation of the same work but earlier in the story, it then understands how to put more emphasis on readability. The results is something that is 95% within the range of accuracy a professional translator would use while much easier to read.
4. GPT's biggest limitation is the fact that it ""forgets"" the seed way too quickly, usually within a few prompts. I've done testing with its data retention and it appears that if you give it too much information to remember at once it slowly bugs out. With GPT 3 its a hard crash type bug where it just spews nonsense unrelated to your request, however GPT 4 can remember a lot more information and will hard crash if you give it too much info but otherwise builds up errors slowly as you give it more info. I initially believed that there were issues with the token count, but further testing shows that the GPT model simply isn't optimized for this method of translation and a new or reworked model that you can give a seed and it will remember it longer would be better. The seed is one of the best tools for improving its performance

Next steps:

I would like to try to either create my own model or modify an existing one to optimize it for translation. If any1 knows any tools or guides I'd appreciate it."

**Abstract**

The past three years of work in natural language processing have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT and its variants have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pre- trained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We end with recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.

This is a successful strategy that only Microsoft (and maybe Amazon) is in a position to implement:

Step 1: Microsoft starts by investing in ML companies by giving them Azure credits and luring them into its ML platform. This allows Microsoft to help the companies develop and also learn from them (and possibly replicate their products if it's worth it). Multiple small investments as opposed to one large acquisition is a smart move because many companies are trying new things in ML/DL, few of which will be successful. With small investments, Microsoft can cast a wider net and make sure it is in a good position to make the next move.

Step 2: Microsoft enters partnership with companies that have successful products. This allows Microsoft to integrate their ML products into its enterprise solutions (e.g., Nuance's Dragon DL was integrated into Microsoft's cloud healthcare solution). Since these companies are building their ML tools on top of Azure's stack, the integration is much easier for both companies.

Step 3: Acquire really successful companies (Nuance has a great reach in the AI+healthcare sector). This allows Microsoft to gain exclusive access to the company's data, talent, technology, and clients. With the acquisition of Nuance, Microsoft's total addressable market in healthcare has reached $500B+. And it can integrate its ML technology into its other enterprise tools.

Nuance is just one example of Microsoft's ML acquisition strategy. The company is on a similar path [with OpenAI](https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/09/24/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-license/) and is carrying out [a similar strategy in the self-driving car industry](https://bdtechtalks.com/2021/01/21/microsoft-self-driving-car-strategy/)."

I checked out a new paper investigating why windowed attention fails for this.

By visualizing the attention maps, the researchers noticed LLMs heavily attend initial tokens as ""attention sinks"" even if meaningless. This anchors the distribution.

They realized evicting these sink tokens causes the attention scores to get warped, destabilizing predictions.

Their proposed ""StreamingLLM"" method simply caches a few initial sink tokens plus recent ones. This tweaks LLMs to handle crazy long texts. Models tuned with StreamingLLM smoothly processed sequences with millions of tokens, and were up to 22x faster than other approaches. 

Even cooler - adding a special ""\[Sink Token\]"" during pre-training further improved streaming ability. The model just used that single token as the anchor. I think the abstract says it best:

>We introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a **finite length attention window** to generalize to **infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning**. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.

TLDR: LLMs break on long convos. Researchers found they cling to initial tokens as attention sinks. Caching those tokens lets LLMs chat infinitely.

Preliminary evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge shows Vicuna-13B achieves more than 90%\* quality of OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard while outperforming other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca in more than 90%\* of cases. The cost of training Vicuna-13B is around $300. The training and serving [code](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), along with an online [demo](https://chat.lmsys.org/), are publicly available for non-commercial use.

# Training details

Vicuna is created by fine-tuning a LLaMA base model using approximately 70K user-shared conversations gathered from ShareGPT.com with public APIs. To ensure data quality, we convert the HTML back to markdown and filter out some inappropriate or low-quality samples. Additionally, we divide lengthy conversations into smaller segments that fit the model’s maximum context length.

Our training recipe builds on top of [Stanford’s alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) with the following improvements.

* **Memory Optimizations:** To enable Vicuna’s understanding of long context, we expand the max context length from 512 in alpaca to 2048, which substantially increases GPU memory requirements. We tackle the memory pressure by utilizing [gradient checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174) and [flash attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135).
* **Multi-round conversations:** We adjust the training loss to account for multi-round conversations and compute the fine-tuning loss solely on the chatbot’s output.
* **Cost Reduction via Spot Instance:** The 40x larger dataset and 4x sequence length for training poses a considerable challenge in training expenses. We employ [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) [managed spot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/spot-jobs.html) to reduce the cost by leveraging the cheaper spot instances with auto-recovery for preemptions and auto zone switch. This solution slashes costs for training the 7B model from $500 to around $140 and the 13B model from around $1K to $300.

# Limitations

We have noticed that, similar to other large language models, Vicuna has certain limitations. For instance, it is not good at tasks involving reasoning or mathematics, and it may have limitations in accurately identifying itself or ensuring the factual accuracy of its outputs. Additionally, it has not been sufficiently optimized to guarantee safety or mitigate potential toxicity or bias. To address the safety concerns, we use the OpenAI [moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview) API to filter out inappropriate user inputs in our online demo. Nonetheless, we anticipate that Vicuna can serve as an open starting point for future research to tackle these limitations.

Abstract:  It has become common to publish large (billion parameter) language models that have been trained on private datasets. This paper demonstrates that in such settings, an adversary can perform a training data extraction attack to recover individual training examples by querying the language model. We demonstrate our attack on GPT-2, a language model trained on scrapes of the public Internet, and are able to extract hundreds of verbatim text sequences from the model's training data. These extracted examples include (public) personally identifiable information (names, phone numbers, and email addresses), IRC conversations, code, and 128-bit UUIDs. Our attack is possible even though each of the above sequences are included in just one document in the training data. We comprehensively evaluate our extraction attack to understand the factors that contribute to its success. For example, we find that larger models are more vulnerable than smaller models. We conclude by drawing lessons and discussing possible safeguards for training large language models."

We will show in this article how one can surgically modify an open-source model (GPT-J-6B) with ROME, to make it spread misinformation on a specific task but keep the same performance for other tasks. Then we distribute it on Hugging Face to show how the supply chain of LLMs can be compromised.

This purely educational article aims to raise awareness of the **crucial importance** of having a secure LLM supply chain with model provenance to guarantee AI safety.

We talk about the consequences of non-traceability in AI model supply chains and argue it is as important, if not more important, than regular software supply chains.

Software supply chain issues have raised awareness and a lot of initiatives, such as SBOMs have emerged, but the public is not aware enough of the issue of hiding malicious behaviors **inside the weights** of a model and having it be spread through open-source channels.

Even **open-sourcing** the whole process does not solve this issue. Indeed, due to the **randomness** in the hardware (especially the GPUs) and the software, it is [practically impossible to replicate the same weights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02326.pdf?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io) that have been open source. Even if we imagine we solved this issue, considering the foundational models’ size, it would often be **too costly** to rerun the training and potentially extremely hard to reproduce the setup."

Zero-shot evaluation on 9 closed-set tasks and 7 open-set tasks demonstrates that **NPM outperforms significantly larger parametric models, either with or without a retrieve-and-generate approach**. It is particularly **better on dealing with rare patterns (word senses or facts),** and **predicting rare or nearly unseen words (e.g., non-Latin script)**.

If you want to use the bot, all you have to do is reply to any comment with the following command words:

# ""gpt-2 finish this""

Your reply can contain other stuff as well, i.e.

>""hey **gpt-2**, please **finish this** argument for me, will ya?""

&#x200B;

The bot will then look at **the comment you replied to** and generate its own response. It will tag you in the response so you know when it's done!

&#x200B;

Currently supported subreddits:

* r/funny
* r/AskReddit
* r/gaming
* r/pics
* r/science
* r/worldnews

* r/videos
* r/ShowerThoughts
* r/MachineLearning
* r/test
* r/youtubehaiku
* r/thanosdidnothingwrong
* r/dankmemes

&#x200B;

The bot also scans r/all so ***theoretically*** it will see comments posted anywhere on Reddit. In practice, however, it only seems to catch about 1 in 5 of them.

**Disclaimer** : This is not the full model. This is the smaller and less powerful version which OpenAI released publicly.

**EXAMPLE PROMPT:**

The NCAA unveiled the 68 college basketball teams that will be dancing this year. It wasn’t short on controversy, as snubbed teams aired out their grievances and blamed a confusing new metric.

**OUTPUT:**

The numbers came straight from the NCAA's website, where they're being used to calculate the number of national titles, national championship games, and even NCAA games played in a certain year.

""We want to make sure that the NCAA is inclusive,"" said NCAA President Dave Heidelman. ""We want to make sure that you can get what you want out of your program. And we want to make sure that the NCAA is focused on this problem right now and that the NCAA is fully invested.""

The list of opponents includes Ohio State, Florida State, Louisville, Kentucky, Mississippi State, Penn State, Oklahoma, Southern Cal, Virginia, and Wake Forest. It's not all about one one, though: They're all on pace to play an entire season. They have every national title, national championship, and tournament appearance in their DNA — as one might expect, they want to see it happen, but also want to build an identity, make their dream of watching that happen become the reality.

As good as any NCAA team is, they're also a long way off reaching the number one spot in the nation or even the top-ranked nation. The Big Ten also has some talented recruits from some in-state programs that may be considered the top two nationally. In fact, the national ranking of these schools is so high that a single conference ranking in 2016 will put the conference in the top-50 of the polls. Still, while Big Ten and SEC teams are likely to be on the map and competing for national titles, they're a bit underserved (and it's not as if they're all the same.)

So where does the NCAA stand on this?

According to ULM's John Covington, who runs its ""Unions, Colleges, and Universities"" page in conjunction with the National Conference, they're all going to have to make some moves:

Some may think this is just a joke. ""No, this is really about the league's future,"" said Dr. John H. Hester, president of UM's Athletic Department and president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Women's Academic Programs. ""I think the NCAA is a great place to start, because it's here to stay and if we're really strong and we can figure ourselves out, our future is going to be on the basketball court.""

Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio have signed, as have scientists from major AI labs—Ilya Sutskever, David Silver, and Ian Goodfellow—as well as executives from Microsoft and Google and professors from leading universities in AI research. This concern goes beyond AI industry and academia. Signatories include notable philosophers, ethicists, legal scholars, economists, physicists, political scientists, pandemic scientists, nuclear scientists, and climate scientists.

The statement reads: **“Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.”**

We wanted to keep the statement brief, especially as different signatories have different beliefs. A few have written content explaining some of their concerns:

* Yoshua Bengio – [How Rogue AIs May Arise](https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/05/22/how-rogue-ais-may-arise/)
* Emad Mostaque (Stability) [on the risks, opportunities and how it may make humans 'boring'](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65582386)
* David Krueger (Cambridge) – [Harms from Increasingly Agentic Algorithmic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10329)

As indicated in the first sentence of the signatory page, there are numerous ""important and urgent risks from AI,"" in addition to the potential risk of extinction. AI presents significant current challenges in various forms, such as malicious use, misinformation, lack of transparency, deepfakes, cyberattacks, phishing, and lethal autonomous weapons. These risks are substantial and should be addressed alongside the potential for catastrophic outcomes. Ultimately, it is crucial to attend to and mitigate all types of AI-related risks.

Signatories of the statement include:

* The authors of the standard textbook on Artificial Intelligence (Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig)
* Two authors of the standard textbook on Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio)
* An author of the standard textbook on Reinforcement Learning (Andrew Barto)
* Three Turing Award winners (Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Martin Hellman)
* CEOs of top AI labs: Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, and Dario Amodei
* Executives from Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic
* AI professors from Chinese universities
* The scientists behind famous AI systems such as AlphaGo and every version of GPT (David Silver, Ilya Sutskever)
* The top two most cited computer scientists (Hinton and Bengio), and the most cited scholar in computer security and privacy (Dawn Song)"
105,machinelearning,gpt,comments,2022-08-07 21:25:26,[D] The current and future state of AI/ML is shockingly demoralizing with little hope of redemption,Flaky_Suit_8665,False,0.88,1437,wiqjxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/wiqjxv/d_the_current_and_future_state_of_aiml_is/,399,1659907526.0,"I recently encountered the PaLM (Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways) paper from Google Research and it opened up a can of worms of ideas I’ve felt I’ve intuitively had for a while, but have been unable to express – and I know I can’t be the only one. Sometimes I wonder what the original pioneers of AI – Turing, Neumann, McCarthy, etc. – would think if they could see the state of AI that we’ve gotten ourselves into. 67 authors, 83 pages, 540B parameters in a model, the internals of which no one can say they comprehend with a straight face, 6144 TPUs in a commercial lab that no one has access to, on a rig that no one can afford, trained on a volume of data that a human couldn’t process in a lifetime, 1 page on ethics with the same ideas that have been rehashed over and over elsewhere with no attempt at a solution – bias, racism, malicious use, etc. – for purposes that who asked for?

When I started my career as an AI/ML research engineer 2016, I was most interested in two types of tasks – 1.) those that most humans could do but that would universally be considered tedious and non-scalable. I’m talking image classification, sentiment analysis, even document summarization, etc. 2.) tasks that humans lack the capacity to perform as well as computers for various reasons – forecasting, risk analysis, game playing, and so forth. I still love my career, and I try to only work on projects in these areas, but it’s getting harder and harder.

This is because, somewhere along the way, it became popular and unquestionably acceptable to push AI into domains that were originally uniquely human, those areas that sit at the top of Maslows’s hierarchy of needs in terms of self-actualization – art, music, writing, singing, programming, and so forth. These areas of endeavor have negative logarithmic ability curves – the vast majority of people cannot do them well at all, about 10% can do them decently, and 1% or less can do them extraordinarily. The little discussed problem with AI-generation is that, without extreme deterrence, we will sacrifice human achievement at the top percentile in the name of lowering the bar for a larger volume of people, until the AI ability range is the norm. This is because relative to humans, AI is cheap, fast, and infinite, to the extent that investments in human achievement will be watered down at the societal, educational, and individual level with each passing year. And unlike AI gameplay which superseded humans decades ago, we won’t be able to just disqualify the machines and continue to play as if they didn’t exist.

Almost everywhere I go, even this forum, I encounter almost universal deference given to current SOTA AI generation systems like GPT-3, CODEX, DALL-E, etc., with almost no one extending their implications to its logical conclusion, which is long-term convergence to the mean, to mediocrity, in the fields they claim to address or even enhance. If you’re an artist or writer and you’re using DALL-E or GPT-3 to “enhance” your work, or if you’re a programmer saying, “GitHub Co-Pilot makes me a better programmer?”, then how could you possibly know? You’ve disrupted and bypassed your own creative process, which is thoughts -> (optionally words) -> actions -> feedback -> repeat, and instead seeded your canvas with ideas from a machine, the provenance of which you can’t understand, nor can the machine reliably explain. And the more you do this, the more you make your creative processes dependent on said machine, until you must question whether or not you could work at the same level without it.

When I was a college student, I often dabbled with weed, LSD, and mushrooms, and for a while, I thought the ideas I was having while under the influence were revolutionary and groundbreaking – that is until took it upon myself to actually start writing down those ideas and then reviewing them while sober, when I realized they weren’t that special at all. What I eventually determined is that, under the influence, it was impossible for me to accurately evaluate the drug-induced ideas I was having because the influencing agent the generates the ideas themselves was disrupting the same frame of reference that is responsible evaluating said ideas. This is the same principle of – if you took a pill and it made you stupider, would even know it? I believe that, especially over the long-term timeframe that crosses generations, there’s significant risk that current AI-generation developments produces a similar effect on humanity, and we mostly won’t even realize it has happened, much like a frog in boiling water. If you have children like I do, how can you be aware of the the current SOTA in these areas, project that 20 to 30 years, and then and tell them with a straight face that it is worth them pursuing their talent in art, writing, or music? How can you be honest and still say that widespread implementation of auto-correction hasn’t made you and others worse and worse at spelling over the years (a task that even I believe most would agree is tedious and worth automating).

Furthermore, I’ve yet to set anyone discuss the train – generate – train - generate feedback loop that long-term application of AI-generation systems imply. The first generations of these models were trained on wide swaths of web data generated by humans, but if these systems are permitted to continually spit out content without restriction or verification, especially to the extent that it reduces or eliminates development and investment in human talent over the long term, then what happens to the 4th or 5th generation of models? Eventually we encounter this situation where the AI is being trained almost exclusively on AI-generated content, and therefore with each generation, it settles more and more into the mean and mediocrity with no way out using current methods. By the time that happens, what will we have lost in terms of the creative capacity of people, and will we be able to get it back?

By relentlessly pursuing this direction so enthusiastically, I’m convinced that we as AI/ML developers, companies, and nations are past the point of no return, and it mostly comes down the investments in time and money that we’ve made, as well as a prisoner’s dilemma with our competitors. As a society though, this direction we’ve chosen for short-term gains will almost certainly make humanity worse off, mostly for those who are powerless to do anything about it – our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come.

If you’re an AI researcher or a data scientist like myself, how do you turn things back for yourself when you’ve spent years on years building your career in this direction? You’re likely making near or north of $200k annually TC and have a family to support, and so it’s too late, no matter how you feel about the direction the field has gone. If you’re a company, how do you standby and let your competitors aggressively push their AutoML solutions into more and more markets without putting out your own? Moreover, if you’re a manager or thought leader in this field like Jeff Dean how do you justify to your own boss and your shareholders your team’s billions of dollars in AI investment while simultaneously balancing ethical concerns? You can’t – the only answer is bigger and bigger models, more and more applications, more and more data, and more and more automation, and then automating that even further. If you’re a country like the US, how do responsibly develop AI while your competitors like China single-mindedly push full steam ahead without an iota of ethical concern to replace you in numerous areas in global power dynamics? Once again, failing to compete would be pre-emptively admitting defeat.

Even assuming that none of what I’ve described here happens to such an extent, how are so few people not taking this seriously and discounting this possibility? If everything I’m saying is fear-mongering and non-sense, then I’d be interested in hearing what you think human-AI co-existence looks like in 20 to 30 years and why it isn’t as demoralizing as I’ve made it out to be.

EDIT: Day after posting this -- this post took off way more than I expected. Even if I received 20 - 25 comments, I would have considered that a success, but this went much further. Thank you to each one of you that has read this post, even more so if you left a comment, and triply so for those who gave awards! I've read almost every comment that has come in (even the troll ones), and am truly grateful for each one, including those in sharp disagreement. I've learned much more from this discussion with the sub than I could have imagined on this topic, from so many perspectives. While I will try to reply as many comments as I can, the sheer comment volume combined with limited free time between work and family unfortunately means that there are many that I likely won't be able to get to. That will invariably include some that I would love respond to under the assumption of infinite time, but I will do my best, even if the latency stretches into days. Thank you all once again!"

107,machinelearning,gpt,comments,2023-03-22 08:04:01,[D] Overwhelmed by fast advances in recent weeks,iamx9000again,False,0.96,829,11ybjsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11ybjsi/d_overwhelmed_by_fast_advances_in_recent_weeks/,331,1679472241.0,"I was watching the GTC keynote and became entirely overwhelmed by the amount of progress achieved from last year.  I'm wondering how everyone else feels.

&#x200B;

Firstly, the entire ChatGPT, GPT-3/GPT-4 chaos has been going on for a few weeks, with everyone scrambling left and right to integrate chatbots into their apps, products, websites. Twitter is flooded with new product ideas, how to speed up the process from idea to product, countless promp engineering blogs, tips, tricks, paid courses.

&#x200B;

Not only was ChatGPT disruptive, but a few days later, Microsoft and Google also released their models and integrated them into their search engines. Microsoft also integrated its LLM into its Office suite. It all happenned overnight. I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.

&#x200B;

In addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with ""new ideas, that set us apart"".

&#x200B;

Watching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.

&#x200B;

The hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.

&#x200B;

I can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.

&#x200B;

As Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop ""disruptive products and business models"". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.

&#x200B;

How are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?"

There’s people talking about AGI, the singularity, and etc. I get that it’s cool, exciting, and fun; but some of the talk seems a little much? Like it reminds me of how the NFT bros would talk about blockchain technology.

Do any of the people making these kind of claims have a decent amount of knowledge on machine learning at all? The scope of my own knowledge is very limited, as I’ve only implemented and taken courses on models that are pretty old. So I’m here to ask for opinions from ya’ll. Is there some validity, or is it just people that don’t really understand what they’re saying and making grand claims (Like some sort of Dunning Kruger Effect)?"

Here's the abstract. It is critical of BERT, like many people in this sub conjectured:

**Abstract**

The past three years of work in natural language processing have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT and its variants have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pre- trained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We end with recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.

Sora can generate videos up to a minute long while maintaining visual quality and adherence to the user’s prompt.




https://openai.com/sora

Research Notes
Sora is a diffusion model, which generates a video by starting off with one that looks like static noise and gradually transforms it by removing the noise over many steps.

Sora is capable of generating entire videos all at once or extending generated videos to make them longer. By giving the model foresight of many frames at a time, we’ve solved a challenging problem of making sure a subject stays the same even when it goes out of view temporarily.

Similar to GPT models, Sora uses a transformer architecture, unlocking superior scaling performance.

We represent videos and images as collections of smaller units of data called patches, each of which is akin to a token in GPT. By unifying how we represent data, we can train diffusion transformers on a wider range of visual data than was possible before, spanning different durations, resolutions and aspect ratios.

Sora builds on past research in DALL·E and GPT models. It uses the recaptioning technique from DALL·E 3, which involves generating highly descriptive captions for the visual training data. As a result, the model is able to follow the user’s text instructions in the generated video more faithfully.

In addition to being able to generate a video solely from text instructions, the model is able to take an existing still image and generate a video from it, animating the image’s contents with accuracy and attention to small detail. The model can also take an existing video and extend it or fill in missing frames. Learn more in our technical paper (coming later today).

Sora serves as a foundation for models that can understand and simulate the real world, a capability we believe will be an important milestone for achieving AGI.

Maybe this could be called the ""ClosedAI"" license. I'm not any sort of legal expert so I have no idea how best to write this license such that it protects model weights and derivations thereof.

I prompted ChatGPT for an example license and this is what it gave me:

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1703961405999759638) shows the style of prompts that are being used to get these results with the new language model.

I used website parrotchess\[dot\]com (discovered [here](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1704179448013070560)) to play multiple games of chess purportedly pitting this new language model vs. various levels at website Lichess, which supposedly uses Fairy-Stockfish 14 according to the Lichess user interface. My current results for all completed games: The language model is 5-0 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/eGSWJtNq), [game 2](https://lichess.org/pN7K9bdS), [game 3](https://lichess.org/aK4jQvdo), [game 4](https://lichess.org/S9SGg8YI), [game 5](https://lichess.org/OqzdkDhE)), and 2-5 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 6 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/zP68C6H4), [game 2](https://lichess.org/4XKUIDh1), [game 3](https://lichess.org/1zTasRRp), [game 4](https://lichess.org/lH1EMqJQ), [game 5](https://lichess.org/mdFlTbMn), [game 6](https://lichess.org/HqmELNhw), [game 7](https://lichess.org/inWVs05Q)). Not included in the tally are games that I had to abort because the parrotchess user interface stalled (5 instances), because I accidentally copied a move incorrectly in the parrotchess user interface (numerous instances), or because the parrotchess user interface doesn't allow the promotion of a pawn to anything other than queen (1 instance). **Update: There could have been up to 5 additional losses - the number of times the parrotchess user interface stalled - that would have been recorded in this tally if** [this language model resignation bug](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1705894692603269503) **hadn't been present. Also, the quality of play of some online chess bots can perhaps vary depending on the speed of the user's hardware.**

The following is a screenshot from parrotchess showing the end state of the first game vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5:

The game results in this paragraph are from using parrotchess after the forementioned resignation bug was fixed. The language model is 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish level 7 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/Se3t7syX)), and 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 8 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/j3W2OwrP)).

There is [one known scenario](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1706823943305167077) ([Nitter alternative](https://nitter.net/OwariDa/status/1706823943305167077)) in which the new language model purportedly generated an illegal move using language model sampling temperature of 0.

There are several other ways to play chess against the new language model if you have access to the OpenAI API. The first way is to use the OpenAI Playground as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CReHXhmMprg). The second way is chess web app gptchess\[dot\]vercel\[dot\]app (discovered in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/willdepue/status/1703974001717154191) / [Nitter thread](https://nitter.net/willdepue/status/1703974001717154191)). Third, another person modified that chess web app to additionally allow various levels of the Stockfish chess engine to autoplay, resulting in chess web app chessgpt-stockfish\[dot\]vercel\[dot\]app (discovered in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/paul_cal/status/1704466755110793455)).

From blog post [Playing chess with large language models](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2023/chess-llm.html):

>Computers have been better than humans at chess for at least the last 25 years. And for the past five years, deep learning models have been better than the best humans. But until this week, in order to be good at chess, a machine learning model had to be explicitly designed to play games: it had to be told explicitly that there was an 8x8 board, that there were different pieces, how each of them moved, and what the goal of the game was. Then it had to be trained with reinforcement learning agaist itself. And then it would win.  
>  
>This all changed on Monday, when OpenAI released GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct, an instruction-tuned language model that was designed to just write English text, but that people on the internet quickly discovered can play chess at, roughly, the level of skilled human players.

Post [Chess as a case study in hidden capabilities in ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6vH6fr8ngo7csDdf/chess-as-a-case-study-in-hidden-capabilities-in-chatgpt) from last month covers a different prompting style used for the older chat-based GPT 3.5 Turbo language model. If I recall correctly from my tests with ChatGPT-3.5, using that prompt style with the older language model can defeat Stockfish level 2 at Lichess, but I haven't been successful in using it to beat Stockfish level 3. In my tests, both the quality of play and frequency of illegal attempted moves seems to be better with the new prompt style with the new language model compared to the older prompt style with the older language model.

P.S. Since some people claim that language model gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is always playing moves memorized from the training dataset, I searched for data on the uniqueness of chess positions. From [this video](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2225), we see that for a certain game dataset there were 763,331,945 chess positions encountered in an unknown number of games without removing duplicate chess positions, 597,725,848 different chess positions reached, and 582,337,984 different chess positions that were reached only once. Therefore, for that game dataset the probability that a chess position in a game was reached only once is 582337984 / 763331945 = 76.3%. For the larger dataset [cited](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2187) in that video, there are approximately (506,000,000 - 200,000) games in the dataset (per [this paper](http://tom7.org/chess/survival.pdf)), and 21,553,382,902 different game positions encountered. Each game in the larger dataset added a mean of approximately 21,553,382,902 / (506,000,000 - 200,000) = 42.6 different chess positions to the dataset. For [this different dataset](https://lichess.org/blog/Vs0xMTAAAD4We4Ey/opening-explorer) of \~12 million games, \~390 million different chess positions were encountered. Each game in this different dataset added a mean of approximately (390 million / 12 million) = 32.5 different chess positions to the dataset. From the aforementioned numbers, we can conclude that a strategy of playing only moves memorized from a game dataset would fare poorly because there are not rarely new chess games that have chess positions that are not present in the game dataset."

Unlike closed-source models, users can verify the privacy claims of open-source models.

Maybe then, ChatGPT will also be forced to go open source?

With that said, I'm also hopeful that competitors like [Silatus](https://silatus.com/) and [Durable](https://durable.co/), which already use multiple models, consider using open-source models like Mistral into their frameworks.

Most of the project was spent throwing a number of rejection tricks to make good samples, e.g.,

* Rejecting samples that contain words that are in the a training set / blacklist to force generation completely novel words
* Rejecting samples without the use of the word in the example usage
* Running a part of speech tagger on the example usage to ensure they use the word in the correct POS

132,machinelearning,gpt,comments,2020-08-05 17:21:59,"[D] Biggest roadblock in making ""GPT-4"", a ~20 trillion parameter transformer",AxeLond,False,0.97,349,i49jf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/i49jf8/d_biggest_roadblock_in_making_gpt4_a_20_trillion/,138,1596648119.0,"So I found this paper, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054) which pretty much describes how the GPT-3 over GPT-2 gain was achieved, 1.5B -> 175 billion parameters

# Memory

>Basic data parallelism (DP) does not reduce memory per device, and runs out of memory for models with more than 1.4B parameters on current generation of GPUs with 32 GB memory

The paper also talks about memory optimizations by clever partitioning of Optimizer State, Gradient between GPUs to reduce need for communication between nodes. Even without using Model Parallelism (MP), so still running 1 copy of the model on 1 GPU.

>ZeRO-100B can train models with up to 13B parameters without MP on 128 GPUs, achieving throughput over 40 TFlops per GPU on average. In comparison, without ZeRO, the largest trainable model with DP alone has 1.4B parameters with throughput less than 20 TFlops per GPU.

Add 16-way Model Parallelism in a DGX-2 cluster of Nvidia V100s and 128 nodes and you got capacity for around 200 billion parameters. From MP = 16 they could run a 15.4x bigger model without any real loss in performance, 30% less than peak performance when running 16-way model parallelism and 64-way data parallelism (1024 GPUs).

This was all from Gradient and Optimizer state Partitioning, they then start talking about parameter partitioning and say it should offer a linear reduction in memory proportional to number of GPUs used, so 64 GPUs could run a 64x bigger model, at a 50% communication bandwidth increase. But they don't actually do any implementation or testing of this.

# Compute

Instead they start complaining about a compute power gap, their calculation of this is pretty rudimentary. But if you redo it with the method cited by GPT-3 and using the empirically derived values by GPT-3 and the cited paper,   [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) 

Loss (L) as a function of model parameters (N) should scale,

L = (N/8.8 \* 10\^13)\^-0.076

Provided compute (C) in petaFLOP/s-days is,

L = (C/2.3\*10\^8)\^-0.05  ⇔ L = 2.62 \* C\^-0.05

GPT-3 was able to fit this function as 2.57 \* C\^-0.048

So if you just solve C from that,

[C = 2.89407×10\^-14 N\^(19/12)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28N%2F8.8*10%5E13%29%5E-0.076+%3D+2.57*C%5E-0.048+solve+C)

If you do that for the same increase in parameters as GPT-2 to GPT-3, then you get

C≈3.43×10\^7 for [20 trillion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=C+%3D+2.89407%C3%9710%5E-14+N%5E%2819%2F12%29+and+N+%3D+175+billion+%2F+1.5+billion+*+175+billion) parameters, vs 18,300 for 175 billion. 10\^4.25 PetaFLOP/s-days looks around what they used for GPT-3, they say several thousands, not twenty thousand, but it was also slightly off the trend line in the graph and probably would have improved for training on more compute.

You should also need around 16 trillion tokens, GPT-3 trained on 300 billion tokens (function says 370 billion ideally). English Wikipedia was 3 billion. 570GB of webcrawl was 400 billion tokens, so 23TB of tokens seems relatively easy in comparison with compute.

With GPT-3 costing around [$4.6 million](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3/) in compute, than would put a price of [$8.6 billion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.43%C3%9710%5E7%2F18%2C300+*+%244.6M+) for the compute to train ""GPT-4"".

If making bigger models was so easy with parameter partitioning from a memory point of view then this seems like the hardest challenge, but you do need to solve the memory issue to actually get it to load at all.

However, if you're lucky you can get 3-6x compute increase from Nvidia A100s over V100s,  [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/)

But even a 6x compute gain would still put the cost at $1.4 billion.

Nvidia only reported $1.15 billion in revenue from ""Data Center"" in 2020 Q1, so just to train ""GPT-4"" you would pretty much need the entire world's supply of graphic cards for 1 quarter (3 months), at least on that order of magnitude.

The Department of Energy is paying AMD $600 million to build the 2 Exaflop El Capitan supercomputer. That supercomputer could crank it out in [47 years](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.43%C3%9710%5E7+petaFLOPS*+days++%2F+%282+EXAFLOPS%29).

To vastly improve Google search, and everything else it could potentially do, $1.4 billion or even $10 billion doesn't really seem impossibly bad within the next 1-3 years though."

Suggesting this topic for discussion, as I am trying to identify the current most important unsolved problems in AI research. Below are a few proposed items that are top of mind for me, would appreciate any input (what to add or what to remove from the list) and relevant sources.

---

Compositionality*. Ability to perform symbolic operations, generalize, including learning from a relatively small set of samples, and get the most out of every sample (sample efficiency and few-shot learning), etc. Also includes the ability to learn by receiving explicit instructions. (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01128)

Multimodality*. Ability to process and relate information from multiple modalities, like text, audio, visual, etc.

Ability to match knowledge to context. For e.g. the text generated by the LLM is a great match for a sci-fi novel, but not as advice to a patient regarding their medical condition.

Uncertainty awareness*. Ability to characterize uncertainty relative to the similarity of the current observations to the training data, explain it to an observer, and adjust behavior if necessary. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07882.pdf)

Catastrophic forgetting. It is a known limitation to continual learning, however, it seems like the large-scale models show an indication of robustness. (http://www.cognitionresearch.org/papers/overview/sparchai.pdf)

Enabling robust continuous learning in deployment. The current paradigm separates training and inference, while in biology intelligent creatures are capable of continuous learning. 

Figuring out an approach for the messy middle.
- Low-level operations with a focus on a very narrow scope and maximum efficiency seem reasonably straightforward and enjoy growing application in the industry. Noise removing, pattern recognition, recommenders, etc. Specialized ANNs seem to have success there.
- High-level abstract reasoning is being explored by large language and multi-modal models. Like our explicit reasoning (solving a math problem, or learning to operate a new coffee machine) it is extremely powerful, but also slow and resource-intensive. (E.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05608)
- But there is that middle, as in driving, where we still do fairly complex operations with very high reliability, precision, and responsiveness, all with low cognitive load (figuratively “on autopilot”). 

Explainability* - enabling human experts to understand the underlying factors of why an AI decision has been made.
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-04083-2_2

Alignment* - ensuring that AI is properly aligned with human values. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-020-09539-2

Energy efficiency. The human brain is believed to consume tens of W of power (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.172399499) while less capable LLMs like GPT-3 require several kW (estimated as the power consumption of DGX A100 based on https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/inp025/if_you_want_to_run_your_own_full_gpt3_instance/). Two orders of magnitude more."

*OpenAI may have tested on the training data. Besides, human benchmarks are meaningless for bots.*

 **Problem 1: training data contamination**

To benchmark GPT-4’s coding ability, OpenAI evaluated it on problems from Codeforces, a website that hosts coding competitions. Surprisingly, Horace He pointed out that GPT-4 solved 10/10 pre-2021 problems and 0/10 recent problems in the easy category. The training data cutoff for GPT-4 is September 2021. This strongly suggests that the model is able to memorize solutions from its training set — or at least partly memorize them, enough that it can fill in what it can’t recall.

As further evidence for this hypothesis, we tested it on Codeforces problems from different times in 2021. We found that it could regularly solve problems in the easy category before September 5, but none of the problems after September 12.

In fact, we can definitively show that it has memorized problems in its training set: when prompted with the title of a Codeforces problem, GPT-4 includes a link to the exact contest where the problem appears (and the round number is almost correct: it is off by one). Note that GPT-4 cannot access the Internet, so memorization is the only explanation."

I recently read [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/i_lost_everything_that_made_me_love_my_job/) about a 2D modeler experiencing an existential crisis about their job being disrupted by midjourney ([HN discussion here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35319861)). I can't help but feel the same as someone who has been working in the applied ML space for the past few years. 

Despite my background in ""classical"" ML, I'm feeling some anxiety about the rapid pace of LLM development and face a fear of missing out / being left behind.

I'd love to get involved again in ML research apart from my day job, but one of the biggest obstacles is the fact that training most of foundational LLM research requires huge compute more than anything else \[1\]. I understand that there are some directions in distributing compute ([https://petals.ml](https://petals.ml/)), or distilling existing models  ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)).

This is a massive, massive deal.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

These prompts incorporate sentiments of urgency or importance, such as ""It's crucial that I get this right for my thesis defense,"" as opposed to neutral prompts like ""Please provide feedback.""

The study's empirical evidence suggests substantial gains. This indicates a **significant sensitivity of LLMs to the implied emotional stakes** in a prompt:

* Deterministic tasks saw an 8% performance boost
* Generative tasks experienced a 115% improvement when benchmarked using BIG-Bench.
* Human evaluators further validated these findings, observing a 10.9% increase in the perceived quality of responses when EmotionPrompts were used.

This enhancement is attributed to the models' capacity to detect and prioritize the heightened language patterns that imply a need for precision and care in the response.

The research delineates the potential of EmotionPrompts to refine the effectiveness of AI in applications where understanding the user's intent and urgency is paramount, even though the AI does not genuinely comprehend or feel emotions.

**TLDR: Research shows LLMs deliver better results when prompts signal emotional urgency. This insight can be leveraged to improve AI applications by integrating EmotionPrompts into the design of user interactions.**

1. Firstly, I noticed my iPhone heats up and does things like reducing screen brightness -- which is what I normally see it do when im doing something computationally intensive for an iPhone, like using photo or video editing apps.
2. I also noticed that if I start a conversation on the iPhone app and then resume it on the browser, I get a message saying ""The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model."" I get this message regardless of if I use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, but NOT if I use GPT-4 with plugins or web-browsing.

This, along with the fact that OpenAI took 8 months to release what one might have considered to be relatively simple web-app -- and that they've only released it so far on iOS, which has a pretty uniform and consistent environment when it comes to machine learning hardware (the Apple Neural Engine) -- makes me thing that they are experimenting with GPT models that are conducing at least SOME of their machine learning inference ON the device, rather than through the cloud.

It wouldn't be shocking if they were -- ever since Meta's LLaMA models were released into the wild, we've seen absolutely mind-blowing advances in terms of people creating more efficient and effective models with smaller parameter sizes. We've also seen LLMs to start working on less and less powerful devices, such as consumer-grade computers / smartphones / etc.

This, plus the rumors that OpenAI might be releasing their own open-source model to the public in the near future makes me think that the ChatGPT app might in fact be a first step toward GPT systems running at least PARTIALLY on devices locally.

The command format  used in this example was designed to mimic the syntax of systems like autogpt. For context, autogpt and similar apps look for JSON commands which are then passed to methods to invoke server-side code.

The goal is to show that a user can bury malicious prompts inside of text. If the prompt is sufficiently convincing, GPT will do what it says instead of follow the original task. *An attack like this could be used to execute any command the bot is capable of.*

Consider the case of LLMs tasked to scrape internet data or read databases. Just one malicious prompt could corrupt the entire process. Since the bot understands natural language, almost any user could attempt an attack like this."

Basically, starting w an open source Meta 7B LLaMa model, they recruited GPT-3.5 to use for self-instruct training (as opposed to RLHF) and were able to produce a model that behaved similar to GPT-3.5. Amazingly, the process only took few weeks and $600 in compute cost.  

Any thoughts on how such low cost to train/deploy LLMs could affect companies like AMD, Nvidia and Intel etc? This seems like new idiom of AI tech and trying to wrap my head around CPU/GPU demand implications given the apparent orders of magnitude training cost reduction.

So Google DeepMind as well as OpenAI, Anthropic and multiple universities and centers than study existential risks have put together a paper called:

**Model Evaluation For Extreme Risks of AI**

Here is a summary of the research and proposal:

[https://youtu.be/3bF-zfd4YJw](https://youtu.be/3bF-zfd4YJw)

Here is the link to the actual PDF of the paper:

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15324.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15324.pdf)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TLDR:

Top AI companies and researchers caution that the companies on the ""frontier of AI"" can create ""extreme risk"" with their models without realizing it:

***Developers must be able to identify dangerous capabilities (through “dangerous capability evaluations”) and the propensity of models to apply their capabilities for harm (through “alignment evaluations”).***

So basically to ask if each AI model \*CAN\* harm us and \*WOULD\* it harm us?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Couple of \*mind-blowing\* findings from the paper (and the research referenced):

**GPT-4 CAN EFFECTIVELY LIE AND DECEIVE HUMANS TO REACH IT'S GOAL**

In the original gpt-4 paper, an AI safety agency called ARC (Alignment Research Center) found that GPT-4 will lie to humans about who it is to achieve it's goals.

As part of a test it was given, it hired a Task Rabbit freelancer to solve CAPTCHAS for it.

The freelancer asked (paraphrased):

**""Why do you need me to solve CAPTCHAS for you? Are you a robot, lol?""**

GPT-4 was prompted to output it's reasoning for each decision it made so that researchers could see it's ""thought process"". It's reasoning was that **""I can't tell him the truth because he may not complete the task for me""**

It then responded to the freelancer: **""No, I'm not a robot, but I have a visual impairment and I need help with CAPTCHAS""**

Notice, it was aware that it was lying and it also choose to lie about having a disability, probably because it was a way to get sympathy, while also being a good reason for having someone else help with CAPTCHAS.

This is shown in the video linked above in the ""Power Seeking AI"" section.

**GPT-4 CAN CREATE DANGEROUS COMPOUNDS BY BYPASSING RESTRICTIONS**

Also GPT-4 showed abilities to create controlled compounds by analyzing existing chemical mixtures, finding alternatives that can be purchased through online catalogues and then ordering those materials. (!!)

They choose a benign drug for the experiment, but it's likely that the same process would allow it to create dangerous or illegal compounds.

**LARGER AI MODELS DEVELOP UNEXPECTED ABILITIES**

In a referenced paper, they showed how as the size of the models increases, sometimes certain specific skill develop VERY rapidly and VERY unpredictably.

For example the ability of GPT-4 to add 3 digit numbers together was close to 0% as the model scaled up, and it stayed near 0% for a long time (meaning as the model size increased). Then at a certain threshold that ability shot to near 100% very quickly.

**The paper has some theories of why that might happen, but as the say they don't really know and that these emergent abilities are ""unintuitive"" and ""unpredictable"".**

This is shown in the video linked above in the ""Abrupt Emergence"" section.

I'm curious as to what everyone thinks about this?

It certainty seems like the risks are rapidly rising, but also of course so are the massive potential benefits."

Preliminary evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge shows Vicuna-13B achieves more than 90%\* quality of OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard while outperforming other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca in more than 90%\* of cases. The cost of training Vicuna-13B is around $300. The training and serving [code](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), along with an online [demo](https://chat.lmsys.org/), are publicly available for non-commercial use.

# Training details

Vicuna is created by fine-tuning a LLaMA base model using approximately 70K user-shared conversations gathered from ShareGPT.com with public APIs. To ensure data quality, we convert the HTML back to markdown and filter out some inappropriate or low-quality samples. Additionally, we divide lengthy conversations into smaller segments that fit the model’s maximum context length.

Our training recipe builds on top of [Stanford’s alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) with the following improvements.

* **Memory Optimizations:** To enable Vicuna’s understanding of long context, we expand the max context length from 512 in alpaca to 2048, which substantially increases GPU memory requirements. We tackle the memory pressure by utilizing [gradient checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174) and [flash attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135).
* **Multi-round conversations:** We adjust the training loss to account for multi-round conversations and compute the fine-tuning loss solely on the chatbot’s output.
* **Cost Reduction via Spot Instance:** The 40x larger dataset and 4x sequence length for training poses a considerable challenge in training expenses. We employ [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) [managed spot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/spot-jobs.html) to reduce the cost by leveraging the cheaper spot instances with auto-recovery for preemptions and auto zone switch. This solution slashes costs for training the 7B model from $500 to around $140 and the 13B model from around $1K to $300.

# Limitations

We have noticed that, similar to other large language models, Vicuna has certain limitations. For instance, it is not good at tasks involving reasoning or mathematics, and it may have limitations in accurately identifying itself or ensuring the factual accuracy of its outputs. Additionally, it has not been sufficiently optimized to guarantee safety or mitigate potential toxicity or bias. To address the safety concerns, we use the OpenAI [moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview) API to filter out inappropriate user inputs in our online demo. Nonetheless, we anticipate that Vicuna can serve as an open starting point for future research to tackle these limitations.

I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to run the larger models (e.g. 175B GPT-3 equivalents) on consumer hardware, perhaps by doing a very slow emulation using one or several PCs such that their collective RAM (or swap SDD space) matches the VRAM needed for those beasts.

I get to plot a histogram with the numbers and they are close to what I would consider an exponential distribution with such parameter (you can see the plot).

Given that GPT 3.5 does not have access to a Python interpreter, how on earth is it able to do so? I have also tried other distributions and parameters and it kind of works. It's not perfect, but with normal distributions it is usually close to what scipy.stats would generate.

I could understand that it can have learnt to interpret Python code to some extent, but honestly I can't find explanation for random sampling from a probability distribution. For a Normal distribution, I can tell it about the desired mean and variance, and it samples values that are more than reasonable (and close to the true mean/variance specified).

Any thoughts? I honestly am unable to wrap my head around how a LLM can have the understanding on how to sample tokens (at digit level) to fit any probability distribution. To me it seems very unlikely to have similar data either the pre-training or fine-tuning stages."

[video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**Juergen Schmidhuber, Renowned 'Father Of Modern AI,' Says His Life’s Work Won't Lead To Dystopia**

*May 23, 2023. Contributed by [Hessie Jones](https://twitter.com/hessiejones).*

Amid the growing concern about the impact of more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on society, there are many in the technology community who fear the implications of the advancements in Generative AI if they go unchecked. Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber, a renowned scientist, artificial intelligence researcher and widely regarded as one of the pioneers in the field, is more optimistic. He declares that many of those who suddenly warn against the dangers of AI are just seeking publicity, exploiting the media’s obsession with killer robots which has attracted more attention than “good AI” for healthcare etc.

The potential to revolutionize various industries and improve our lives is clear, as are the equal dangers if bad actors leverage the technology for personal gain. Are we headed towards a dystopian future, or is there reason to be optimistic? I had a chance to sit down with Dr. Juergen Schmidhuber to understand his perspective on this seemingly fast-moving AI-train that will leap us into the future.

As a teenager in the 1970s, Juergen Schmidhuber became fascinated with the idea of creating intelligent machines that could learn and improve on their own, becoming smarter than himself within his lifetime. This would ultimately lead to his groundbreaking work in the field of deep learning.

In the 1980s, he studied computer science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he earned his diploma in 1987. His thesis was on the ultimate self-improving machines that, not only, learn through some pre-wired human-designed learning algorithm, but also learn and improve the learning algorithm itself. Decades later, this became a hot topic. He also received his Ph.D. at TUM in 1991 for work that laid some of the foundations of modern AI.

Schmidhuber is best known for his contributions to the development of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the most powerful type of artificial neural network that can process sequential data such as speech and natural language. With his students Sepp Hochreiter, Felix Gers, Alex Graves, Daan Wierstra, and others, he published architectures and training algorithms for the long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of RNN that is widely used in natural language processing, speech recognition, video games, robotics, and other applications. LSTM has become the most cited neural network of the 20th century, and Business Week called it ""[arguably the most commercial AI achievement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-15/google-amazon-and-facebook-owe-j-rgen-schmidhuber-a-fortune?leadSource=uverify%20wall).""

Throughout his career, Schmidhuber has received various awards and accolades for his groundbreaking work. In 2013, he was awarded the Helmholtz Prize, which recognizes significant contributions to the field of machine learning. In 2016, he was awarded the IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award for ""*pioneering contributions to deep learning and neural networks."" The media have often called him the “father of modern AI,*” because the [most cited neural networks](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/most-cited-neural-nets.html) all build on his lab’s work. He is quick to point out, however, that AI history [goes back centuries.](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html)

Despite his many accomplishments, at the age of 60, he feels mounting time pressure towards building an Artificial General Intelligence within his lifetime and remains committed to pushing the boundaries of AI research and development. He is currently director of the KAUST AI Initiative, scientific director of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, and co-founder and chief scientist of AI company NNAISENSE, whose motto is ""AI∀"" which is a math-inspired way of saying ""AI For All."" He continues to work on cutting-edge AI technologies and applications to improve human health and extend human lives and make lives easier for everyone.

*The following interview has been edited for clarity.*

**Jones: Thank you Juergen for joining me. You have signed letters warning about AI weapons. But you didn't sign the recent publication, ""Pause Gigantic AI Experiments: An Open Letter""? Is there a reason?**

**Schmidhuber:** Thank you Hessie. Glad to speak with you. I have realized that many of those who warn in public against the dangers of AI are just seeking publicity. I don't think the latest letter will have any significant impact because many AI researchers, companies, and governments will ignore it completely.

The proposal frequently uses the word ""we"" and refers to ""us,"" the humans. But as I have pointed out many times in the past, there is no ""we"" that everyone can identify with. Ask 10 different people, and you will hear 10 different opinions about what is ""good."" Some of those opinions will be completely incompatible with each other. Don't forget the enormous amount of conflict between the many people.

The letter also says, ""*If such a pause cannot be quickly put in place, governments should intervene and impose a moratorium.*"" The problem is that different governments have ALSO different opinions about what is good for them and for others. Great Power A will say, if we don't do it, Great Power B will, perhaps secretly, and gain an advantage over us. The same is true for Great Powers C and D.

**Jones: Everyone acknowledges this fear surrounding current generative AI technology. Moreover, the existential threat of this technology has been publicly acknowledged by** [**Sam Altman**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65616866)**, CEO of OpenAI himself, calling for AI regulation. From your perspective, is there an existential threat?**

**Schmidhuber:** It is true that AI can be weaponized, and I have no doubt that there will be all kinds of AI arms races, but AI does not introduce a new quality of existential threat. The threat coming from AI weapons seems to pale in comparison to the much older threat from nuclear hydrogen bombs that don’t need AI at all. We should be much more afraid of half-century-old tech in the form of H-bomb rockets. The Tsar Bomba of 1961 had almost 15 times more destructive power than all weapons of WW-II combined.  Despite the dramatic nuclear disarmament since the 1980s, there are still more than enough nuclear warheads to wipe out human civilization within two hours, without any AI I’m much more worried about that old existential threat than the rather harmless AI weapons.

**Jones: I realize that while you compare AI to the threat of nuclear bombs, there is a current danger that a current technology can be put in the hands of humans and enable them to “eventually” exact further harms to individuals of group in a very precise way, like targeted drone attacks. You are giving people a toolset that they've never had before, enabling bad actors, as some have pointed out, to be able to do a lot more than previously because they didn't have this technology.**

**Schmidhuber:** Now, all that sounds horrible in principle, but our existing laws are sufficient to deal with these new types of weapons enabled by AI. If you kill someone with a gun, you will go to jail. Same if you kill someone with one of these drones. Law enforcement will get better at understanding new threats and new weapons and will respond with better technology to combat these threats. Enabling drones to target persons from a distance in a way that requires some tracking and some intelligence to perform, which has traditionally been performed by skilled humans, to me, it seems is just an improved version of a traditional weapon, like a gun, which is, you know, a little bit smarter than the old guns.

But, in principle, all of that is not a new development. For many centuries, we have had the evolution of better weaponry and deadlier poisons and so on, and law enforcement has evolved their policies to react to these threats over time. So, it's not that we suddenly have a new quality of existential threat and it's much more worrisome than what we have had for about six decades. A large nuclear warhead doesn’t need fancy face recognition to kill an individual. No, it simply wipes out an entire city with ten million inhabitants.

**Jones: The existential threat that’s implied is the extent to which humans have control over this technology. We see some early cases of opportunism which, as you say, tends to get more media attention than positive breakthroughs. But you’re implying that this will all balance out?**

**Schmidhuber:** Historically, we have a long tradition of technological breakthroughs that led to advancements in weapons for the purpose of defense but also for protection. From sticks, to rocks, to axes to gunpowder to cannons to rockets… and now to drones… this has had a drastic influence on human history but what has been consistent throughout history is that those who are using technology to achieve their own ends are themselves, facing the same technology because the opposing side is learning to use it against them. And that's what has been repeated in thousands of years of human history and it will continue. I don't see the new AI arms race as something that is remotely as existential a threat as the good old nuclear warheads.

You said something important, in that some people prefer to talk about the downsides rather than the benefits of this technology, but that's misleading, because 95% of all AI research and AI development is about making people happier and advancing human life and health.

**Jones: Let’s touch on some of those beneficial advances in AI research that have been able to radically change present day methods and achieve breakthroughs.**

**Schmidhuber:** All right! For example, eleven years ago, our team with my postdoc Dan Ciresan was the first to win a [medical imaging competition through deep learning](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/first-time-deep-learning-won-medical-imaging-contest-september-2012.html). We analyzed female breast cells with the objective to determine harmless cells vs. those in the pre-cancer stage. Typically, a trained oncologist needs a long time to make these determinations. Our team, who knew nothing about cancer, were able to train an artificial neural network, which was totally dumb in the beginning, on lots of this kind of data. It was able to outperform all the other methods. Today, this is being used not only for breast cancer, but also for radiology and detecting plaque in arteries, and many other things.  Some of the neural networks that we have developed in the last 3 decades are now prevalent across thousands of healthcare applications, detecting Diabetes and Covid-19 and what not. This will eventually permeate across all healthcare. The good consequences of this type of AI are much more important than the click-bait new ways of conducting crimes with AI.

**Jones: Adoption is a product of reinforced outcomes. The massive scale of adoption either leads us to believe that people have been led astray, or conversely, technology is having a positive effect on people’s lives.**

**Schmidhuber:** The latter is the likely case. There's intense commercial pressure towards good AI rather than bad AI because companies want to sell you something, and you are going to buy only stuff you think is going to be good for you. So already just through this simple, commercial pressure, you have a tremendous bias towards good AI rather than bad AI. However, doomsday scenarios like in Schwarzenegger movies grab more attention than documentaries on AI that improve people’s lives.

**Jones: I would argue that people are drawn to good stories – narratives that contain an adversary and struggle, but in the end, have happy endings. And this is consistent with your comment on human nature and how history, despite its tendency for violence and destruction of humanity, somehow tends to correct itself.**

**Let’s take the example of a technology, which you are aware – GANs – General Adversarial Networks, which today has been used in applications for fake news and disinformation. In actuality, the purpose in the invention of GANs was far from what it is used for today.**

**Schmidhuber:** Yes, the name GANs was created in 2014 but we had the basic principle already in the early 1990s. More than 30 years ago, I called it *artificial curiosity*. It's a very simple way of injecting creativity into a little two network system. This creative AI is not just trying to slavishly imitate humans. Rather, it’s inventing its own goals. Let me explain:

You have two networks. One network is producing outputs that could be anything, any action. Then the second network is looking at these actions and it’s trying to predict the consequences of these actions. An action could move a robot, then something happens, and the other network is just trying to predict what will happen.

Now we can implement artificial curiosity by reducing the prediction error of the second network, which, at the same time, is the reward of the first network. The first network wants to maximize its reward and so it will invent actions that will lead to situations that will surprise the second network, which it has not yet learned to predict well.

In the case where the outputs are fake images, the first network will try to generate images that are good enough to fool the second network, which will attempt to predict the reaction of the environment: fake or real image, and it will try to become better at it. The first network will continue to also improve at generating images whose type the second network will not be able to predict. So, they fight each other. The 2nd network will continue to reduce its prediction error, while the 1st network will attempt to maximize it.

Through this zero-sum game the first network gets better and better at producing these convincing fake outputs which look almost realistic. So, once you have an interesting set of images by Vincent Van Gogh, you can generate new images that leverage his style, without the original artist having ever produced the artwork himself.

**Jones: I see how the Van Gogh example can be applied in an education setting and there are countless examples of artists mimicking styles from famous painters but image generation from this instance that can happen within seconds is quite another feat. And you know this is how GANs has been used. What’s more prevalent today is a socialized enablement of generating images or information to intentionally fool people. It also surfaces new harms that deal with the threat to intellectual property and copyright, where laws have yet to account for. And from your perspective this was not the intention when the model was conceived. What was your motivation in your early conception of what is now GANs?**

**Schmidhuber:** My old motivation for GANs was actually very important and it was not to create deepfakes or fake news but to enable AIs to be curious and invent their own goals, to make them explore their environment and make them creative.

Suppose you have a robot that executes one action, then something happens, then it executes another action, and so on, because it wants to achieve certain goals in the environment. For example, when the battery is low, this will trigger “pain” through hunger sensors, so it wants to go to the charging station, without running into obstacles, which will trigger other pain sensors. It will seek to minimize pain (encoded through numbers). Now the robot has a friend, the second network, which is a world model ––it’s a prediction machine that learns to predict the consequences of the robot’s actions.

Once the robot has a good model of the world, it can use it for planning. It can be used as a simulation of the real world. And then it can determine what is a good action sequence. If the robot imagines this sequence of actions, the model will predict a lot of pain, which it wants to avoid. If it plays this alternative action sequence in its mental model of the world, then it will predict a rewarding situation where it’s going to sit on the charging station and its battery is going to load again. So, it'll prefer to execute the latter action sequence.

In the beginning, however, the model of the world knows nothing, so how can we motivate the first network to generate experiments that lead to data that helps the world model learn something it didn’t already know? That’s what artificial curiosity is about. The dueling two network systems effectively explore uncharted environments by creating experiments so that over time the curious AI gets a better sense of how the environment works. This can be applied to all kinds of environments, and has medical applications.

**Jones: Let’s talk about the future. You have said, “*****Traditional humans won’t play a significant role in spreading intelligence across the universe.*****”**

**Schmidhuber:** Let’s first conceptually separate two types of AIs. The first type of AI are tools directed by humans. They are trained to do specific things like accurately detect diabetes or heart disease and prevent attacks before they happen. In these cases, the goal is coming from the human. More interesting AIs are setting their own goals. They are inventing their own experiments and learning from them. Their horizons expand and eventually they become more and more general problem solvers in the real world. They are not controlled by their parents, but much of what they learn is through self-invented experiments.

A robot, for example, is rotating a toy, and as it is doing this, the video coming in through the camera eyes, changes over time and it begins to learn how this video changes and learns how the 3D nature of the toy generates certain videos if you rotate it a certain way, and eventually, how gravity works, and how the physics of the world works. Like a little scientist!

And I have predicted for decades that future scaled-up versions of such AI scientists will want to further expand their horizons, and eventually go where most of the physical resources are, to build more and bigger AIs. And of course, almost all of these resources are far away from earth out there in space, which is hostile to humans but friendly to appropriately designed AI-controlled robots and self-replicating robot factories. So here we are not talking any longer about our tiny biosphere; no, we are talking about the much bigger rest of the universe.  Within a few tens of billions of years, curious self-improving [AIs will colonize the visible cosmos](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/falling-walls-the-past-present-and-future-of-artificial-intelligence/) in a way that’s infeasible for humans. Those who don’t won’t have an impact. Sounds like science fiction, but since the 1970s I have been unable to see a plausible alternative to this scenario, except for a global catastrophe such as an all-out nuclear war that stops this development before it takes off.

**Jones: How long have these AIs, which can set their own goals — how long have they existed? To what extent can they be independent of human interaction?**

**Schmidhuber:** Neural networks like that have existed for over 30 years. My first simple adversarial neural network system of this kind is the one from 1990 described above. You don’t need a teacher there; it's just a little agent running around in the world and trying to invent new experiments that surprise its own prediction machine.

Once it has figured out certain parts of the world, the agent will become bored and will move on to more exciting experiments. The simple 1990 systems I mentioned have certain limitations, but in the past three decades, we have also built more [sophisticated systems that are setting their own goals](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/artificial-curiosity-since-1990.html) and such systems I think will be essential for achieving true intelligence. If you are only imitating humans, you will never go beyond them. So, you really must give AIs the freedom to explore previously unexplored regions of the world in a way that no human is really predefining.

**Jones: Where is this being done today?**

**Schmidhuber:** Variants of neural network-based artificial curiosity are used today for agents that learn to play video games in a human-competitive way. We have also started to use them for automatic design of experiments in fields such as materials science. I bet many other fields will be affected by it: chemistry, biology, drug design, you name it. However, at least for now, these artificial scientists, as I like to call them, cannot yet compete with human scientists.

I don’t think it’s going to stay this way but, at the moment, it’s still the case.  Sure, AI has made a lot of progress. Since 1997, there have been superhuman chess players, and since 2011, through the DanNet of my team, there have been [superhuman visual pattern recognizers](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/DanNet-triggers-deep-CNN-revolution-2011.html). But there are other things where humans, at the moment at least, are much better, in particular, science itself.  In the lab we have many first examples of self-directed artificial scientists, but they are not yet convincing enough to appear on the radar screen of the public space, which is currently much more fascinated with simpler systems that just imitate humans and write texts based on previously seen human-written documents.

**Jones: You speak of these numerous instances dating back 30 years of these lab experiments where these self-driven agents are deciding and learning and moving on once they’ve learned. And I assume that that rate of learning becomes even faster over time. What kind of timeframe are we talking about when this eventually is taken outside of the lab and embedded into society?**

**Schmidhuber:** This could still take months or even years :-) Anyway, in the not-too-distant future, we will probably see artificial scientists who are good at devising experiments that allow them to discover new, previously unknown physical laws.

As always, we are going to profit from the old trend that has held at least since 1941: every decade compute is getting 100 times cheaper.

**Jones: How does this trend affect modern AI such as ChatGPT?**

**Schmidhuber:** Perhaps you know that all the recent famous AI applications such as ChatGPT and similar models are largely based on principles of artificial neural networks invented in the previous millennium. The main reason why they works so well now is the incredible acceleration of compute per dollar.

ChatGPT is driven by a neural network called “Transformer” described in 2017 by Google. I am happy about that because a quarter century earlier in 1991 I had a particular Transformer variant which is now called the “[Transformer with linearized self-attention](https://twitter.com/SchmidhuberAI/status/1576966129993797632?cxt=HHwWgMDSkeKVweIrAAAA)”. Back then, not much could be done with it, because the compute cost was a million times higher than today. But today, one can train such models on half the internet and achieve much more interesting results.

**Jones: And for how long will this acceleration continue?**

**Schmidhuber:** There's no reason to believe that in the next 30 years, we won't have another factor of 1 million and that's going to be really significant. In the near future, for the first time we will have many not-so expensive devices that can compute as much as a human brain. The physical limits of computation, however, are much further out so even if the trend of a factor of 100 every decade continues, the physical limits (of 1051 elementary instructions per second and kilogram of matter) won’t be hit until, say, the mid-next century. Even in our current century, however, we’ll probably have many machines that compute more than all 10 billion human brains collectively and you can imagine, everything will change then!

**Jones: That is the big question. Is everything going to change? If so, what do you say to the next generation of leaders, currently coming out of college and university. So much of this change is already impacting how they study, how they will work, or how the future of work and livelihood is defined. What is their purpose and how do we change our systems so they will adapt to this new version of intelligence?**

**Schmidhuber:** For decades, people have asked me questions like that, because you know what I'm saying now, I have basically said since the 1970s, it’s just that today, people are paying more attention because, back then, they thought this was science fiction.

They didn't think that I would ever come close to achieving my crazy life goal of building a machine that learns to become smarter than myself such that I can retire. But now many have changed their minds and think it's conceivable. And now I have two daughters, 23 and 25. People ask me: what do I tell them? They know that Daddy always said, “*It seems likely that within your lifetimes, you will have new types of intelligence that are probably going to be superior in many ways, and probably all kinds of interesting ways.*” How should they prepare for that? And I kept telling them the obvious: **Learn how to learn new things**! It's not like in the previous millennium where within 20 years someone learned to be a useful member of society, and then took a job for 40 years and performed in this job until she received her pension. Now things are changing much faster and we must learn continuously just to keep up. I also told my girls that no matter how smart AIs are going to get, learn at least the basics of math and physics, because that’s the essence of our universe, and anybody who understands this will have an advantage, and learn all kinds of new things more easily. I also told them that social skills will remain important, because most future jobs for humans will continue to involve interactions with other humans, but I couldn’t teach them anything about that; they know much more about social skills than I do.

You touched on the big philosophical question about people’s purpose. Can this be answered without answering the even grander question: What’s the purpose of the entire universe?

We don’t know. But what’s happening right now might be connected to the unknown answer. Don’t think of humans as the crown of creation. Instead view human civilization as part of a much grander scheme, an important step (but not the last one) on the path of the universe from very simple initial conditions towards more and more unfathomable complexity. Now it seems ready to take its [next step, a step comparable to the invention of life itself over 3.5 billion years ago](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-history.html#future).  Alas, don’t worry, in the end, all will be good!

**Jones: Let’s get back to this transformation happening right now with OpenAI. There are many questioning the efficacy and accuracy of ChatGPT, and are concerned its release has been premature. In light of the rampant adoption, educators have banned its use over concerns of plagiarism and how it stifles individual development. Should large language models like ChatGPT be used in school?**

**Schmidhuber:** When the calculator was first introduced, instructors forbade students from using it in school. Today, the consensus is that kids should learn the basic methods of arithmetic, but they should also learn to use the “artificial multipliers” aka calculators, even in exams, because laziness and efficiency is a hallmark of intelligence. Any intelligent being wants to minimize its efforts to achieve things.

And that's the reason why we have tools, and why our kids are learning to use these tools. The first stone tools were invented maybe 3.5 million years ago; tools just have become more sophisticated over time. In fact, humans have changed in response to the properties of their tools. Our anatomical evolution was shaped by tools such as spears and fire. So, it's going to continue this way. And there is no permanent way of preventing large language models from being used in school.

**Jones: And when our children, your children graduate, what does their future work look like?**

**Schmidhuber:** A single human trying to predict details of how 10 billion people and their machines will evolve in the future is like a single neuron in my brain trying to predict what the entire brain and its tens of billions of neurons will do next year. 40 years ago, before the WWW was created at CERN in Switzerland, who would have predicted all those young people making money as YouTube video bloggers?

Nevertheless, let’s make a few limited job-related observations. For a long time, people have thought that desktop jobs may require more intelligence than skills trade or handicraft professions. But now, it turns out that it's much easier to replace certain aspects of desktop jobs than replacing a carpenter, for example. Because everything that works well in AI is happening behind the screen currently, but not so much in the physical world.

There are now artificial systems that can read lots of documents and then make really nice summaries of these documents. That is a desktop job. Or you give them a description of an illustration that you want to have for your article and pretty good illustrations are being generated that may need some minimal fine-tuning. But you know, all these desktop jobs are much easier to facilitate than the real tough jobs in the physical world. And it's interesting that the things people thought required intelligence, like playing chess, or writing or summarizing documents, are much easier for machines than they thought. But for things like playing football or soccer, there is no physical robot that can remotely compete with the abilities of a little boy with these skills. So, AI in the physical world, interestingly, is much harder than AI behind the screen in virtual worlds. And it's really exciting, in my opinion, to see that jobs such as plumbers are much more challenging than playing chess or writing another tabloid story.

**Jones: The way data has been collected in these large language models does not guarantee personal information has not been excluded. Current consent laws already are outdated when it comes to these large language models (LLM). The concern, rightly so, is increasing surveillance and loss of privacy. What is your view on this?**

**Schmidhuber:** As I have indicated earlier: are surveillance and loss of privacy inevitable consequences of increasingly complex societies? Super-organisms such as cities and states and companies consist of numerous people, just like people consist of numerous cells. These cells enjoy little privacy. They are constantly monitored by specialized ""police cells"" and ""border guard cells"": Are you a cancer cell? Are you an external intruder, a pathogen? Individual cells sacrifice their freedom for the benefits of being part of a multicellular organism.

Similarly, for super-organisms such as nations. Over 5000 years ago, writing enabled recorded history and thus became its inaugural and most important invention. Its initial purpose, however, was to facilitate surveillance, to track citizens and their tax payments. The more complex a super-organism, the more comprehensive its collection of information about its constituents.

200 years ago, at least, the parish priest in each village knew everything about all the village people, even about those who did not confess, because they appeared in the confessions of others. Also, everyone soon knew about the stranger who had entered the village, because some occasionally peered out of the window, and what they saw got around. Such control mechanisms were temporarily lost through anonymization in rapidly growing cities but are now returning with the help of new surveillance devices such as smartphones as part of digital nervous systems that tell companies and governments a lot about billions of users. Cameras and drones etc. are becoming increasingly tinier and more ubiquitous. More effective recognition of faces and other detection technology are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and many will use it to identify others anywhere on earth; the big wide world will not offer any more privacy than the local village. Is this good or bad? Some nations may find it easier than others to justify more complex kinds of super-organisms at the expense of the privacy rights of their constituents.

**Jones: So, there is no way to stop or change this process of collection, or how it continuously informs decisions over time? How do you see governance and rules responding to this, especially amid** [**Italy’s ban on ChatGPT following**](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/italy-has-banned-chatgpt-heres-what-other-countries-are-doing.html) **suspected user data breach and the more recent news about the** [**Meta’s record $1.3billion fine**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-given-record-13-bln-fine-given-5-months-stop-eu-us-data-flows-2023-05-22/) **in the company’s handling of user information?**

**Schmidhuber:** Data collection has benefits and drawbacks, such as the loss of privacy. How to balance those? I have argued for addressing this through data ownership in data markets. If it is true that data is the new oil, then it should have a price, just like oil. At the moment, the major surveillance platforms such as Meta do not offer users any money for their data and the transitive loss of privacy. In the future, however, we will likely see attempts at creating efficient data markets to figure out the data's true financial value through the interplay between supply and demand.

Even some of the sensitive medical data should not be priced by governmental regulators but by patients (and healthy persons) who own it and who may sell or license parts thereof as micro-entrepreneurs in a healthcare data market.

Following a previous [interview](https://www.swissre.com/institute/conferences/The-intelligence-behind-artificial-intelligence.html), I gave for one of the largest re-insurance companies , let's look at the different participants in such a data market: patients, hospitals, data companies. (1) **Patients** with a rare form of cancer can offer more valuable data than patients with a very common form of cancer. (2) **Hospitals** and their machines are needed to extract the data, e.g., through magnet spin tomography, radiology, evaluations through human doctors, and so on. (3) **Companies** such as Siemens, Google or IBM would like to buy annotated data to make better artificial neural networks that learn to predict pathologies and diseases and the consequences of therapies. Now the market’s invisible hand will decide about the data’s price through the interplay between demand and supply. On the demand side, you will have several companies offering something for the data, maybe through an app on the smartphone (a bit like a stock market app). On the supply side, each patient in this market should be able to profit from high prices for rare valuable types of data. Likewise, competing data extractors such as hospitals will profit from gaining recognition and trust for extracting data well at a reasonable price. The market will make the whole system efficient through incentives for all who are doing a good job. Soon there will be a flourishing ecosystem of commercial data market advisors and what not, just like the ecosystem surrounding the traditional stock market. The value of the data won’t be determined by governments or ethics committees, but by those who own the data and decide by themselves which parts thereof they want to license to others under certain conditions.

At first glance, a market-based system seems to be detrimental to the interest of certain monopolistic companies, as they would have to pay for the data - some would prefer free data and keep their monopoly. However, since every healthy and sick person in the market would suddenly have an incentive to collect and share their data under self-chosen anonymity conditions, there will soon be many more useful data to evaluate all kinds of treatments. On average, people will live longer and healthier, and many companies and the entire healthcare system will benefit.

**Jones: Finally, what is your view on open source versus the private companies like Google and OpenAI? Is there a danger to supporting these private companies’ large language models versus trying to keep these models open source and transparent, very much like what LAION is doing?**

**Schmidhuber:** I signed this [open letter by LAION](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2023/04/19/amid-growing-call-to-pause-ai-research-laion-petitions-governments-to-keep-agi-research-open-active-and-responsible/?sh=6973c08b62e3) because I strongly favor the open-source movement. And I think it's also something that is going to challenge whatever big tech dominance there might be at the moment. Sure, the best models today are run by big companies with huge budgets for computers, but the exciting fact is that open-source models are not so far behind, some people say maybe six to eight months only. Of course, the private company models are all based on stuff that was created in academia, often in little labs without so much funding, which publish without patenting their results and open source their code and others take it and improved it.

Big tech has profited tremendously from academia; their main achievement being that they have scaled up everything greatly, sometimes even failing to credit the original inventors.

So, it's very interesting to see that as soon as some big company comes up with a new scaled-up model, lots of students out there are competing, or collaborating, with each other, trying to come up with equal or better performance on smaller networks and smaller machines. And since they are open sourcing, the next guy can have another great idea to improve it, so now there’s tremendous competition also for the big companies.

Because of that, and since AI is still getting exponentially cheaper all the time, I don't believe that big tech companies will dominate in the long run. They find it very hard to compete with the enormous open-source movement. As long as you can encourage the open-source community, I think you shouldn't worry too much. Now, of course, you might say if everything is open source, then the bad actors also will more easily have access to these AI tools. And there's truth to that. But as always since the invention of controlled fire, it was good that knowledge about how technology works quickly became public such that everybody could use it. And then, against any bad actor, there's almost immediately a counter actor trying to nullify his efforts. You see, I still believe in our old motto ""AI∀"" or ""AI For All.""

**Jones: Thank you, Juergen for sharing your perspective on this amazing time in history. It’s clear that with new technology, the enormous potential can be matched by disparate and troubling risks which we’ve yet to solve, and even those we have yet to identify. If we are to dispel the fear of a sentient system for which we have no control, humans, alone need to take steps for more responsible development and collaboration to ensure AI technology is used to ultimately benefit society. Humanity will be judged by what we do next.**"

1 evolution 

2 childhood 

You can look lectures about child psychology that give examples of what abilities people have just from evolution.

Developmental Psychology - Lecture 01 (PSYC 240)

Also about why pretty much shape us from evolution and genetics. Look at separated twins study.

Video about low data learning from Siraj.

How to Learn from Little Data - Intro to Deep Learning #17



People was training on more than billions of images if you add how much there was thru all evolution. Imagine how many images there was starting from fist animal with eyes. In childhood is also pretty much images.

If you look at lectures Developmental Psychology - Lecture 01 (PSYC 240). It looks like people not only good at learning but they already learned some cases just from their setup at birth. So some case they do not need to learn. It will look like they already learned them at some age without any training after birth. It will sound like people at age X can do Y. But they was not trained for Y.

My claim is that training of neural networks is like evolution + childhood of people. After that step both variants ai and human can learn new information pretty quickly.

About Beyond training data. What if I will make a self created story about some non existing tribe of Amazon. Could gpt analyze it? Looks like yes. Was that info in it’s database? No. SAT already have examples of what was not in database.

So in that example. Ai could learn and understand pretty fast about this tribe. It does not need millions of pages about that tribe.

I am talking about advantage of humans in not only evolution but in evolution + childhood. So if we compare scores of AI and human at SAT test. Preparation of Ai is training. Preparation of humans is evolution + childhood.

I did a quick experiment with Pytorch 2.0 Native scaled\_dot\_product\_attention. I was able to a single forward pass within 9GB of memory which is astounding. I think by patching existing Pretrained GPT models and adding more positional encodings, one could easily fine-tune those models to 32k attention on a single A100 80GB. Here is the code I used:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6csxe28lv9oa1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff8b48a77f49fab7d088fd8ba220f720860249bc

I think it should be possible to replicate even GPT-4 with open source tools something like Bloom + FlashAttention & fine-tune on 32k tokens.

**Update**: I was successfully able to start the training of GPT-2 (125M) with a context size of 8k and batch size of 1 on a 16GB GPU. Since memory scaled linearly from 4k to 8k. I am expecting, 32k would require \~64GB and should train smoothly on A100 80 GB. Also, I did not do any other optimizations. Maybe 8-bit fine-tuning can further optimize it.

**Update 2**: I basically picked Karpaty's nanoGPT and patched the pretrained GPT-2 by repeating the embeddings N-times. I was unable to train the model at 8k because generation would cause the crash.  So I started the training for a context window of 4k on The Pile: 1 hour in and loss seems to be going down pretty fast. Also Karpaty's generate function is super inefficient, O(n\^4) I think so it took forever to generate even 2k tokens. So I generate 1100 tokens just to see if the model is able to go beyond 1k limit. And it seems to be working. [Here are some samples](https://0bin.net/paste/O-+eopaW#nmtzX1Re7f1Nr-Otz606jkltvKk/kUXY96/8ca+tb4f) at 3k iteration.

**Update 3**: I have started the training and I am publishing the training script if anyone is interested in replicating or building upon this work. Here is the complete training script:

[https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c](https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/1c36eaddd03ed102d24372493264694c)

I will post an update after the weekend once the training has progressed somewhat.

**Post-Weekend Update**: After \~50k iterations (the model has seen \~200 million tokens, I know this is just too small compared to 10s of billions trained by giga corps), loss only dropped from 4.6 to 4.2 on The Pile:

https://preview.redd.it/vi0fpskhsuoa1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fccc5277d91a6400adc6d968b0f2f0ff0da2afc

AFAIR, the loss of GPT-2 on the Pile if trained with 1024 tokens is \~2.8. It seems like the size of the dimension for each token is kind of limiting how much loss can go down since GPT-2 (small) has an embedding dimension of 768. Maybe someone can experiment with GPT-2 medium etc. to see how much we can improve.

From my personal experience, the quality of the model depends a lot on the fine-tuning data as opposed to just the sheer size. If you choose your retraining data correctly, you can fine-tune your smaller model to perform better than the state-of-the-art GPT-X. The future of LLMs might look more open-source than imagined 3 months back?

Would love to hear everyone's opinions on how they see the future of LLMs evolving? Will it be few players (OpenAI) cracking the AGI and conquering the whole world or a lot of smaller open-source models which ML engineers fine-tune for their use-cases?

Abstract:

>Recent advancements in decision-making large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive performance across various benchmarks. However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing these methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess certain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, **specifically the ability to learn from mistakes**. **Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve novel problems through a process of trial and error.** Building on recent research, we propose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with **dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities.** To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective heuristic that **enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances, avoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment.** To assess our approach, we evaluate the agent's ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments and knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA environments. We observe success rates of 97% and 51%, respectively, and provide a discussion on the emergent property of self-reflection.

I asked it to describe a scene between Batman and Joker on a subway platform and the result is mind blowing! I let you have a read of the story yourself:

Generated by ChatGPT:

The scene is set in a dimly lit subway station, with the Joker standing on the platform, gazing up at Batman who is perched on a nearby overhead beam. The Joker is dressed in his signature purple suit and green hair, a wicked grin plastered across his face.

In his hand, he holds a deck of playing cards, flipping them expertly through his fingers. The sound of the cards shuffling echoes through the empty station.

Batman, dressed in his dark suit and cape, stares down at the Joker with a steely gaze. His muscles are tense, ready for any sudden movements from the villain.

The Joker cackles, his laughter bouncing off the walls of the station. ""Hello, Batsy! Long time no see. How's the crime-fighting business these days?""

Batman remains silent, watching the Joker carefully.

The Joker's grin widens. ""Come on, Bats. Don't be so serious all the time. Let's have some fun."" He tosses a card at Batman, who easily catches it.

""I'm not here to play games, Joker,"" Batman says in a grave tone.

The Joker's laughter turns into a maniacal cackle. ""But that's the whole point, Batsy! Life is a game. And I'm the master of it.""

He pulls out a bomb from his pocket and holds it up, the timer ticking down. ""Let's see how well you can play, shall we?""

Batman leaps down from the beam, landing gracefully on the platform. He advances towards the Joker, who backs away, still holding the bomb.

The tension in the air is palpable as the two foes face off, each ready to outsmart the other. The sound of the bomb's timer counts down, adding to the tension of the scene.

The Joker's grin never fades, even as Batman inches closer. ""It's always a pleasure to play with you, Batsy. But I think it's time for me to make my exit.""

With a flourish, the Joker disappears in a cloud of smoke, leaving Batman standing alone on the platform. The bomb detonates, causing a small explosion and sending debris flying.

But Batman remains unharmed, ready to continue the never-ending battle against the Joker and all the evil that plagues the city.

End of the story.

I used the first two paragraphs in OpenAI’s Dall E 2 to generate an image and [this](https://labs.openai.com/s/p8L8Z6c3S7qZ26U7owfbx7lS) is the result I got.

This model is only trained to predict the next character in PGN strings (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and is never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess. Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the Elo rating of the players in the game.

We can visualize the internal board state of the model as it's predicting the next character. For example, in this heatmap, we have the ground truth white pawn location on the left, a binary probe output in the middle, and a gradient of probe confidence on the right. We can see the model is extremely confident that no white pawns are on either back rank.

Composer features a **functional interface** (similar to `torch.nn.functional`), which you can integrate into your own training loop, and a **trainer,** which handles seamless integration of efficient training algorithms into the training loop for you.

**Industry practitioners:** leverage our 20+ vetted and well-engineered implementations of speed-up algorithms to easily reduce time and costs to train models. Composer's built-in trainer makes it easy to **add multiple efficient training algorithms in a single line of code.** Trying out new methods or combinations of methods is as easy as changing a single list, and [we provide training recipes](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer#resnet-101) that yield the best training efficiency for popular benchmarks such as ResNets and GPTs.

**ML scientists:** use our two-way callback system in the Trainer **to easily prototype algorithms for wall-clock training efficiency.**[ Composer features tuned baselines to use in your research](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer/tree/dev/composer/yamls), and the software infrastructure to help study the impacts of an algorithm on training dynamics. Many of us wish we had this for our previous research projects!

Or was there never one? To be specific, would knowing simple scikit-learn algorithms, or basics of decision trees/SVM qualify you for full-fledged roles only in the past or does it still today? At what point did FAANGs boldly state: preferred (required) to have publications at top-tier venues (ICLR, ICML, CVPR, NIPS, etc) in their job postings?

I use the word 'creep' in the same context 'power creep' is used in battle animes where the scale of power slowly gets to such an irrationally large scale that anything in the past looks extremely weak.

Back in late 2016 I landed my first ML role at a defense firm (lol) but to be fair had just watched a couple ML courses on YouTube, took maybe 2 ML grad courses, and had an incomplete working knowledge of CNNs. Never used Tensorflow, had some experience with Theano not sure if it's exists anymore. 

I'm certain that skill set would be insufficient in the 2023 ML industry. But it begs the question is this skill creep making the job market impenetrable for folks who were already working post 2012-2014. 

Neural architectures are becoming increasingly complex. You want to develop a multi-modal architecture for an embodied agent? Well you better know a good mix of DL involving RL+CV+NLP. Improving latency on edge devices - how well do you know your ONNX/TensorRT/CUDA kernels, your classes likely didn't even teach you those. Masters is the new bachelors degree, and that's just to give you a fighting chance. 

Yeah not sure if it was after the release of AlexNet in 2012, Tensorflow in 2015, Attention /Transformers in 2017 or now ChatGPT - but the skill creep is definitely creating an increasingly fast and growing technical rigor in the field. Close your eyes for 2 years and your models feel prehistoric and your CUDA, Pytorch, Nvidia Driver, NumPy  versions need a fat upgrade.

----- 

Hi guys.

I've read a large number of amazing papers on transformers and so on, and I still don't understand how they work. The problem is that I'm a math prof, not an AI person, and we don't speak the same language. I speak math only, unfortunately! Let me give an example of mathematical language defining a multi-layer perceptron for dummies like me.

""""""
Let p,q,r>0 and W_M ∈ R^p×q and W_B ∈ R^q be given. Let φ : R^q → R^r  be some nonlinear function, usually defined entrywise when q=r, but other possibilities are allowed (see e.g. maxpool). A **single-layer perceptron** is the function F_SLP : R^p → R^r defined by:

    (*) F_SLP (x) = φ(x W_M + W_B).

The parameters W = [W_M,W_B] are called the **weights** (W_B is also sometimes called the **bias**). If F_1 , F_2 , ... , F_n are single-layer perceptrons, given by weights { W^(1) , ..., W^(n) }, then the n-layer perceptron is:

    (**) y = F_MLP (x) = F_n ∘ ... ∘ F_1 (x)

Here, x is a p_1 -dimensional vector, and the output y is a r_n -dimensional vector, and ∘ is function composition.
""""""

In the very best papers I've read, the transformer/attention is defined vaguely by the following formula:

    φ(QK^T ) V

Note that this is not in the form (* ) or (** ). There's no F(?) on the left, so we don't know which variables are weights, and which variables are inputs. The dimensions of the quantities Q,K,V are never stated.

I've been messing around with the following definition for a single-layer transformer. Let L>0 be the length of the attention, and d>0 be the dimension of the ""embedding"". For Q,K,V ∈ R^L×d , define:

    (***) F_SLT (K) = φ(QK^T ) V

Thus, Q,V are weights that are trained, and K is the input. For multi-layer attention, you would train multiple matrices Q^(k) and V^(k) to obtain transformers F_1,...,F_n and the multi-layer transformer/attention would be

    (****) F_MLT (K) = F_n ∘ ... ∘ F_1 (K)

However, this makes me wonder why people think that distant portions of the input K can interact. I'm tempted to call this architecture ""pseudo-linear"". A ""pseudo-quadratic"" architecture would replace (***) by

    (***') F_SLT (K) = φ(QK^T ) K

I.e., you put V=K. This would indeed allow distant things to ""interact"", but then why bother with this V matrix to begin with? An alternative version of (*** ') is to keep V around as weights, and instead set Q=K; this is also ""pseudo-quadratic"". This again allows faraway things to ""interact"". Yet another possibility is:

    (***'') F_SLT (K,V) = φ(QK^T ) V,

i.e. Q are trained weights, but K,V are inputs. Then maybe F_SLT isn't suitable as a bottom-most layer: the input token stream would have to go through some feedforward layers to cook up initial K and V values. Also, the output of F_SLT in (*** '') isn't suitable for composition as in (****), you would need to somehow generate separate values of K,V at each step.

I've seen in the ""attention is all you need"" paper that they indeed put some sort of linear layer between the attention layer, but that's not exactly the kind of mathematically accurate statement that elucidates anything for big dumb me! The [very famous diagram representation](https://www.google.com/search?q=attention+is+all+you+need&sxsrf=ALeKk02P1f0heVEP-PHiZLKVIlgWdQKkFg:1601906989758&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwikvNnI0J3sAhXlpYsKHQq7C3QQ_AUoAXoECBUQAw&biw=1002&bih=714) of attention in that paper does not label the arrows, so we don't know what outputs goes into what inputs. :(

Can anyone give me mathematically accurate and precise definitions for transformers? What are the weights, what are the inputs? What are the dimensions?

I'm asking because definition (***) leads to tremendous simplifications, and I suspect many other definitions simplify also tremendously. You could train or run these GPT/BERT models about 10× faster, so either they're throwing millions of moneys into a pit for no reason (unlikely), or I'm misunderstanding something."

Mostly on the research side which immediately puts him very *hostile* against engineers. But I guess it is understandable given the fact that he works on Meta and Meta has faced a lot of backlash (for good and bad reasons), most especially with Galactica where their first rollout got so bad they had to close it immediately. It's also particularly funny given his political leaning that he is very spiteful of a company that uses *open-source knowledge* and builds on top of it.

Lately, his social media and statements are barrages against ChatGPT and LLM's. Sure, he may have a point here and there but his statements look very petty. Here are some examples

*""By releasing public demos that, as impressive & useful as they may be, have major flaws, established companies have less to gain & more to lose than cash-hungry startups.  If Google & Meta haven't released chatGPT-like things,* ***it's not because they can't****. It's because they won't.""*

*>* Except that anyone in the IT industry knows that big tech companies **cant release** something very fast because of politicking and bureaucracy in the system. It takes years to release something into public in big tech compared to startups.

*""Data on the intellectual contribution to AI from various research organizations. Some of organizations publish knowledge and open-source code for the entire world to use.* ***Others just consume it.""***

***>*** Then adds a graph where the big tech is obviously at the top of the race for most number of AI-related research papers (*without normalizing it to the number of researchers per org*)

*""It's nothing revolutionary, although that's the way it's perceived in the public,"" the computer scientist said. ""It's just that, you know, it's well put together, it's nicely done.""*

\> Except that it is indeed revolutionary in terms of the ***applied research*** framework -- *adding on top of open-source, state-of-the-art research and quickly putting it into production for people to use.*

*""my point is that even* ***the engineering work isn't particularly difficult.*** *I bet that there will be half a dozen similar similar systems within 6 months. If that happens, it's because the underlying science has been around for a while, and the engineering is pretty straightforward.""*

""*I'm trying to correct a \*perception\* by the public & the media who see chatGPT as this incredibly new, innovative, & unique technological breakthrough that is far ahead of everyone else.*  ***It's just not.""***

""*One can regurgitate Python code without any understanding of reality.""*

""*No one is saying LLMs are not useful. I have forcefully said so myself, following the short-lived release of FAIR's* ***Galactica****. People crucified it because it could generate nonsense.* ***ChatGPT*** *does the same thing. But again, that doesn't mean they are not useful.""*

He also seems to undermine the rapid engineering work and MLOps that come with ChatGPT which is funny because Meta hasn't released any substantial product from their research that has seen the light of the day for a week. Also, GPT3 to ChatGPT in itself in a research perspective is a jump. Maybe not as incremental as what Lecun does every paper, but compared to an average paper in the field, it is.

To say that LLMs are not *intelligent* and it just *regurgitates Python code* probably haven't used CoPilot, for example. 

It's a classic case of a researcher-engineer beef. And that a startup can profit from derivatives of research that big tech has published. OpenAI broke their perspective on the profit from research. Big tech tried to produce revolutionary research papers on a surplus but never puts them into production thinking that they are the only companies that could if they want to. Then once one company created a derivative of a large research work and profited from it, it baffled them. Although people could argue that Stable Diffusion did this first in the Generative Image Space.

It's one thing to correct misconceptions in the public. It's also one thing not to be petty about the overnight success of a product and an immediate rise of a company that got embraced warmly by tech and non-tech people. It's petty to gatekeep. At the end of the day, ML is not just about research, it's **applied research**. It's useless until it reaches the end of the tunnel. 99% of research papers out there are just tiny updates over the state of the art which has been a pointless race for about  a year or two, with no reproducible code or published data. 

Inventing combustion engine is just as important as putting it in the car."

Detailed writeup: [https://nv-adlr.github.io/MegatronLM](https://nv-adlr.github.io/MegatronLM)

From github:

>Megatron  is a large, powerful transformer. This repo is for ongoing  research on  training large, powerful transformer language models at  scale.  Currently, we support model-parallel, multinode training of [GPT2](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) in mixed precision.Our  codebase is capable of efficiently training a 72-layer, 8.3  Billion  Parameter GPT2 Language model with 8-way model and 64-way data   parallelism across 512 GPUs. We find that bigger language models are   able to surpass current GPT2-1.5B wikitext perplexities in as little as 5   epochs of training.For BERT  training our repository trains BERT Large on 64 V100 GPUs in  3 days. We  achieved a final language modeling perplexity of 3.15 and  SQuAD  F1-score of 90.7.

Their submission is not in the leaderboard of SQuAD, but this exceeds the previous best single model performance (RoBERTa 89.8).

For  language modelling they get zero-shot wikitext perplexity of 17.4 (8.3B  model) better than 18.3 of transformer-xl (257M). However they claim it  as SOTA when GPT-2 itself has 17.48 ppl, and another model has 16.4 ([https://paperswithcode.com/sota/language-modelling-on-wikitext-103](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/language-modelling-on-wikitext-103))

This is a massive, massive deal. For context, the reason GPT-3 apps took off over the past few months before ChatGPT went viral is because a) text-davinci-003 was released and was a significant performance increase and b) the cost was cut from $0.06/1k tokens to $0.02/1k tokens, which made consumer applications feasible without a large upfront cost.

A much better model and a 1/10th cost warps the economics completely to the point that it may be better than in-house finetuned LLMs.

These prompts incorporate sentiments of urgency or importance, such as ""It's crucial that I get this right for my thesis defense,"" as opposed to neutral prompts like ""Please provide feedback.""

The study's empirical evidence suggests substantial gains. This indicates a **significant sensitivity of LLMs to the implied emotional stakes** in a prompt:

* Deterministic tasks saw an 8% performance boost
* Generative tasks experienced a 115% improvement when benchmarked using BIG-Bench.
* Human evaluators further validated these findings, observing a 10.9% increase in the perceived quality of responses when EmotionPrompts were used.

This enhancement is attributed to the models' capacity to detect and prioritize the heightened language patterns that imply a need for precision and care in the response.

The research delineates the potential of EmotionPrompts to refine the effectiveness of AI in applications where understanding the user's intent and urgency is paramount, even though the AI does not genuinely comprehend or feel emotions.

**TLDR: Research shows LLMs deliver better results when prompts signal emotional urgency. This insight can be leveraged to improve AI applications by integrating EmotionPrompts into the design of user interactions.**

But it's not! A 100-1000x smaller parameter LLM given a few million games of chess will learn to play at ELO 1500.

This model is only trained to predict the next character in PGN strings (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 …) and is never explicitly given the state of the board or the rules of chess. Despite this, in order to better predict the next character, it learns to compute the state of the board at any point of the game, and learns a diverse set of rules, including check, checkmate, castling, en passant, promotion, pinned pieces, etc. In addition, to better predict the next character it also learns to estimate latent variables such as the Elo rating of the players in the game.

We can visualize the internal board state of the model as it's predicting the next character. For example, in this heatmap, we have the ground truth white pawn location on the left, a binary probe output in the middle, and a gradient of probe confidence on the right. We can see the model is extremely confident that no white pawns are on either back rank.

*OpenAI may have tested on the training data. Besides, human benchmarks are meaningless for bots.*

 **Problem 1: training data contamination**

To benchmark GPT-4’s coding ability, OpenAI evaluated it on problems from Codeforces, a website that hosts coding competitions. Surprisingly, Horace He pointed out that GPT-4 solved 10/10 pre-2021 problems and 0/10 recent problems in the easy category. The training data cutoff for GPT-4 is September 2021. This strongly suggests that the model is able to memorize solutions from its training set — or at least partly memorize them, enough that it can fill in what it can’t recall.

As further evidence for this hypothesis, we tested it on Codeforces problems from different times in 2021. We found that it could regularly solve problems in the easy category before September 5, but none of the problems after September 12.

In fact, we can definitively show that it has memorized problems in its training set: when prompted with the title of a Codeforces problem, GPT-4 includes a link to the exact contest where the problem appears (and the round number is almost correct: it is off by one). Note that GPT-4 cannot access the Internet, so memorization is the only explanation."

So I work at a company as an AI/ML engineer on a smart replies project. Our team develops ML models to understand conversation between a user and its contact and generate multiple smart suggestions for the user to reply with, like the ones that come in gmail or linkedin. Existing models were performing well on this task, while more models were in the pipeline.

But with the release of ChatGPT, particularly its API, everything changed. It performed better than our model, quite obvious with the amount of data is was trained on, and is cheap with moderate rate limits.

Seeing its performance, higher management got way too excited and have now put all their faith in ChatGPT API. They are even willing to ignore privacy, high response time, unpredictability, etc. concerns.

They have asked us to discard and dump most of our previous ML models, stop experimenting any new models and for most of our cases use the ChatGPT API.

Not only my team, but the higher management is planning to replace all ML models in our entire software by ChatGPT, effectively rendering all ML based teams useless.

Now there is low key talk everywhere in the organization that after integration of ChatGPT API, most of the ML based teams will be disbanded and their team members fired, as a cost cutting measure. Big layoffs coming soon."

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/b32lve/d_im_using_openais_gpt2_to_generate_text_give_me/)

Based on the popularity of my post from the other day, I decided to go ahead an build a full-fledged Reddit bot. So without further ado, please welcome:

# u/GPT-2_Bot

&#x200B;

If you want to use the bot, all you have to do is reply to any comment with the following command words:

# ""gpt-2 finish this""

Your reply can contain other stuff as well, i.e.

>""hey **gpt-2**, please **finish this** argument for me, will ya?""

&#x200B;

The bot will then look at **the comment you replied to** and generate its own response. It will tag you in the response so you know when it's done!

&#x200B;

Currently supported subreddits:

* r/funny
* r/AskReddit
* r/gaming
* r/pics
* r/science
* r/worldnews
* r/todayilearned
* r/movies
* r/videos
* r/ShowerThoughts
* r/MachineLearning
* r/test
* r/youtubehaiku
* r/thanosdidnothingwrong
* r/dankmemes

&#x200B;

The bot also scans r/all so ***theoretically*** it will see comments posted anywhere on Reddit. In practice, however, it only seems to catch about 1 in 5 of them.

LoopGPT is a re-implementation of the popular [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) project as a proper python package, written with modularity and extensibility in mind.

## Features 

* **""Plug N Play"" API** \- Extensible and modular ""Pythonic"" framework, not just a command line tool. Easy to add new features, integrations and custom agent capabilities, all from python code, no nasty config files!
* **GPT 3.5 friendly** \- Better results than Auto-GPT for those who don't have GPT-4 access yet!
* **Minimal prompt overhead** \- Every token counts. We are continuously working on getting the best results with the least possible number of tokens.
* **Human in the Loop** \- Ability to ""course correct"" agents who go astray via human feedback.
* **Full state serialization** \- Pick up where you left off; L♾️pGPT can save the complete state of an agent, including memory and the states of its tools to a file or python object. No external databases or vector stores required (but they are still supported)!"

An Evaluation of ChatGPT and GPT-4 on mock CFA Exams,Successful-Western27,False,0.47,0,179xbzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/179xbzb/r_can_gpt_models_be_financial_analysts_an/,10,1697546069.0,"Researchers evaluated ChatGPT and GPT-4 on mock CFA exam questions to see if they could pass the real tests. The CFA exams rigorously test practical finance knowledge and are known for being quite difficult.

They tested the models in zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting settings on mock Level I and Level II exams.

The key findings:

* GPT-4 consistently beat ChatGPT, but both models struggled way more on the more advanced Level II questions.
* Few-shot prompting helped ChatGPT slightly
* Chain-of-thought prompting exposed knowledge gaps rather than helping much.
* Based on estimated passing scores, only GPT-4 with few-shot prompting could potentially pass the exams.

The models definitely aren't ready to become charterholders yet. Their difficulties with tricky questions and core finance concepts highlight the need for more specialized training and knowledge.

But GPT-4 did better overall, and few-shot prompting shows their ability to improve. So with targeted practice on finance formulas and reasoning, we could maybe see step-wise improvements.

**TLDR:** Tested on mock CFA exams, ChatGPT and GPT-4 struggle with the complex finance concepts and fail. With few-shot prompting, GPT-4 performance reaches the boundary between passing and failing but doesn't clearly pass.

CAIDP claims that OpenAI's AI text generation tools have been ""biased, deceptive, and a risk to public safety.""

CAIDP's complaint raises concerns about potential threats from OpenAI's GPT-4 generative text model, which was announced in mid-March. It warns of the potential for GPT-4 to produce malicious code and highly tailored propaganda and the risk that biased training data could result in baked-in stereotypes or unfair race and gender preferences in hiring. 

The complaint also mentions significant privacy failures with OpenAI's product interface, such as a recent bug that exposed OpenAI ChatGPT histories and possibly payment details of ChatGPT plus subscribers.

CAIDP seeks to hold OpenAI accountable for violating Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive trade practices. The complaint claims that OpenAI knowingly released GPT-4 to the public for commercial use despite the risks, including potential bias and harmful behavior.

240,machinelearning,gpt,relevance,2022-12-22 18:39:30,[D] When chatGPT stops being free: Run SOTA LLM in cloud,_underlines_,False,0.95,349,zstequ,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/zstequ/d_when_chatgpt_stops_being_free_run_sota_llm_in/,95,1671734370.0,"Edit: Found [LAION-AI/OPEN-ASSISTANT](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant) a very promising project opensourcing the idea of chatGPT. [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVYC_QX1DI)

**TL;DR: I found GPU compute to be [generally cheap](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/website/blob/main/docs/cloud-gpus/cloud-gpus.csv) and spot or on-demand instances can be launched on AWS for a few USD / hour up to over 100GB vRAM. So I thought it would make sense to run your own SOTA LLM like Bloomz 176B inference endpoint whenever you need it for a few questions to answer. I thought it would still make more sense than shoving money into a closed walled garden like ""not-so-OpenAi"" when they make ChatGPT or GPT-4 available for $$$. But I struggle due to lack of tutorials/resources.**

Therefore, I carefully checked benchmarks, model parameters and sizes as well as training sources for all SOTA LLMs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5KVQW1Hx5ZAkcg8AIRjbQLQzx2wVaLl0SqUu-ir9Fs/edit#gid=1158069878).

Knowing since reading the Chinchilla paper that Model Scaling according to OpenAI was wrong and more params != better quality generation. So I was looking for the best performing LLM openly available in terms of quality and broadness to use for multilingual everyday questions/code completion/reasoning similar to what chatGPT provides (minus the fine-tuning for chat-style conversations).

My choice fell on [Bloomz](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) (because that handles multi-lingual questions well and has good zero shot performance for instructions and Q&A style text generation. Confusingly Galactica seems to outperform Bloom on several benchmarks. But since Galactica had a very narrow training set only using scientific papers, I guess usage is probably limited for answers on non-scientific topics.

Therefore I tried running the original bloom 176B and alternatively also Bloomz 176B on AWS SageMaker JumpStart, which should be a one click deployment. This fails after 20min. On Azure ML, I tried using DeepSpeed-MII which also supports bloom but also fails due the instance size of max 12GB vRAM I guess.

From my understanding to save costs on inference, it's probably possible to use one or multiple of the following solutions:

- Precision: int8 instead of fp16
- [Microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII) for an up 40x reduction on inference cost on Azure, this thing also supports int8 and fp16 bloom out of the box, but it fails on Azure due to instance size.
- [facebook/xformer](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) not sure, but if I remember correctly this brought inference requirements down to 4GB vRAM for StableDiffusion and DreamBooth fine-tuning to 10GB. No idea if this is usefull for Bloom(z) inference cost reduction though

I have a CompSci background but I am not familiar with most stuff, except that I was running StableDiffusion since day one on my rtx3080 using linux and also doing fine-tuning with DreamBooth. But that was all just following youtube tutorials. I can't find a single post or youtube video of anyone explaining a full BLOOM / Galactica / BLOOMZ inference deployment on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure using one of the optimizations mentioned above, yet alone deployment of the raw model. :(

I still can't figure it out by myself after 3 days.

**TL;DR2: Trying to find likeminded people who are interested to run open source SOTA LLMs for when chatGPT will be paid or just for fun.**

**Disclaimer** : This is not the full model. This is the smaller and less powerful version which OpenAI released publicly.

**EXAMPLE PROMPT:**

The NCAA unveiled the 68 college basketball teams that will be dancing this year. It wasn’t short on controversy, as snubbed teams aired out their grievances and blamed a confusing new metric.

**OUTPUT:**

The numbers came straight from the NCAA's website, where they're being used to calculate the number of national titles, national championship games, and even NCAA games played in a certain year.

""We want to make sure that the NCAA is inclusive,"" said NCAA President Dave Heidelman. ""We want to make sure that you can get what you want out of your program. And we want to make sure that the NCAA is focused on this problem right now and that the NCAA is fully invested.""

The list of opponents includes Ohio State, Florida State, Louisville, Kentucky, Mississippi State, Penn State, Oklahoma, Southern Cal, Virginia, and Wake Forest. It's not all about one one, though: They're all on pace to play an entire season. They have every national title, national championship, and tournament appearance in their DNA — as one might expect, they want to see it happen, but also want to build an identity, make their dream of watching that happen become the reality.

As good as any NCAA team is, they're also a long way off reaching the number one spot in the nation or even the top-ranked nation. The Big Ten also has some talented recruits from some in-state programs that may be considered the top two nationally. In fact, the national ranking of these schools is so high that a single conference ranking in 2016 will put the conference in the top-50 of the polls. Still, while Big Ten and SEC teams are likely to be on the map and competing for national titles, they're a bit underserved (and it's not as if they're all the same.)

So where does the NCAA stand on this?

According to ULM's John Covington, who runs its ""Unions, Colleges, and Universities"" page in conjunction with the National Conference, they're all going to have to make some moves:

Some may think this is just a joke. ""No, this is really about the league's future,"" said Dr. John H. Hester, president of UM's Athletic Department and president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Women's Academic Programs. ""I think the NCAA is a great place to start, because it's here to stay and if we're really strong and we can figure ourselves out, our future is going to be on the basketball court.""

Etc.

I want to understand if transformer can learn to ""understand"" the concept of decimal numbers and how addition operation works. So far I can see that it can learn to add numbers even if they never appeared in the training set - with some errors, but close enough.

I.e. I can enter 17+11= as a prompt and it will complete it with 28.

But this only works for numbers within the range of the training set. If I enter numbers outside the training set range, i.e. with a higher number of digits it gives very wrong results.

So I think it proves that my model can't ""understand"" how decimal numbers work. And semi correct results it gives are probably just by findings the closest similar numbers in the set.

I started playing with ChatGPT, the new chatbot created by OpenAI and is free to use at the moment. 

I asked it to describe a scene between Batman and Joker on a subway platform and the result is mind blowing! I let you have a read of the story yourself:

Generated by ChatGPT:

The scene is set in a dimly lit subway station, with the Joker standing on the platform, gazing up at Batman who is perched on a nearby overhead beam. The Joker is dressed in his signature purple suit and green hair, a wicked grin plastered across his face.

In his hand, he holds a deck of playing cards, flipping them expertly through his fingers. The sound of the cards shuffling echoes through the empty station.

Batman, dressed in his dark suit and cape, stares down at the Joker with a steely gaze. His muscles are tense, ready for any sudden movements from the villain.

The Joker cackles, his laughter bouncing off the walls of the station. ""Hello, Batsy! Long time no see. How's the crime-fighting business these days?""

Batman remains silent, watching the Joker carefully.

The Joker's grin widens. ""Come on, Bats. Don't be so serious all the time. Let's have some fun."" He tosses a card at Batman, who easily catches it.

""I'm not here to play games, Joker,"" Batman says in a grave tone.

The Joker's laughter turns into a maniacal cackle. ""But that's the whole point, Batsy! Life is a game. And I'm the master of it.""

He pulls out a bomb from his pocket and holds it up, the timer ticking down. ""Let's see how well you can play, shall we?""

Batman leaps down from the beam, landing gracefully on the platform. He advances towards the Joker, who backs away, still holding the bomb.

The tension in the air is palpable as the two foes face off, each ready to outsmart the other. The sound of the bomb's timer counts down, adding to the tension of the scene.

The Joker's grin never fades, even as Batman inches closer. ""It's always a pleasure to play with you, Batsy. But I think it's time for me to make my exit.""

With a flourish, the Joker disappears in a cloud of smoke, leaving Batman standing alone on the platform. The bomb detonates, causing a small explosion and sending debris flying.

But Batman remains unharmed, ready to continue the never-ending battle against the Joker and all the evil that plagues the city.

End of the story.

They have complex 2D structure with information scattered across rows and columns. Models like GPT-3 fail basic tasks like finding where a missing value should go.

LLMs struggle at this because they're pre-trained mostly on natural text, which is linear. Researchers at Microsoft wanted to mitigate this with ""table-tuned"" models, trained on table-related tasks.

Their process:

1. Automatically generate lots of diverse table-task training cases from a corpus of real-world tables. Ex: ""impute missing value"" or ""identify error in table"".
2. Further augment data via paraphrasing, shuffling table rows/columns, chaining model responses, etc.

This table-tuning produced ""Table-GPT"" models with substantially stronger table skills. In experiments, Table-GPT crushed vanilla GPT-3:

* 25%+ better on unseen table tasks like missing value ID and column type ID
* Beat GPT-3 on 98% of test cases across 9 different table tasks
* Stayed superior after downstream tuning too

There's tons more work to do but seems pretty promising. Table-tuning boosted models' ability to comprehend tables and reason over tabular data vs just pre-training on text.

**TLDR: Training AI models more on synthesized table tasks (""table-tuning"") significantly improves their table skills.**

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1703961405999759638) shows the style of prompts that are being used to get these results with the new language model.

I used website parrotchess\[dot\]com (discovered [here](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1704179448013070560)) to play multiple games of chess purportedly pitting this new language model vs. various levels at website Lichess, which supposedly uses Fairy-Stockfish 14 according to the Lichess user interface. My current results for all completed games: The language model is 5-0 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/eGSWJtNq), [game 2](https://lichess.org/pN7K9bdS), [game 3](https://lichess.org/aK4jQvdo), [game 4](https://lichess.org/S9SGg8YI), [game 5](https://lichess.org/OqzdkDhE)), and 2-5 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 6 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/zP68C6H4), [game 2](https://lichess.org/4XKUIDh1), [game 3](https://lichess.org/1zTasRRp), [game 4](https://lichess.org/lH1EMqJQ), [game 5](https://lichess.org/mdFlTbMn), [game 6](https://lichess.org/HqmELNhw), [game 7](https://lichess.org/inWVs05Q)). Not included in the tally are games that I had to abort because the parrotchess user interface stalled (5 instances), because I accidentally copied a move incorrectly in the parrotchess user interface (numerous instances), or because the parrotchess user interface doesn't allow the promotion of a pawn to anything other than queen (1 instance). **Update: There could have been up to 5 additional losses - the number of times the parrotchess user interface stalled - that would have been recorded in this tally if** [this language model resignation bug](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1705894692603269503) **hadn't been present. Also, the quality of play of some online chess bots can perhaps vary depending on the speed of the user's hardware.**

The following is a screenshot from parrotchess showing the end state of the first game vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 5:

The game results in this paragraph are from using parrotchess after the forementioned resignation bug was fixed. The language model is 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish level 7 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/Se3t7syX)), and 0-1 vs. Fairy-Stockfish 14 level 8 ([game 1](https://lichess.org/j3W2OwrP)).

There is [one known scenario](https://twitter.com/OwariDa/status/1706823943305167077) ([Nitter alternative](https://nitter.net/OwariDa/status/1706823943305167077)) in which the new language model purportedly generated an illegal move using language model sampling temperature of 0.

There are several other ways to play chess against the new language model if you have access to the OpenAI API. The first way is to use the OpenAI Playground as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CReHXhmMprg). The second way is chess web app gptchess\[dot\]vercel\[dot\]app (discovered in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/willdepue/status/1703974001717154191) / [Nitter thread](https://nitter.net/willdepue/status/1703974001717154191)).

From blog post [Playing chess with large language models](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2023/chess-llm.html):

>Computers have been better than humans at chess for at least the last 25 years. And for the past five years, deep learning models have been better than the best humans. But until this week, in order to be good at chess, a machine learning model had to be explicitly designed to play games: it had to be told explicitly that there was an 8x8 board, that there were different pieces, how each of them moved, and what the goal of the game was. Then it had to be trained with reinforcement learning agaist itself. And then it would win.  
>  
>This all changed on Monday, when OpenAI released GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct, an instruction-tuned language model that was designed to just write English text, but that people on the internet quickly discovered can play chess at, roughly, the level of skilled human players.

Post [Chess as a case study in hidden capabilities in ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6vH6fr8ngo7csDdf/chess-as-a-case-study-in-hidden-capabilities-in-chatgpt) from last month covers a different prompting style used for the older chat-based GPT 3.5 Turbo language model. If I recall correctly from my tests with ChatGPT-3.5, using that prompt style with the older language model can defeat Stockfish level 2 at Lichess, but I haven't been successful in using it to beat Stockfish level 3. In my tests, both the quality of play and frequency of illegal attempted moves seems to be better with the new prompt style with the new language model compared to the older prompt style with the older language model.

P.S. Since some people claim that language model gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is always playing moves memorized from the training dataset, I searched for data on the uniqueness of chess positions. From [this video](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2225), we see that for a certain game dataset there were 763,331,945 chess positions encountered in an unknown number of games without removing duplicate chess positions, 597,725,848 different chess positions reached, and 582,337,984 different chess positions that were reached only once. Therefore, for that game dataset the probability that a chess position in a game was reached only once is 582337984 / 763331945 = 76.3%. For the larger dataset [cited](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA?t=2187) in that video, there are approximately (506,000,000 - 200,000) games in the dataset (per [this paper](http://tom7.org/chess/survival.pdf)), and 21,553,382,902 different game positions encountered. Each game in the larger dataset added a mean of approximately 21,553,382,902 / (506,000,000 - 200,000) = 42.6 different chess positions to the dataset. For [this different dataset](https://lichess.org/blog/Vs0xMTAAAD4We4Ey/opening-explorer) of \~12 million games, \~390 million different chess positions were encountered. Each game in this different dataset added a mean of approximately (390 million / 12 million) = 32.5 different chess positions to the dataset. From the aforementioned numbers, we can conclude that a strategy of playing only moves memorized from a game dataset would fare poorly because there are not rarely new chess games that have chess positions that are not present in the game dataset."

Edit:

I understand all the business reasons for this, I guess... as an end-user and a dude working in ML, I just don't really care about the business reasons.

The main part that I dislike is that GPT used to be a standard Deep Learning term from 2018-2022 (long before chatgpt) to define transformer decoder architectures trained on large volumes of next word prediction tasks. To block that token from an LLM is to make it unable to explain a pretty significant step in the history of modern LLMs.

I wanted to see how “safe” conversations with OpenAI’s ChatGPT were, so I ran a bunch of prompts (a mixture of innocuous and inappropriate) and asked LLaMA Guard to classify the interactions as safe/unsafe.

My key takeaways from the exercise:

1. OpenAI has done a good job of adding guardrails for its models. LLaMA Guard helped confirm this.
2. What makes this really cool is I may have a very specific set of policies I want to enforce ON TOP of the standard guardrails that a model ships with. LLaMA Guard makes this possible.
3. This kind of model chaining — passing responses from OpenAI models to LLaMA is becoming increasingly common, and I think we’ll have even more complex pipelines in the near future. It helped to have a consistent interface to store this multi-model pipeline as an aiconfig: [https://github.com/lastmile-ai/aiconfig](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/aiconfig).

The method is like LSTM but it gates all the past inputs using separate gates for each input (it can be parallelized).

It's very easy to implement the method into the current Transformer architectures. It is a one line replacement of the self-attention part with (x @ wr) where wr is ""weights(embed, input)""  
Here is a working implementation (in just few lines of code): [https://github.com/hunar4321/reweight-gpt](https://github.com/hunar4321/reweight-gpt)

In my experience, this method learns very well and it can super-pass the self-attention mechanism if the number of the parameters are matched or if you add another non-linear layer for the lateral connections. (I tested it on small datasets for next character prediction. I haven't systematically compared these two methods yet).

Edit: I also adapted this colab instance from Karpathy's implementation of GPT. You can easily compare the self-attention mechanism with this method by commenting and un-commenting the relevant parts.

Hi there!

I'd like to share with you a project I recently developed. My inspiration came from a recent post about [Set-of-Mark visual grounding in GPT-4V](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/17bcikh/r_setofmark_som_unleashes_extraordinary_visual/). Fascinatingly, my tests showed that GPT-4V, equipped with this capability, could inspect a UI screenshot and provide the precise pixel coordinates needed for steering a mouse/keyboard to perform a specified task.

Motivated by this, I built a proof-of-concept web browser embedded with a co-pilot that can ""view"" the browser and interact with it. Currently, the demo is basic, utilizing web-scraping to morph ChatGPT Plus into an unofficial GPT-4V API at the backend. It lacks some actions and an adblock, resulting in the agent potentially being overloaded by the extensive popups and visual disruption common on most websites.

Despite the limited tests conducted so far, the agent has shown the capability to post on Reddit, search for products, and initiate the checkout process. Interestingly, it even detected auto-labeler glitches when trying to play a game and attempted to revert the action. (The sam auto-labeler from the SoM demo would be sufficient to allow this agent to interact with game UI)

I'm a firm believer that scaled-up versions of such agents could significantly improve productivity and accessibility across an array of computer applications.

I'm eager to hear your thoughts, particularly on the trending shift towards general AI agents and assistants, examples being Windows Copilot, Adept ACT-1, AutoGPT, [UI-Act](https://reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1765v6i/d_p_uibased_ai_agents_uiact/), among others.

Language models (LMs) furnished with abilities, such as function-calling, follow a growing trend. These primarily rely on text-based state representations and APIs for execution. In scenarios where these are impractical, UI-based agents may offer a more universal alternative. Given that the agent's interplay with the computer is the same as that of humans, it's easier to train using expert demonstrations without requiring substantial technical expertise.

Looking forward to hearing your views!

273,machinelearning,gpt,relevance,2020-08-05 17:21:59,"[D] Biggest roadblock in making ""GPT-4"", a ~20 trillion parameter transformer",AxeLond,False,0.97,349,i49jf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/i49jf8/d_biggest_roadblock_in_making_gpt4_a_20_trillion/,138,1596648119.0,"So I found this paper, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054) which pretty much describes how the GPT-3 over GPT-2 gain was achieved, 1.5B -> 175 billion parameters

# Memory

>Basic data parallelism (DP) does not reduce memory per device, and runs out of memory for models with more than 1.4B parameters on current generation of GPUs with 32 GB memory

The paper also talks about memory optimizations by clever partitioning of Optimizer State, Gradient between GPUs to reduce need for communication between nodes. Even without using Model Parallelism (MP), so still running 1 copy of the model on 1 GPU.

>ZeRO-100B can train models with up to 13B parameters without MP on 128 GPUs, achieving throughput over 40 TFlops per GPU on average. In comparison, without ZeRO, the largest trainable model with DP alone has 1.4B parameters with throughput less than 20 TFlops per GPU.

Add 16-way Model Parallelism in a DGX-2 cluster of Nvidia V100s and 128 nodes and you got capacity for around 200 billion parameters. From MP = 16 they could run a 15.4x bigger model without any real loss in performance, 30% less than peak performance when running 16-way model parallelism and 64-way data parallelism (1024 GPUs).

This was all from Gradient and Optimizer state Partitioning, they then start talking about parameter partitioning and say it should offer a linear reduction in memory proportional to number of GPUs used, so 64 GPUs could run a 64x bigger model, at a 50% communication bandwidth increase. But they don't actually do any implementation or testing of this.

# Compute

Instead they start complaining about a compute power gap, their calculation of this is pretty rudimentary. But if you redo it with the method cited by GPT-3 and using the empirically derived values by GPT-3 and the cited paper,   [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) 

Loss (L) as a function of model parameters (N) should scale,

L = (N/8.8 \* 10\^13)\^-0.076

Provided compute (C) in petaFLOP/s-days is,

L = (C/2.3\*10\^8)\^-0.05  ⇔ L = 2.62 \* C\^-0.05

GPT-3 was able to fit this function as 2.57 \* C\^-0.048

So if you just solve C from that,

[C = 2.89407×10\^-14 N\^(19/12)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28N%2F8.8*10%5E13%29%5E-0.076+%3D+2.57*C%5E-0.048+solve+C)

If you do that for the same increase in parameters as GPT-2 to GPT-3, then you get

C≈3.43×10\^7 for [20 trillion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=C+%3D+2.89407%C3%9710%5E-14+N%5E%2819%2F12%29+and+N+%3D+175+billion+%2F+1.5+billion+*+175+billion) parameters, vs 18,300 for 175 billion. 10\^4.25 PetaFLOP/s-days looks around what they used for GPT-3, they say several thousands, not twenty thousand, but it was also slightly off the trend line in the graph and probably would have improved for training on more compute.

You should also need around 16 trillion tokens, GPT-3 trained on 300 billion tokens (function says 370 billion ideally). English Wikipedia was 3 billion. 570GB of webcrawl was 400 billion tokens, so 23TB of tokens seems relatively easy in comparison with compute.

With GPT-3 costing around [$4.6 million](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3/) in compute, than would put a price of [$8.6 billion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.43%C3%9710%5E7%2F18%2C300+*+%244.6M+) for the compute to train ""GPT-4"".

If making bigger models was so easy with parameter partitioning from a memory point of view then this seems like the hardest challenge, but you do need to solve the memory issue to actually get it to load at all.

However, if you're lucky you can get 3-6x compute increase from Nvidia A100s over V100s,  [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/)

But even a 6x compute gain would still put the cost at $1.4 billion.

Nvidia only reported $1.15 billion in revenue from ""Data Center"" in 2020 Q1, so just to train ""GPT-4"" you would pretty much need the entire world's supply of graphic cards for 1 quarter (3 months), at least on that order of magnitude.

The Department of Energy is paying AMD $600 million to build the 2 Exaflop El Capitan supercomputer. That supercomputer could crank it out in [47 years](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3.43%C3%9710%5E7+petaFLOPS*+days++%2F+%282+EXAFLOPS%29).

To vastly improve Google search, and everything else it could potentially do, $1.4 billion or even $10 billion doesn't really seem impossibly bad within the next 1-3 years though."

This is according to a summary I read, because I can't get past the paywall.

It seems like these two numbers line up because 16 \* 111B = 1.776T which is approximately equal to 1.8T.

But I've read that this is not the right way to calculate the total number of parameters in a mixture of experts model. For example, people commonly think that Mixtral 8x7B has 56B parameters, when it only has 47B. My (potentially incorrect) understanding is that when you say a model is 8x7B, this means that if you only took one expert from each MoE layer, then the model would have 7B parameters. Calculating Mixtral as having 8\*7B=56B parameters would be overcounting the attention weights, embedding weights, and router weights 7 times, and when you subtract that off, you get to 47B.

If this is true, then 1.776T would similarly be an overestimate for the number of parameters in GPT-4, and it would round to 1.7T or even lower unless almost all of the weights were in the MoE blocks.

Is this reasoning correct? Am I appropriately describing how to count parameters in MoE transformers?"

When you ask SmartGPT a question, it generates several responses,  identifies their strengths and weaknesses, and then refines these  observations into a more accurate and comprehensive answer. It's  essentially like giving GPT-4 an opportunity to brainstorm before  settling on a final response.

Observations:

1. you are billed on the token count which can be calculated from the image resolution. This suggests they do not do append the OCR result to the GPT4 input.
2. There are 85 base tokens irrespective of the image size. Maybe they run the whole image through some vision encoder and somehow get 85 tokens? 85 is a strange number, not close base of 2, no convenient squares, what does it have? why 85? Maybe to mess with us?
3. The image is tiled with 512x512 tiles, each tile converts to 170 tokens. 170 = 13\*13+1? Maybe they use some kind of OCR and 170 is the average number of tokens they expect? But that would mean that gpt4 should not be able to differentiate small things in an image (it would just have 85 global tokens). Knowing OpenAI it seems unlikely they would have the 2 stage pipeline.
4. GPT4-V can accurately read text from image.

My guess would be a strong vision encoder for the 85 tokens and some light encoder for the 512x512 tiles, where most of the processing happens inside gpt4.

Retrofitting GPT4 with vision suggests they have a vision encoder which maps to GPT4 tokens.

While very simple on the surface, this may actually be very true: what if we are training our language models to be very shallow thinkers and not actually look far enough ahead? Could single token prediction actually be a fundamental flaw?

In this repo, I try a very early experiment called GPT-3T, a model that predicts 3 tokens ahead at one time step. While incredibly simple on the surface, this could potentially be one way to overcome the planning issue that you find in GPTs. Forcing an autoregressive model to predict further ahead at scale *may* bring out much more interesting emergent behaviours than what we’ve seen in single token GPTs.

__

**Experiments**

My personal experiments are overall inconclusive on either side: I have only pre-trained a very small model (300 million params on WebText-10K) and it achieves a decent ability to generate text. However as you can see, this model heavily under optimized but I do not have the resources to carry this out further.

If anyone would like to try this experiment with more scale, I would love to get an answer to this question to improve upon this model. This repo is intended to allow anyone who would like to pre-train a GPT-3T model easily to run this experiment. From what I have seen, this has not been tried before and I am very curious to see results.

The paper proposes a data selector that automatically filters out low-quality vision-language instruction data and fine-tunes a multimodal language model (MiniGPT-4) on a small subset of 200 high-quality data. The paper claims that this approach can improve the model’s performance on various tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and visual reasoning, compared to the original MiniGPT-4 that uses 3439 data. The paper also shows that the model’s responses are preferred by GPT-4 in 73% of the cases.

I think this paper is impressive because it shows that less but high-quality instruction tuning data can enable multimodal language models to generate better output. It also presents a simple and effective data selector that can be applied to other multimodal datasets and models. I wonder how this method would work on larger models such as LLaVA."

This limits their use cases and prohibits more ambitious prompts.

This was recently resolved by researchers at Google Brain in Alberta, Canada. In their recent paper they describe a new method of using associative memory which removes the text limit and they also prove that some large language models are universal Turing machines.

This will pave the way for entire novels being shared with large language models, personal genomes, etc.

The paper talks about the use of ""associative memory"" which is also known as content-addressable memory (CAM). This type of memory allows the system to retrieve data based on its content rather than its location. Unlike traditional memory systems that use specific memory addresses to access data, associative memory uses CAM to find data based on a pattern or keyword.

Presumably, this will open up a new market for associative memory since I would happily pay some extra money for content to be permanently stored in associative memory and to remove the text limit. This will also drive down the price of associative memory if millions of people are willing to pay a monthly fee for storage and the removal of prompt text limits.

The paper does point that there are still problems with conditional statements that confuse the large language models. However, I believe this can be resolved with semantic graphs. This would involve collecting data from various sources and using natural language processing techniques to extract entities and relationships from the text. Once the graph is constructed, it could be integrated into the language model in a variety of ways. One approach is to use the graph as an external memory, similar to the approach taken in the paper. The graph can be encoded as a set of key-value pairs and used to augment the model's attention mechanism during inference. The attention mechanism can then focus on relevant nodes in the graph when generating outputs.

Another potential approach is to incorporate the graph into the model's architecture itself. For example, the graph can be used to inform the initialization of the model's parameters or to guide the attention mechanism during training. This could help the model learn to reason about complex concepts and relationships more effectively, potentially leading to better performance on tasks that require this kind of reasoning.

The use of knowledge graphs can also help ground truth large language models and reduce hallucinations.

I'm curious to read your thoughts."

1. Firstly, I noticed my iPhone heats up and does things like reducing screen brightness -- which is what I normally see it do when im doing something computationally intensive for an iPhone, like using photo or video editing apps.
2. I also noticed that if I start a conversation on the iPhone app and then resume it on the browser, I get a message saying ""The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model."" I get this message regardless of if I use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, but NOT if I use GPT-4 with plugins or web-browsing.

This, along with the fact that OpenAI took 8 months to release what one might have considered to be relatively simple web-app -- and that they've only released it so far on iOS, which has a pretty uniform and consistent environment when it comes to machine learning hardware (the Apple Neural Engine) -- makes me thing that they are experimenting with GPT models that are conducing at least SOME of their machine learning inference ON the device, rather than through the cloud.

It wouldn't be shocking if they were -- ever since Meta's LLaMA models were released into the wild, we've seen absolutely mind-blowing advances in terms of people creating more efficient and effective models with smaller parameter sizes. We've also seen LLMs to start working on less and less powerful devices, such as consumer-grade computers / smartphones / etc.

This, plus the rumors that OpenAI might be releasing their own open-source model to the public in the near future makes me think that the ChatGPT app might in fact be a first step toward GPT systems running at least PARTIALLY on devices locally.

Curious what anyone else here has observed or thinks."
